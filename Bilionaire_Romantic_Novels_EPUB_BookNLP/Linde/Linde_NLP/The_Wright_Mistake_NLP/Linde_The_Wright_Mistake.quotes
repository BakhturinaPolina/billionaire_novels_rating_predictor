497	540	541	541	I	52	“ Landon and the Wrights all invited a bunch of people to come hang out . I know your … issues with Austin , so I did n’t mention it before . But I do n’t think that should stop you now . ”
544	570	541	541	I	52	“ Austin Wright is the biggest alcoholic jackass on this side of the planet ! You know how he treated me when we were together . ”
571	574	575	575	she	214	“ True , ”
578	625	575	575	she	214	“ But … it was a year and a half ago when you were together . And , since you slapped the shit out of him last fall , he ’s kind of avoided you like the plague , which means , you should be fine . ”

1344	1347	1348	1348	Heidi	594	“ Um … ”

1366	1369	1354	1354	her	594	“ Mostly ? ”

1420	1433	1408	1408	Landon	52	“ What happened to all the hot , eligible bachelors , Heidi ? ”
1450	1454	1434	1434	She	594	“ About that — ”
1455	1464	1467	1467	I	52	“ Oh , you ’re such a bitch . ”

1684	1690	1691	1691	I	52	“ What are you doing ? ”
1694	1705	1691	1691	I	52	“ Taking a swim . Come with me , lover . ”
1706	1719	1727	1727	She	594	“ Uh , no . I do not have a swimsuit on . ”
1720	1726	1727	1727	She	594	“ That ’s no fun . ”
1774	1779	1762	1762	she	594	“ You ’re crazy ! ”
1780	1793	1762	1762	she	594	“ Oh my God , get in ! The water is amazing ! ”
1794	1806	1807	1807	Heidi	594	“ No chance in hell . I have to change first . ”
1814	1825	1807	1807	Heidi	594	“ You ’re missing out . Emery would do it . ”
1826	1839	1762	1762	she	594	“ Do n’t care . You ca n’t goad me into this . ”
1840	1859	1807	1807	Heidi	594	“ Aw , I just want you to have some fun . Since you finally ditched Mr. Boring . ”
1860	1866	1867	1867	Heidi	594	“ He was not boring . ”
1875	1881	1882	1882	she	594	“ He was so boring , ”
1891	1906	1882	1882	she	594	“ My girl is fire and passion and tattoos and top - shelf whiskey . ”
1907	1916	1917	1917	I	52	“ You must be thinking of someone else , ”
1920	1929	1917	1917	I	52	“ Come on . Show me those tattoos ! ”
1930	1951	1952	1952	Heidi	594	“ Later ! When I have a freaking swimsuit on . Unless you are just dying to see my thong . ”
1957	1969	1952	1952	Heidi	594	“ I bet everyone here would die to see your thong . ”
1970	1975	1917	1917	I	52	“ You ’re incorrigible . ”
1976	1984	1985	1985	I	52	“ Would you rather talk about Trevor ? ”
1990	1999	1985	1985	I	52	“ Let ’s go back to my thong . ”
2000	2006	1952	1952	Heidi	594	“ Did someone say thong ? ”
2186	2201	2202	2202	I	52	“ Shocking that you showed up right when we were talking about my underwear , ”
2205	2215	2216	2216	Austin	52	“ Good to see you , too , babe , ”
2222	2230	2216	2216	Austin	52	“ Wish I could say the same . ”
2283	2290	2291	2291	Patrick	1597	“ What ’s up , Julia ? ”
2294	2299	2300	2300	Heidi	594	“ Y’all coming in ? ”
2306	2310	2300	2300	Heidi	594	“ Hell yes ! ”
2344	2357	2334	2334	She	594	“ Austin , man , we need something to float our beer ! ”
2358	2369	2370	2370	I	52	“ Oh , you ’re drunk already and still drinking , ”
2373	2377	2378	2378	Austin	52	“ How shocking ! ”
2391	2403	2387	2387	he	52	“ Heard you broke up with that tool you were seeing . ”
2404	2415	2387	2387	he	52	“ Not that it ’s any of your fucking business . ”
2416	2430	2387	2387	he	52	“ Just trying to figure out why you ’re still acting like this . ”
2431	2435	2436	2436	I	52	“ Like what ? ”
2448	2459	2440	2440	I	52	“ Like you ’ve got a stick up your ass . ”
2471	2485	2486	2486	He	52	“ And not even the way that you like it either , babe . ”
2494	2502	2503	2503	He	52	“ Why are you such a dick ? ”
2509	2516	2517	2517	I	52	“ Just your average Prince Charming . ”
2520	2530	2517	2517	I	52	“ There ’s nothing about you that ’s charming . ”
2531	2540	2543	2543	he	52	“ Nothing about me that ’s average either . ”
2619	2625	2609	2609	I	52	“ Fuck off , Austin . ”
2652	2657	2639	2639	Austin	52	“ Come with me . ”
2658	2669	2639	2639	Austin	52	“ What part of fuck off did you not understand ? ”
2670	2673	2639	2639	Austin	52	“ Swimming . ”
2674	2677	2639	2639	Austin	52	“ What ? ”
2924	2935	2936	2936	he	52	“ Fuck , I love getting you wet , Jules , ”
2950	2954	2955	2955	Julia	47	“ You motherfucker ! ”
2993	3001	2987	2987	She	47	“ Do n’t fucking laugh at me . ”
3013	3018	3019	3020	The girl	47	“ Shit , Jules ! ”
3066	3073	3074	3074	Heidi	594	“ Austin , leave her alone , ”
3082	3089	3090	3090	I	52	“ It was just a joke , ”
3124	3134	3135	3135	I	52	“ Seriously , Jules , lighten up a bit , ”
3388	3394	3395	3395	Julia	47	“ You ruined my shoes , ”
3432	3443	3422	3422	Heidi	594	“ Why do you have to be such a dick ? ”
3444	3452	3453	3453	Patrick	1597	“ He really ca n’t help it , ”
3456	3461	3453	3453	Patrick	1597	“ Thanks , bro . ”
3555	3582	3545	3545	she	594	“ I brought her here to help her get over her breakup , not so that you could be an asshole to her , like usual . ”
3591	3600	3601	3601	Heidi	594	“ You all take this way too seriously . ”
3606	3614	3601	3601	Heidi	594	“ You do n’t take anything seriously . ”
3640	3643	3644	3644	Patrick	1597	“ Women . ”
3658	3667	3652	3652	Heidi	594	“ Man , you are so done for . ”
3668	3673	3644	3644	Patrick	1597	“ Whatever , man . ”
3674	3692	3693	3693	I	52	“ Oh , fuck off , Austin . You ’re so going to fuck Julia this weekend . ”
3696	3702	3703	3703	Patrick	1597	“ Nothing wrong with that . ”
3723	3732	3707	3707	he	1597	“ She ’s so fucking pissed at you . ”
3748	3755	3733	3733	I	52	“ She ’ll get over it . ”
3756	3769	3733	3733	I	52	“ I ’d almost think that you were n’t totally into her . ”
3770	3773	3774	3774	Patrick	1597	“ Whatever . ”
3784	3805	3778	3778	he	1597	“ I ca n’t wait to watch this play out . I sure hope you keep acting like an idiot . ”
3806	3816	3778	3778	he	1597	“ Well , look what the cat dragged in , ”
3927	3930	3931	3931	I	52	“ Morgan , ”
3937	3953	3931	3931	I	52	“ Here I thought , we ’d never see you out of a business suit . ”
3954	3979	3980	3980	she	260	“ Traded it in for something cuter . What do you think the board would say if I showed up in this suit instead ? ”
4068	4074	4075	4075	I	52	“ Probably start a riot , ”
4079	4082	4083	4083	she	269	“ Indeed , ”
4097	4116	4083	4083	she	269	“ Now , tell me what you idiots did to upset Julia already ? We just got here ! ”
4122	4129	4117	4117	Patrick	1597	“ Do n’t look at me . ”
4130	4142	4083	4083	she	269	“ Oh , who ’s surprised that Austin is the troublemaker ? ”
4143	4154	4117	4117	Patrick	1597	“ I just pulled her into the water with me . ”
4155	4159	4160	4160	Patrick	1597	“ Fully clothed , ”
4170	4187	4163	4163	Morgan	64	“ I have the power to relegate you to the couch . So , watch yourself . ”
4188	4196	4197	4197	I	52	“ Oh no , not the couch ! ”
4207	4223	4197	4197	I	52	“ I ’ll make it up to you , Mor . How about a hug ? ”
4224	4230	4231	4231	she	64	“ Do n’t you dare , ”
4276	4295	4296	4296	Patrick	1597	“ I think she ’ll make you sleep on the roof if you throw her into the water , ”
4299	4312	4296	4296	Patrick	1597	“ It ’s Jensen ’s house . He ’ll get a say . ”
4313	4320	4321	4321	Morgan	64	“ He always sides with me , ”
4340	4356	4330	4330	She	64	“ And you wo n’t even get the roof when I ’m done with you . ”
4357	4362	4363	4363	I	52	“ Fine . Fine , ”
4373	4377	4363	4363	I	52	“ You win . ”
4378	4389	4390	4390	Morgan	64	“ Do n’t think I do n’t know your tricks , ”
4393	4402	4403	4403	I	52	“ I bow to thee , fair maiden . ”
4427	4441	4420	4420	She	64	“ If you throw me in that water , I will murder you ! ”
4504	4513	4495	4495	she	64	“ Come on . Dinner is almost ready , ”
4744	4749	4750	4750	I	52	“ What ’s up ? ”
4753	4762	4750	4750	I	52	“ Heard you threw Julia into the lake . ”
4763	4770	4739	4739	his	1111	“ I did n’t throw her . ”
4771	4774	4775	4775	Jensen	1111	“ Semantics , ”
4778	4828	4829	4829	Jensen	1111	“ I do n’t care what you do , Austin . Just trying to make this as much of a drama - free weekend as possible . I know that ’s nearly impossible when we get the whole Wright family together , but do n’t start shit , okay ? ”
4886	4896	4897	4897	Jensen	1111	“ Yeah . Sure . I ’ll do that . ”
5004	5008	4994	4994	he	1111	“ Girl Scouts , ”
5088	5091	5081	5081	I	52	“ Hey , ”
5103	5108	5092	5092	I	52	“ This seat taken ? ”
5139	5142	5126	5126	she	47	“ Depends . ”
5143	5147	5126	5126	she	47	“ On what ? ”
5148	5157	5158	5158	I	52	“ If you ’re done being a dick . ”
5166	5170	5171	5171	She	47	“ Probably not . ”
5178	5183	5171	5171	She	47	“ Of course not . ”
5184	5200	5126	5126	she	47	“ So , you have n’t gotten over me pulling you into the lake then ? ”
5201	5210	5171	5171	She	47	“ Is this your idea of an apology ? ”
5211	5214	5171	5171	She	47	“ No . ”
5215	5227	5228	5228	Her	47	“ You ’re really insufferable , you know that , right ? ”
5239	5247	5233	5233	she	47	“ Maybe you should have a drink . ”
5256	5280	5248	5248	I	52	“ That ’s your answer to everything . Have a drink . Drinking does n’t solve problems , Austin . It creates them . ”
5281	5285	5286	5286	I	52	“ Your choice . ”
5393	5403	5404	5404	I	52	“ Hey , you want to see something cool ? ”
5407	5421	5404	5404	I	52	“ I ’ve already seen your dick . It ’s not that interesting . ”
5422	5434	5435	5435	She	47	“ That ’s a lie , and we both know it . ”
5440	5458	5459	5459	I	52	“ Look , I ’d be happy to give you another look if you do n’t remember , ”
5470	5473	5474	5474	she	47	“ Austin ! ”
5482	5487	5474	5474	she	47	“ Cut it out . ”
5488	5498	5474	5474	she	47	“ Come on . Let me show you something . ”
5499	5511	5512	5512	She	47	“ I really do not want to go anywhere with you . ”
5523	5532	5512	5512	She	47	“ Christ , just trust me , Jules . ”
5533	5538	5539	5539	She	47	“ I do n’t . ”
5556	5559	5560	5560	She	47	“ Jules … ”
5564	5592	5560	5560	She	47	“ Stop calling me that . You know I do n’t like it . It ’s Julia . You can call me Julia , like everyone else . ”
5593	5598	5599	5599	I	52	“ Fine . Julia . ”
5638	5648	5649	5649	She	47	“ I thought you ’d like to see this . ”
5696	5706	5686	5686	her	47	“ Why do you think I ’d like it ? ”
5707	5717	5718	5718	Her	47	“ You ’ll know it when you see it . ”
5733	5740	5725	5725	she	47	“ All right . Where to ? ”
5753	5762	5747	5747	she	47	“ Follow me . It ’s almost time . ”
5999	6006	6007	6007	I	52	“ Where are we going again ? ”
6010	6016	6017	6017	He	52	“ I did n’t say . ”
6144	6152	6153	6153	I	52	“ Um … what are you doing ? ”
6156	6162	6153	6153	I	52	“ Going for a drive . ”
6163	6174	6175	6175	His	1111	“ You are not fucking driving ! You ’re drunk . ”
6182	6191	6192	6192	He	1111	“ I ’m not driving . You are . ”
6208	6227	6192	6192	He	1111	“ You want me to drive this huge truck ? Does Jensen even know we ’re borrowing it ? ”
6228	6242	6243	6243	He	1111	“ Eh , do n’t worry about him . He wo n’t care . ”
6251	6256	6243	6243	He	1111	“ Need a boost ? ”
6257	6278	6192	6192	He	1111	“ I do n’t want to steal his car , Austin . Grand theft auto is n’t in my repertoire . ”
6279	6287	6288	6288	he	1111	“ You want me to drive then ? ”
6306	6310	6296	6296	I	52	“ Definitely no . ”
6311	6321	6322	6322	Austin	52	“ Then , get your ass in the truck . ”
6419	6422	6423	6423	I	52	“ Austin , ”
6433	6436	6423	6423	I	52	“ Hmm ? ”
6437	6455	6456	6456	He	1111	“ If you ever touch me again without permission , I ’ll gut you like a fish . ”
6467	6473	6456	6456	He	1111	“ Sure thing , Jules . ”
6490	6497	6456	6456	He	1111	“ Why am I doing this ? ”
6498	6510	6511	6511	Austin	52	“ Because you ’re intrigued . Now , let ’s go . ”
6561	6569	6570	6570	I	52	“ Do n’t make me regret this , ”
6742	6746	6747	6747	he	52	“ Right here , ”
6750	6767	6747	6747	he	52	“ Now , turn it around and back up to the edge of the cliff side . ”
6768	6774	6747	6747	he	52	“ Uh … how close ? ”
6775	6784	6785	6785	He	52	“ I ’ll tell you when to stop . ”
6803	6813	6814	6814	he	52	“ It ’s fine . There ’s a chain , ”
6824	6835	6814	6814	he	52	“ A chain is n’t going to stop this truck . ”
6836	6844	6845	6845	He	52	“ Ah , come on , babe . ”
6890	6900	6901	6901	I	52	“ This is what you wanted to show me ? ”
6936	6940	6925	6925	He	52	“ Over here . ”
6952	6958	6959	6959	He	52	“ What are we doing ? ”
7206	7209	7210	7210	I	52	“ Wow , ”
7213	7220	7210	7210	I	52	“ It ’s a great view . ”
7221	7231	7232	7232	His	52	“ See ? I thought you ’d like it . ”
7247	7254	7210	7210	I	52	“ It ’ll only get better . ”
7255	7262	7263	7263	I	52	“ Why are you like this ? ”
7296	7300	7284	7284	I	52	“ Like what ? ”
7301	7312	7337	7337	he	52	“ Decent when I want nothing to do with you . ”
7313	7336	7337	7337	he	52	“ Hate and love are easy emotions to feel . They ’re powerful . It ’s indifference you have to fight for , ”
7350	7371	7337	7337	he	52	“ Not caring about someone would mean forgetting them , and we both know that neither of us are forgettable . ”
7434	7442	7443	7443	I	52	“ I wish I could forget you , ”
7492	7499	7500	7500	I	52	“ No , you do n’t . ”
7652	7660	7661	7661	Austin	52	“ You have that look about you , ”
7693	7697	7686	7686	he	333	“ What look ? ”
7698	7713	7686	7686	he	333	“ Like you ’re going to draw me like one of your French girls . ”
7714	7727	7686	7686	he	333	“ Ugh ! I regret the day I showed you my drawings . ”
7728	7736	7686	7686	he	333	“ Why ? You ’re an artist . ”
7737	7744	7745	7745	I	52	“ I am not an artist , ”
7752	7783	7745	7745	I	52	“ That ’s reserved for people who , one , have any talent and , two , are professionals . I sometimes draw on the side when the mood strikes . ”
7784	7789	7686	7686	he	333	“ Like right now ? ”
7790	7793	7745	7745	I	52	“ Maybe . ”
7794	7799	7800	7800	he	333	“ I knew it , ”
7805	7814	7815	7815	I	52	“ I thought the sunset would do it . ”
7820	7827	7815	7815	I	52	“ How did you know that ? ”
7828	7834	7835	7835	he	333	“ You like beautiful things , ”
7850	7855	7846	7848	an arrogant jackass	336	“ Whatever , Austin . ”
8073	8076	8077	8077	I	52	“ Jules ? ”
8086	8090	8077	8077	I	52	“ I said — ”
8091	8100	8077	8077	I	52	“ Right . Fuck . Habits , babe . ”
8101	8113	8114	8114	I	52	“ Why the fuck am I even here you with you ? ”
8134	8139	8120	8120	His	333	“ You know why . ”
8140	8145	8146	8146	He	333	“ Honestly , no . ”
8310	8313	8314	8314	I	52	“ Stop , ”
8406	8411	8390	8390	Austin	52	“ What the hell ? ”
8412	8424	8425	8425	I	52	“ Is this the only reason you brought me up here ? ”
8467	8475	8476	8476	he	52	“ So , what if it was ? ”
8479	8485	8476	8476	he	52	“ You seemed plenty willing . ”
8486	8503	8476	8476	he	52	“ Yeah , plenty willing . Even though I told you not to fucking touch me . ”
8504	8513	8476	8476	he	52	“ Right . As if you were serious . ”
8514	8520	8476	8476	he	52	“ Fuck , I was ! ”
8521	8538	8476	8476	he	52	“ Then , why the hell did you come here with me in the first place ? ”
8539	8549	8476	8476	he	52	“ I ’m asking myself the same fucking question . ”
8550	8559	8560	8560	Austin	52	“ Sometimes , you really make no sense , ”
8583	8592	8577	8577	he	52	“ It ’s not hard to respect boundaries . ”
8593	8596	8597	8597	he	52	“ Boundaries ? ”
8605	8618	8597	8597	he	52	“ You have been eye - fucking me since you got here . ”
8619	8629	8630	8630	His	52	“ You ’re mistaking my scowl for sexual attraction . ”
8635	8639	8630	8630	His	52	“ Am I ? ”
8640	8643	8644	8644	I	52	“ Yes . ”
8654	8675	8644	8644	I	52	“ You ’re right . Why the fuck would I think to bring you up to Make - Out Point ? ”
8676	8679	8680	8680	I	52	“ What ? ”
8683	8696	8697	8697	he	52	“ Where did you think we were ? An abandoned parking lot ? ”
8721	8736	8737	8737	I	52	“ After the sun has set , this place will be crawling with teens . ”
8783	8795	8772	8772	He	52	“ You really are disgusting . You know that , right ? ”
8796	8809	8810	8810	Austin	52	“ And here I thought , I was doing you a favor , ”
8820	8828	8810	8810	Austin	52	“ I thought you wanted a rebound . ”
8829	8848	8849	8849	I	52	“ I want nothing to do with you , but thank you for reminding me of that fact , ”
8897	8905	8906	8906	he	52	“ Do n’t storm out of here , ”
8909	8915	8906	8906	he	52	“ Fuck off , Austin . ”
8929	8967	8916	8916	I	52	“ I might want a rebound . Something fun and light and easy . Something to take my mind off of things . But you ’re an idiot if you think that I want that from you . ”
8968	8977	8978	8978	he	52	“ Who do you want it from then ? ”
9003	9006	8988	8988	I	52	“ Patrick . ”
9049	9052	9053	9053	he	1597	“ Patrick , ”
9056	9066	9053	9053	he	1597	“ Yeah . Have something to say about that ? ”
9118	9124	9105	9105	I	52	“ Good luck with that . ”
9125	9138	9155	9155	Christ	67	“ I ’m getting out of here . You drive me crazy . ”
9139	9145	9146	9146	I	52	“ The feeling is mutual . ”
9733	9737	9738	9738	he	1597	“ Quick trip ? ”
9753	9762	9748	9748	He	1597	“ You should probably go get your boy . ”
9780	9788	9748	9748	He	1597	“ He ’s not in the truck ? ”
9789	9797	9798	9798	I	52	“ Does it look like he is ? ”
9831	9842	9843	9843	He	1597	“ Oh , man . Fuck . I needed that . ”
9848	9855	9843	9843	He	1597	“ You actually left him somewhere ? ”
9856	9862	9863	9863	Heidi	594	“ Left who ? Where ? ”
9893	9896	9897	9897	Patrick	1597	“ Austin , ”
9900	9908	9909	9909	I	52	“ Somewhere called Make - Out Point , ”
9919	9924	9913	9913	Heidi	594	“ He did n’t . ”
9925	9931	9932	9932	I	52	“ Oh , he did , ”
9935	9945	9946	9946	Patrick	1597	“ I guess I ’d better go get him , ”
9955	9958	9946	9946	Patrick	1597	“ Idiot . ”
9959	9966	9969	9969	I	52	“ You can say that again . ”
10049	10056	10035	10035	Heidi	594	“ Want to talk about it ? ”
10057	10060	10061	10061	I	52	“ No , ”
10070	10085	10061	10061	I	52	“ This was a mistake . I did n’t mean for this to happen . ”
10086	10113	10061	10061	I	52	“ This is not your fault . This is Austin fucking Wright thinking that , just because I ’m single , I want to fuck him . ”
10114	10118	10119	10119	Heidi	594	“ Do you ? ”
10138	10141	10122	10122	I	52	“ No ! ”
10142	10148	10149	10149	I	52	“ Not even a little ? ”
10193	10198	10182	10182	I	52	“ Maybe a little . ”
10199	10209	10182	10182	I	52	“ Yeah . You two have this … thing . ”
10210	10214	10215	10215	Heidi	594	“ What thing ? ”
10218	10237	10215	10215	Heidi	594	“ I do n’t know . It ’s like the air gets thicker when you two are together . ”
10238	10244	10182	10182	I	52	“ The air gets thicker ? ”
10245	10252	10253	10253	She	594	“ You know what I mean . ”
10260	10289	10253	10253	She	594	“ You two have chemistry . It ’s hard to ignore . But that does n’t mean he ’s for you if you do n’t want that chemistry . ”
10290	10294	10295	10295	I	52	“ I want … ”
10306	10311	10312	10312	Heidi	594	“ Nice and normal ? ”
10315	10323	10312	10312	Heidi	594	“ Like that worked out last time . ”
10324	10333	10334	10334	I	52	“ You ’ll find someone . I promise . ”
10347	10355	10356	10356	Heidi	594	“ I told him I wanted Patrick . ”
10363	10371	10356	10356	Heidi	594	“ Now , that ’s just mean . ”
10372	10379	10312	10312	Heidi	594	“ I wanted to be mean . ”
10380	10386	10356	10356	Heidi	594	“ How did he react ? ”
10387	10403	10404	10404	Heidi	594	“ He acted like he did n’t care . He acts like that about everything . ”
10407	10423	10404	10404	Heidi	594	“ Are you ever going to tell me the real reason you two broke up ? ”
10424	10432	10433	10433	I	52	“ Look , I already told you , ”
10440	10490	10433	10433	I	52	“ He used me and then dumped me . I do n’t want to go back to a guy who did that to me . I do n’t ever want to be used . I really do n’t ever want a guy who makes me feel like Austin does . ”
10491	10499	10404	10404	Heidi	594	“ Is n’t that half the fun ? ”
10500	10503	10504	10504	I	52	“ Sure , ”
10512	10561	10563	10563	Austin	1597	“ It ’s loads of fun . And then reality sets in . Austin is like taking a hit of cocaine and riding out the high . You feel fucking fabulous while you ’re on it , but then you hit rock bottom . And it fucking sucks . ”
10564	10567	10568	10568	I	52	“ Fuck ! ”
11028	11034	11010	11010	I	52	“ Took you long enough . ”
11035	11047	11048	11048	Patrick	1597	“ What the fuck have you gotten yourself into this time ? ”
11051	11058	11048	11048	Patrick	1597	“ Nothing . She went crazy . ”
11059	11081	11082	11082	I	52	“ You brought her to a make - out spot , you dipshit . How did you think she ’d react ? ”
11085	11091	11082	11082	I	52	“ She seemed into it . ”
11092	11098	11048	11048	Patrick	1597	“ Until you told her ? ”
11099	11102	11103	11103	Patrick	1597	“ Maybe . ”
11124	11154	11115	11115	he	1597	“ You and me , Austin , we ’re brothers . I get you . But do n’t be stupid about Julia , or she ’ll find someone else . ”
11155	11163	11169	11169	me	52	“ Why ? Did she say something ? ”
11191	11201	11202	11202	Patrick	1597	“ Besides telling me to get you ? No . ”
11210	11213	11202	11202	Patrick	1597	“ Why ? ”
11214	11218	11219	11219	I	52	“ Never mind . ”
11354	11359	11360	11360	she	64	“ Were you driving ? ”
11389	11394	11395	11395	Patrick	1597	“ Uh … yeah ? ”
11410	11418	11419	11419	she	64	“ Are you out of your mind ? ”
11422	11428	11419	11419	she	64	“ You have been drinking ! ”
11429	11435	11436	11436	Patrick	1597	“ Chill out , Mor . ”
11444	11466	11436	11436	Patrick	1597	“ I did n’t drink with dinner , and I was n’t drunk to begin with . It ’s all good . ”
11467	11471	11472	11472	she	64	“ All good ? ”
11481	11502	11472	11472	she	64	“ You were driving down canyon cliffs ! You could have gotten hurt , or worse , hurt someone else . ”
11503	11519	11520	11520	He	1597	“ I appreciate the worry , but as you can see , we ’re fine . ”
11561	11566	11567	11567	she	64	“ Right . Fine , ”
11642	11649	11650	11650	Morgan	64	“ Hey , hey , hey , ”
11658	11678	11650	11650	Morgan	64	“ I ’m fine . Nothing happened . All is well . Feel free to yell at someone else . ”
11679	11689	11690	11690	She	64	“ I was n’t going to yell at you . ”
11699	11709	11690	11690	She	64	“ Family meeting . We were waiting for you . ”
11710	11716	11717	11717	I	52	“ What ’s it about ? ”
11724	11744	11745	11745	I	52	“ You ’ll find out with everyone else . But get ready ; it ’s pretty kick - ass . ”
11751	11761	11762	11762	She	64	“ Oh , good , you ’re not pregnant . ”
11767	11777	11762	11762	She	64	“ Who do you think I am ? Sutton ? ”
11778	11781	11762	11762	She	64	“ Hey ! ”
11791	11796	11762	11762	She	64	“ I heard that . ”
11932	11938	11939	11939	Morgan	64	“ You were supposed to , ”
11942	11954	11955	11955	She	394	“ Y’all can keep being jealous of my awesome fucking life . ”
12013	12020	12021	12021	Morgan	64	“ She ’s got me there , ”
12024	12033	12034	12034	Morgan	64	“ I ’ve got an awesome fucking life . ”
12037	12047	12048	12048	Her	394	“ Yeah , I bet you do , Austin . ”
12158	12166	12167	12167	Sutton	269	“ Is this going to take long ? ”
12170	12176	12177	12177	Jensen	1111	“ Have somewhere to be ? ”
12184	12190	12177	12177	Jensen	1111	“ Besides enjoying my vacation ? ”
12191	12198	12199	12199	Morgan	64	“ You do n’t even work , ”
12203	12217	12218	12218	Sutton	269	“ Um … hello ? I have a one - year - old , ”
12233	12240	12241	12241	Landon	52	“ It wo n’t take long , ”
12244	12254	12255	12255	Morgan	64	“ You do n’t even know what it is , ”
12261	12300	12258	12258	Landon	52	“ We ca n’t all be in the same room together without ripping out each other ’s throats . So , I ’m assuming Jensen is having this meeting for a reason and will get on with it . ”
12319	12329	12330	12330	Sutton	269	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re enabling him , ”
12335	12341	12342	12342	I	52	“ Not you , too , ”
12363	12371	12372	12372	Sutton	269	“ Can the meeting be about that ? ”
12375	12399	12372	12372	Sutton	269	“ I ’m supposed to be the party animal . I ’m the age to constantly be fucked up . You’re … not . ”
12400	12426	12427	12427	Sutton	269	“ Yet you ’re the one with a kid , and I ’m not . Seems to have worked out better for me than you . ”
12432	12463	12427	12427	Sutton	269	“ Austin , I might be little and not give a shit about a lot of stuff , but if you insult me again , I will kick your ass . ”
12464	12467	12468	12468	Jensen	1111	“ Enough , ”
12485	12500	12471	12471	He	1111	“ I love you all , but can we have peace for five minutes ? ”
12555	12561	12562	12562	Jensen	1111	“ Are we all done ? ”
12565	12572	12573	12573	Landon	52	“ Can I ask a question ? ”
12596	12601	12587	12587	Jensen	1111	“ What is it ? ”
12602	12610	12584	12584	his	52	“ Are you and Emery getting married ? ”
12611	12614	12615	12615	Sutton	269	“ Oh ! ”
12621	12634	12615	12615	Sutton	269	“ And babies ? God , please say there will be babies . ”
12635	12641	12642	12642	Morgan	64	“ You are so gross , ”
12648	12658	12642	12642	Morgan	64	“ Look … normal women like babies , Mor ! ”
12659	12677	12615	12615	Sutton	269	“ Thank God I ’m not normal . Everyone else here is baby crazy , except me . ”
12686	12692	12681	12681	I	52	“ Um … me either . ”
12693	12700	12701	12701	Jensen	1111	“ Could we all please stop ? ”
12708	12717	12701	12701	Jensen	1111	“ Emery and I are not getting married . ”
12718	12726	12727	12727	Landon	52	“ This seems like an egregious oversight , ”
12730	12744	12745	12745	Jensen	1111	“ Just because you rush into things does n’t mean that I do , ”
12748	12790	12745	12745	Jensen	1111	“ Marriage and … babies are high on your priority list . I ’ve already done both of those things and … not that I need to explain that to any of you , but Emery and I want to wait . ”
12791	12802	12803	12803	I	52	“ Well , can we cut to the chase then ? ”
12806	12813	12814	12814	Morgan	64	“ Yes . Back on track , ”
12822	12839	12840	12840	Jensen	1111	“ The real reason we ’re here today has nothing to do with my marital status , ”
12843	12857	12840	12840	Jensen	1111	“ It ’s because … I’m stepping down as CEO of Wright Construction . ”
13018	13021	13022	13022	Sutton	269	“ What ? ”
13027	13032	13022	13022	Sutton	269	“ What the fuck ? ”
13033	13040	13041	13041	Landon	52	“ Yeah . What she said , ”
13086	13099	13100	13100	Jensen	1111	“ I know this might come as a shock to you all , ”
13103	13106	13107	13107	I	52	“ Understatement , ”
13110	13218	13107	13107	I	52	“ However , I feel like this is the best move for all of us going forward . As you know , I studied architecture in college and worked in New York for some time , focused on that . It was n’t what … our dad wanted from me , but it was what I loved . After much consideration , I ’ve decided that I should follow my dreams and work in architecture again . I might be good at what I do , but I do n’t love it , like when I was designing and building things . It is n’t the same . ”
13219	13229	13230	13230	Landon	52	“ Wow . That ’s really awesome , Jensen , ”
13233	13238	13239	13239	Sutton	269	“ I love it ! ”
13282	13298	13299	13299	Jensen	1111	“ Am I the only one wondering where the hell we ’ll go from here ? ”
13302	13310	13299	13299	Jensen	1111	“ I ’m sure you ’re not . ”
13311	13325	13326	13326	I	52	“ Okay . Then , where the hell do we go from here ? ”
13344	13355	13356	13356	Jensen	1111	“ I ’ve spoken to the board about my decision , ”
13359	13383	13384	13384	He	52	“ but I wanted to talk to you all about what was happening . You are Wright Construction as much as I am . ”
13402	13420	13384	13384	He	52	“ With that said , I ’ve put Morgan ’s name forward to be our next CEO . ”
13466	13473	13474	13474	Morgan	64	“ The board approved the decision , ”
13509	13513	13503	13503	She	64	“ Hell yes ! ”
13653	13680	13681	13681	Morgan	64	“ I ’m really excited to take on this new challenge . I think it ’s going to be a whole new step for the company , ”
13684	13692	13693	13693	Jensen	1111	“ It ’s going to be great , ”
13706	13745	13696	13696	He	1111	“ Of course , it wo n’t be immediate . There will be a transitional period while we slowly move Morgan into this key role . But this was step one , and we wanted you to know . ”
13746	13756	13757	13757	Landon	52	“ Who is going to take Morgan ’s job ? ”
13837	13848	13849	13849	Jensen	1111	“ We ’re , uh , still working that out , ”
13852	13858	13859	13859	I	52	“ What does that mean ? ”
13862	13880	13859	13859	I	52	“ It means that the board is still in consultation about how to transition Morgan ’s position . ”
13922	13930	13906	13906	Jensen	1111	“ Can we talk somewhere more private ? ”
13931	13934	13935	13935	I	52	“ Sure , ”
13995	14003	14004	14004	I	52	“ What ’s going on , Jensen ? ”
14007	14024	14004	14004	I	52	“ Look , I put your name up to the board to take Morgan ’s job . ”
14025	14028	13970	13970	Jensen	1111	“ Great ! ”
14029	14035	14036	14036	My	52	“ And they declined you . ”
14041	14046	14036	14036	My	52	“ They did what ? ”
14047	14085	14004	14004	I	52	“ I do n’t know how to say this gently , Austin , but they do n’t think you ’d be a suitable replacement for Morgan . You … give off the wrong image for the company . ”
14086	14093	14094	14094	I	52	“ But I ’m a Wright ! ”
14101	14135	14094	14094	I	52	“ I know , I know . Trust me , I pleaded your case . I told them that you would be the right person for the job . I believe in you . ”
14136	14146	14004	14004	I	52	“ And they just did n’t give a fuck . ”
14147	14162	14094	14094	I	52	“ It ’s not that exactly . They worry about your … drinking habits . ”
14163	14171	14172	14172	I	52	“ What about my fucking drinking habits ? ”
14175	14182	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ They think … you are … ”
14198	14206	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ You ’re an alcoholic , man . ”
14207	14228	14004	14004	I	52	“ So , I have a few drinks here and there . It ’s not the end of the world . ”
14229	14254	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ You have a few drinks with breakfast . Legally , I do n’t know how you drive anywhere . You ’re a mess . ”
14255	14261	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ Fuck off , Jensen . ”
14262	14307	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ I ’m serious , Austin . We ’ve all let it slide up until now . But you ’re going to miss out on this if you do n’t sober up . Maybe if you went to rehab to show you were serious — ”
14308	14323	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ Seriously , Jensen , go fuck yourself ! I do n’t need rehab . ”
14324	14336	14183	14183	Jensen	1111	“ I ’m trying to look out for you , Austin . ”
14337	14363	14364	14364	Jensen	1111	“ No , you ’re trying to parent me . But guess what ? Our parents are dead , and you ca n’t replace them . ”
14367	14373	14374	14374	He	1111	“ Come on , man . ”
14386	14396	14381	14381	I	52	“ I do n’t need any of this shit . ”
14917	14923	14924	14924	she	47	“ What are you doing ? ”
14928	14947	14924	14924	she	47	“ I know it ’s a shock , but my world does n’t revolve around you , babe . ”
14948	14954	14924	14924	she	47	“ I did n’t say — ”
14955	14961	14962	14962	I	52	“ Did n’t have to , ”
14965	14978	14962	14962	I	52	“ Jesus Christ , I was n’t trying to argue with you . ”
14979	15000	15001	15001	I	52	“ That ’s a shock . All you seem to do when you open your mouth is yell at me . ”
15032	15041	14962	14962	I	52	“ As if I ’m the only one ! ”
15042	15049	15099	15099	she	449	“ You left me up there . ”
15050	15057	15058	15058	she	449	“ You were being a prick , ”
15067	15077	15058	15058	she	449	“ I ’ll add it to my fucking tally . ”
15078	15084	15085	15085	She	449	“ Do whatever you want . ”
15158	15166	15167	15167	she	449	“ What the hell are you doing ? ”
15170	15181	15167	15167	she	449	“ Sitting down . Is that a fucking crime now ? ”
15182	15204	15205	15205	she	449	“ It is when you do it . I thought I ’d made myself clear when I left you up there , ”
15211	15221	15205	15205	she	449	“ I do n’t want to deal with this . ”
15222	15236	15237	15237	I	52	“ You made yourself clear when you said you were interested in Patrick , ”
15245	15253	15240	15240	She	449	“ I can do whatever I want . ”
15254	15270	15240	15240	She	449	“ Yeah , and I can fuck half of the lake if I want to . ”
15271	15277	15278	15278	she	449	“ Then , do it , ”
15282	15289	15278	15278	she	449	“ See if I fucking care ! ”
15389	15397	15398	15398	she	449	“ Stop looking at me like that , ”
15409	15413	15401	15401	Her	449	“ Like what ? ”
15418	15428	15414	15414	I	52	“ Like you ’re going to kiss me again . ”
15429	15439	15440	15440	She	449	“ Going to do more than that , Jules . ”
15450	15493	15440	15440	She	449	“ What ’s going on with you ? You ’re hot and cold and then hot again . I ca n’t get a read on you . I thought you wanted a fight , and now , you ’re wanting to fuck . ”
15494	15502	15503	15503	I	52	“ Two things we ’re best at , ”
15510	15521	15522	15522	she	449	“ Well … I do n’t want to do either , ”
15531	15558	15522	15522	she	449	“ If there ’s something going on , you can tell me . Otherwise … I’m going to go back in . It ’s getting cold . ”
15619	15624	15625	15625	She	449	“ There ’s nothing . ”
15940	15952	15953	15953	Heidi	594	“ Did you get the memo that was just sent over ? ”
15963	15966	15953	15953	Heidi	594	“ Uh … ”
15978	15985	15986	15986	Heidi	594	“ I do n’t have anything . ”
16000	16006	15986	15986	Heidi	594	“ It should be there . ”
16097	16114	16115	16115	I	52	“ Meeting upstairs for the whole company at three o’clock ? Attendance mandatory for all staff ? ”
16159	16165	16147	16147	I	52	“ What ’s this about ? ”
16166	16187	16147	16147	I	52	“ It ’s super exciting . I ca n’t believe I was able to hold in this secret all week . ”
16188	16198	16199	16199	I	52	“ You did n’t even share it with me , ”
16205	16215	16199	16199	I	52	“ I know . I ’m legit the worst . ”
16216	16236	16237	16237	Heidi	594	“ Indeed . If you ’re not going to tell me , get the hell out of my office . ”
16242	16255	16256	16256	I	52	“ Are you still on for the First Friday Art Trail tonight ? ”
16259	16271	16256	16256	I	52	“ It sounds awesome . How have I never been before ? ”
16272	16281	16256	16256	I	52	“ You lack culture . That ’s obvious . ”
16282	16288	16289	16289	I	52	“ That ’s clearly it . ”
16301	16306	16307	16307	She	594	“ Out , Martin . ”
16315	16326	16307	16307	She	594	“ All right , but meet me for the meeting . ”
16327	16330	16331	16331	I	52	“ Done . ”
16790	16797	16798	16798	Heidi	594	“ So … you and Austin ? ”
16808	16811	16798	16798	Heidi	594	“ No . ”
16812	16824	16777	16777	Austin	1597	“ Are we going to go stand with him and Patrick ? ”
16825	16828	16798	16798	Heidi	594	“ Nope . ”
16829	16835	16798	16798	Heidi	594	“ Oh , come on . ”
16836	16841	16842	16842	I	52	“ Trevor could see , ”
16846	16865	16866	16866	I	52	“ And so what ? You broke up , and you ’re not interested in Austin . Right ? ”
16882	16887	16874	16874	I	52	“ Heidi , no , ”
16995	16998	16999	16999	Patrick	1597	“ Babes , ”
17002	17005	17006	17006	I	52	“ Hey , ”
17102	17105	17106	17106	he	1597	“ Jules , ”
17135	17144	17145	17145	Patrick	1597	“ You ’re looking good today , Julia , ”
17179	17183	17184	17184	I	52	“ Thank you , ”
17195	17205	17189	17189	Heidi	594	“ Anyone going to say how nice I look ? ”
17206	17211	17212	17212	Patrick	1597	“ Uh , Landon ? ”
17215	17242	17212	17212	Patrick	1597	“ Last time I told him you were hot , he threw me into someone else ’s truck . I ’ll stay on his good side . ”
17243	17248	17249	17249	Heidi	594	“ He did what ? ”
17255	17275	17252	17252	Austin	1597	“ I do n’t think that was actually what happened . Or at least … you said something worse . ”
17276	17287	17212	17212	Patrick	1597	“ What the hell ? He never told me that ! ”
17288	17295	17296	17296	Patrick	1597	“ I bet he did n’t , ”
17299	17306	17296	17296	Patrick	1597	“ Y’all were n’t dating yet . ”
17355	17367	17368	17368	I	52	“ So … do you know what this meeting is about ? ”
17371	17377	17378	17378	His	1597	“ Heidi would n’t say . ”
17393	17396	17378	17378	His	1597	“ Yeah . ”
17397	17401	17378	17378	His	1597	“ Not good ? ”
17402	17419	17378	17378	His	1597	“ No . I mean , yes . It ’s a good thing . Smart decision . ”
17420	17428	17378	17378	His	1597	“ But you do n’t like it ? ”
17429	17434	17435	17435	he	1597	“ Do you care ? ”
17438	17443	17444	17444	I	52	“ Just making conversation , ”
17448	17460	17461	17461	He	1597	“ Why do you always have to make it an argument ? ”
17464	17476	17477	17477	I	52	“ I like the way it makes you flush all over . ”
17534	17542	17543	17543	he	1597	“ Unless that ’s what you want , ”
17552	17557	17543	17543	he	1597	“ I do n’t , ”
17578	17600	17563	17563	He	1597	“ I know every one of your tells , Jules . Say whatever you like , but I know the truth . ”
17675	17687	17688	17688	Heidi	594	“ Oh , look , Jensen is on the stage now , ”
17698	17704	17688	17688	Heidi	594	“ Come on , Julia . ”
17749	17759	17760	17760	Jensen	1111	“ Thanks so much for joining me here today , ”
17783	17820	17766	17766	He	1597	“ I ’m sure you ’re all wondering why I asked you to be here today . It ’s not every day that I ’m letting you all out of work early on a Friday afternoon . ”
17850	17890	17846	17846	I	52	“ I ’ll try to keep this whole thing short . I know everyone would rather get their weekend started . So , there are three main things on the agenda . I ’ll start with the good news . ”
17973	18039	17962	17962	I	52	“ The good news is … we got the new Disney contract for Walt Disney World ! Construction starts next summer , so we have our work cut out for us . But I know that , the last time we had a major project like this , we all knocked it out of the park . I ’ll expect nothing less this time around . ”
18040	18043	18044	18044	Heidi	594	“ Plus , ”
18049	18065	18044	18044	Heidi	594	“ Disney perks ! I bet we ’ll be able to get some discounted tickets . ”
18066	18072	18073	18073	I	52	“ I ’ve never been , ”
18085	18098	18099	18099	I	52	“ You ’ve never been to the most magical place on earth ? ”
18102	18105	18099	18099	I	52	“ Nope . ”
18106	18117	18119	18122	a friend like Heidi	487	“ Uh … we’re going to have to fix that . ”
18206	18233	18234	18234	Jensen	1111	“ But the main reason that I brought you here was because I wanted to announce that I ’m stepping down as CEO of Wright Construction , ”
18241	18244	18245	18245	Heidi	594	“ What ? ”
18257	18262	18245	18245	Heidi	594	“ What is happening ? ”
18268	18296	18297	18297	He	1111	“ This was a very hard decision to make , but after careful consideration , I have decided to follow my passion and move back into architecture . ”
18324	18348	18322	18322	Wright	52	“ And , without further ado , I would like to introduce you to your new CEO , my sister , Morgan Wright . ”
18439	18446	18447	18447	Morgan	64	“ Thank you all so much , ”
18458	18507	18508	18508	She	594	“ I ’m deeply honored to move up as the CEO of this company that I have loved my entire life . I know that it will be a big change for everyone , including me . I hope to be able to fill my brother ’s shoes . ”
18511	18522	18523	18523	I	52	“ Who am I kidding ? His feet are huge . ”
18554	18606	18549	18549	I	52	“ My spot as the CFO will be vacant at the present time as we work with the board to find a suitable replacement . In the meantime , we ’ll have an open search to try to bring in someone new and fresh to take this company into the future . ”
18945	18955	18956	18956	Heidi	594	“ I really , really wanted to tell you , ”
19069	19074	19075	19075	I	52	“ It ’s fine , ”
19078	19089	19075	19075	I	52	“ I can not believe that Jensen is stepping down . ”
19090	19096	19097	19097	Emery	269	“ I ’m so glad , ”
19127	19135	19136	19136	Heidi	594	“ Oh , look , you match , ”
19145	19151	19136	19136	Heidi	594	“ I ’m so shocked . ”
19152	19157	19158	19158	Emery	269	“ Okay , Barbie , ”
19218	19225	19226	19226	Heidi	594	“ Oh , do it again . ”
19238	19244	19235	19235	Emery	269	“ I love your face . ”
19245	19250	19235	19235	Emery	269	“ And my ass ? ”
19251	19255	19256	19256	I	52	“ What ass ? ”
19262	19271	19272	19272	Heidi	594	“ Do n’t be jealous of my ass , ”
19275	19282	19283	19283	Emery	269	“ Oh , she ’s not , ”
19286	19292	19283	19283	Emery	269	“ Julia has it all . ”
19293	19305	19306	19306	Heidi	594	“ Anyway , like I was saying before I was interrupted , ”
19313	19329	19306	19306	Heidi	594	“ Morgan is so up for the task , and this will make Jensen happy . ”
19330	19335	19336	19336	Emery	269	“ So much happier , ”
19339	19352	19353	19353	I	52	“ Right … but why do n’t they have a CFO already ? ”
19378	19386	19387	19387	Emery	269	“ It ’s not really our place , ”
19391	19397	19398	19398	Heidi	594	“ It ’s stupid really , ”
19401	19409	19398	19398	Heidi	594	“ They just want a broad search . ”
19444	19447	19448	19448	I	52	“ Okay , ”
19461	19469	19448	19448	I	52	“ Are we ready to go then ? ”
19470	19473	19474	19474	Heidi	594	“ Yep ! ”
19477	19487	19474	19474	Heidi	594	“ We ’re picking Morgan up along the way ? ”
19488	19492	19493	19493	Emery	269	“ We are ? ”
19496	19520	19493	19493	Emery	269	“ Oh , did n’t I tell you ? I invited her to have girls ’ night with us to celebrate her promotion . ”
19521	19529	19530	19530	I	52	“ So , we ’re a foursome , ”
19540	19547	19533	19533	Emery	269	“ Now , you ’re talking . ”
19635	19640	19625	19625	Morgan	64	“ Hey , Julia . ”
19641	19644	19645	19645	I	52	“ Morgan , ”
19652	19661	19662	19662	Morgan	64	“ Thanks for inviting me , y’ all , ”
19750	19761	19762	19762	Heidi	594	“ We ’re super glad to have you with us , ”
19765	19778	19762	19762	Heidi	594	“ Now , let ’s go hit up food trucks and wine . ”
19779	19782	19783	19783	Emery	269	“ Wine ! ”
19786	19795	19796	19796	I	52	“ Is there actually art to look at ? ”
19806	19818	19799	19799	Morgan	64	“ Have you never been to a First Friday Art Trail ? ”
19819	19822	19799	19799	Morgan	64	“ Nope . ”
19823	19830	19831	19831	Morgan	64	“ Plenty of art to see , ”
19835	19842	19831	19831	Morgan	64	“ But , first , wine . ”
19843	19853	19854	19854	Heidi	594	“ That should be on a T - shirt , ”
19857	19864	19854	19854	Heidi	594	“ But , first , wine . ”
19865	19873	19874	19874	Emery	269	“ And they all said , Amen , ”
20237	20245	20246	20246	I	52	“ I think I need another wine , ”
20262	20271	20255	20255	She	64	“ Same . I ’ll walk with you . ”
20312	20319	20320	20320	Morgan	64	“ That was a cool exhibit , ”
20323	20333	20320	20320	Morgan	64	“ I ’d never seen anything like that before . ”
20334	20358	20320	20320	Morgan	64	“ Me either . I do n’t have a green thumb whatsoever . I ’m pretty sure I would kill every plant imaginable . ”
20359	20365	20320	20320	Morgan	64	“ You and me both . ”
20366	20375	20378	20378	Morgan	64	“ Are you excited about your new job ? ”
20400	20414	20415	20415	I	52	“ I ’m ready to take over the world . It ’s time . ”
20418	20427	20415	20415	I	52	“ What are we doing tonight , Brain ? ”
20428	20437	20438	20438	Morgan	64	“ The same thing we do every night , ”
20444	20448	20449	20449	I	52	“ Drink wine ? ”
20452	20468	20449	20449	I	52	“ Hell yes . I deserve some celebratory drinks . Like , ten at least . ”
20469	20479	20449	20449	I	52	“ Are you going to be able to stand ? ”
20480	20487	20449	20449	I	52	“ God , I hope not . ”
20559	20567	20568	20568	Morgan	64	“ We should do this more often , ”
20571	20584	20568	20568	Morgan	64	“ How do you feel about trashy magazines and bad reality TV ? ”
20585	20591	20610	20610	she	64	“ Um … guilty pleasure ? ”
20592	20609	20610	20610	she	64	“ Great . We ’re going to be best friends . Can we get matching tattoos ? ”
20627	20640	20641	20641	She	64	“ I ’m covered in tattoos . I ’ll hold your hand . ”
20649	20661	20641	20641	She	64	“ How do you know I do n’t already have one ? ”
20662	20665	20666	20666	We	539	“ Touché . ”
20724	20729	20730	20730	Patrick	1597	“ Morgan ! Whoop ! ”
20771	20783	20784	20784	Morgan	64	“ I ’m not a dog . Stop whistling at me , ”
20797	20810	20787	20787	Patrick	1597	“ Ah , Mor , come on . Have a little fun . ”
20811	20814	20815	20815	I	52	“ Hey , ”
20831	20834	20835	20835	He	52	“ Hey . ”
20938	20941	20942	20942	Patrick	1597	“ So , ”
20950	20961	20942	20942	Patrick	1597	“ y’ all coming to Louie Louie ’s with us ? ”
20962	20967	20968	20968	Morgan	64	“ Dueling piano bar ? ”
20971	20976	20968	20968	Morgan	64	“ I ’m in . ”
20977	20980	20981	20981	Austin	52	“ Jules ? ”
20993	21008	20984	20984	I	52	“ We ’re with Heidi and Em . We ’ll have to ask them . ”
21009	21014	21015	21015	Morgan	64	“ They ’re in ! ”
21018	21027	21015	21015	Morgan	64	“ Heidi already promised to get me wasted . ”
21028	21041	21042	21042	Patrick	1597	“ You ’re getting wasted , and you did n’t call me ? ”
21148	21151	21152	21152	Austin	52	“ Cool , ”
21155	21163	21152	21152	Austin	52	“ We ’ll see you there then . ”
21164	21178	21179	21179	Patrick	1597	“ Let ’s snag Mini Wright and our resident tatted up HR girl , ”
21189	21199	21182	21182	Morgan	64	“ and have the Wright wifeys meet us there . ”
21200	21208	21209	21209	I	52	“ We ’ve barely seen anything yet , ”
21245	21264	21265	21265	Austin	52	“ I ’ll walk the exhibits with you if y’ all want to head to the bar early , ”
21284	21291	21277	21277	he	1597	“ You ’re skipping the bar ? ”
21292	21300	21301	21301	he	1597	“ I ’m meeting you there later , ”
21310	21323	21304	21304	He	1597	“ It ’s not like this whole place is n’t open container . ”
21330	21358	21359	21359	She	544	“ All right , all right . We ’ll save a table . Get the wifeys and meet us there . You up for that , Mor ? ”
21363	21379	21359	21359	She	544	“ I want to be thoroughly trashed by the time they meet up with us . ”
21380	21384	21385	21385	Patrick	1597	“ Challenge accepted , ”
21395	21401	21388	21388	Austin	1597	“ Hands off my sister . ”
21468	21471	21474	21474	Patrick	1597	“ Dude , ”
21482	21490	21491	21491	I	52	“ Dear God , he is oblivious , ”
21494	21500	21491	21491	I	52	“ Tell me about it . ”
21501	21515	21474	21474	Patrick	1597	“ Oh my God , did we just have a conversation without arguing ? ”
21516	21522	21523	21523	he	1597	“ You look fucking hot , ”
21539	21545	21528	21528	I	52	“ You ’re a pig . ”
21546	21600	21601	21601	I	52	“ Really ? Because I think I just got you more time to look at all the art you ’re dying to see . Otherwise , you would have been dragged away to see drunks singing Bon Jovi and Journey at the tops of their lungs . A simple thank you would suffice . ”
21637	21640	21641	21641	I	52	“ Fine , ”
21646	21649	21650	21650	he	1597	“ Fine , ”
21659	21668	21650	21650	he	1597	“ Let me tell Heidi and Emery first . ”
21724	21731	21732	21732	Austin	1597	“ This one is my favorite , ”
21735	21743	21744	21744	He	1597	“ This one has been here before ? ”
21747	21752	21744	21744	He	1597	“ Once or twice . ”
21959	21965	21966	21966	I	52	“ They ’re foster kids ? ”
21984	22032	22033	22033	He	1597	“ They ’re supposed to draw something that inspires them . I hate that there are so many kids in Lubbock without a forever home , but I ’m glad we have programs like this that help kids in need by getting donations from the local community . ”
22334	22337	22329	22329	I	52	“ What ? ”
22365	22369	22363	22363	me	52	“ Just you . ”
22370	22373	22374	22374	I	52	“ Me ? ”
22408	22418	22419	22419	Patrick	1597	“ Can you two make out already or something ? ”
22425	22428	22419	22419	Patrick	1597	“ Right ? ”
22455	22466	22467	22467	Heidi	594	“ Yes . Make out . Everyone should make out . ”
22476	22481	22467	22467	Heidi	594	“ You all right ? ”
22482	22494	22495	22495	she	64	“ I ’m amazing ! Dream job , here I come ! ”
22508	22518	22519	22519	Emery	269	“ How much did you get her to drink ? ”
22525	22541	22522	22522	Patrick	1597	“ We did a couple of shots . She was fine before you got here . ”
22542	22548	22549	22549	Morgan	64	“ We did eight shots ! ”
22552	22559	22560	22560	Julia	47	“ I ’m great at counting . ”
22570	22576	22577	22577	I	52	“ CEO material right there , ”
22623	22628	22629	22629	Morgan	64	“ Oh my God ! ”
22632	22638	22629	22629	Morgan	64	“ I love this song ! ”
22658	22663	22644	22644	she	64	“Baby One More Time . ”
22797	22806	22807	22807	I	52	“ You want to go out with me ? ”
22833	22836	22823	22823	She	47	“ What ? ”
22837	22871	22872	22872	She	47	“ A date . You , me , together . I ’ll pick you up . We ’ll do normal human things instead of running into each other over and over on accident . ”
22896	22904	22905	22905	she	47	“ Are you out of your mind ? ”
22911	22918	22905	22905	she	47	“ Not that I know of . ”
22919	22922	22923	22923	she	47	“ Austin , ”
22926	22940	22923	22923	she	47	“ We tried this . We broke up . We ’re awful together . ”
22941	22947	22948	22948	She	47	“ Maybe things have changed . ”
22951	22956	22948	22948	She	47	“ They have n’t . ”
22957	22967	22923	22923	she	47	“ Sometimes , I really do n’t get you . ”
22968	22971	22972	22972	she	47	“ Sometimes ? ”
22990	23025	22978	22978	She	47	“ I ’m pretty sure you never got me . Ever ! If you understood me at all , then we would n’t have gone through the shit we went through two years ago . ”
23052	23107	23041	23041	she	47	“ I do get you , Jules . I get you better than anyone you ’ve ever met . I see you . I know you . And that ’s why this did n’t work . You can blame me all you want , but the truth is that you wo n’t open up . ”
23108	23115	23116	23116	Her	47	“ I wo n’t open up ? ”
23123	23139	23116	23116	Her	47	“ You think that ’s the reason ? So , you ’re blind and stupid . ”
23140	23161	23162	23162	I	52	“ I think that you ’d rather have someone safe in your back pocket than have someone who challenges you . ”
23184	23257	23258	23258	She	47	“ And you think that you ’re a bright ray of sunshine ? You ’re completely open and honest ? What happened Memorial Day weekend , Austin ? Why did n’t you tell me about the CFO position ? You had the opportunity , and you fucking choked . You might think that I ca n’t open up , but if that ’s the truth , then you ’re just as bad . ”
23373	23381	23362	23362	I	52	“ The board did n’t approve me , ”
23407	23411	23412	23412	I	52	“ This fast ? ”
23415	23442	23412	23412	I	52	“ Jensen put my name up for CFO when he moved Morgan up to his job . The board had some … concerns about my behavior . ”
23443	23469	23470	23470	I	52	“ That should n’t be reason enough not to give you the job . You ’re a Wright . Maybe they ’ll change their minds . ”
23486	23512	23513	23513	Julia	47	“ No . Jensen accused me of being an alcoholic and said that I had to go to rehab before they ’d even consider it . ”
23582	23590	23591	23591	Julia	47	“ Maybe you should listen to him , ”
23648	23657	23658	23658	she	47	“ Why the hell did you storm off ? ”
23678	23689	23661	23661	She	47	“ Why the hell are you following me , Jules ? ”
23784	23793	23775	23775	I	52	“ You just up and left without explanation . ”
23812	23823	23824	23824	I	52	“ You do n’t want to go out with me , ”
23827	23877	23824	23824	I	52	“ You do n’t want to have anything to do with me . You abandoned me on the top of the canyon a week ago and said that all we did was argue . So , if you do n’t want this , then leave me the fuck alone . ”
23878	23898	23899	23899	she	47	“ Excuse me for trying to find out why you ’re not getting a job I think you deserve , ”
23905	23912	23899	23899	she	47	“ I guess I was wrong . ”
23913	23923	23924	23924	She	47	“ What I deserve has never mattered to anyone . ”
24006	24015	24016	24016	I	52	“ Oh , I ’ve missed that look , ”
24029	24033	24034	24034	Her	47	“ What look ? ”
24054	24063	24064	24064	I	52	“ The one begging me to fuck you . ”
24072	24083	24084	24084	She	47	“ Do you want me to fuck you , Jules ? ”
24096	24099	24100	24100	she	47	“ No , ”
24106	24110	24111	24111	She	47	“ You sure ? ”
24114	24117	24111	24111	She	47	“ No . ”
24118	24128	24084	24084	She	47	“ That ’s right . I know you do . ”
24129	24138	24139	24139	she	47	“ You do n’t know anything about me , ”
24142	24162	24163	24163	Julia	47	“ I know that your body is craving mine , like an addict in need of her next fix . ”
24166	24178	24163	24163	Julia	47	“ You ’d know all about that , would n’t you ? ”
24179	24186	24187	24187	I	52	“ I do n’t do drugs , ”
24192	24197	24187	24187	I	52	“ And alcohol is … ”
24198	24201	24163	24163	Julia	47	“ Different . ”
24202	24205	24206	24206	she	47	“ Bullshit , ”
24213	24244	24206	24206	she	47	“ You talk about all the other addictions out there — drugs , sex , money — yet you wo n’t own up to your own . It ’s pathetic . ”
24245	24261	24262	24262	I	52	“ What ’s pathetic is that you ’ll use any excuse to argue with me . ”
24273	24282	24262	24262	I	52	“ Any excuse to put distance between us . ”
24283	24290	24206	24206	she	47	“ Sex was never our problem ! ”
24291	24301	24262	24262	I	52	“ Then , why are n’t we having it ? ”
24302	24309	24310	24310	she	47	“ Because you are the problem , ”
24319	24325	24310	24310	she	47	“ Keep telling yourself that . ”
24360	24368	24369	24369	Julia	47	“ Where the hell are you going ? ”
24374	24384	24369	24369	Julia	47	“ Finding someone who wants to suck my dick , ”
24506	24513	24514	24514	I	52	“ Go on inside , Jules , ”
24517	24527	24514	24514	I	52	“ The life you want is n’t with me . ”
24575	24603	24571	24571	she	47	“ You push everyone in your life away . One day , you ’re going to wake up and realize that you do n’t have anyone left . ”
25017	25022	25008	25008	I	52	“ There you are ! ”
25033	25038	25023	25023	Heidi	594	“ Where were you ? ”
25039	25047	25048	25048	I	52	“ I needed to get some air , ”
25060	25065	25055	25055	She	269	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
25066	25069	25023	25023	Heidi	594	“ Nothing . ”
25070	25076	25055	25055	She	269	“ You have the look . ”
25077	25084	25085	25085	Heidi	594	“ Really , I ’m fine . ”
25090	25097	25085	25085	Heidi	594	“ Um … yeah , right . ”
25098	25112	25055	25055	She	269	“ I ’m tired . I ’m going to go home , okay ? ”
25113	25118	25119	25119	Heidi	594	“ What ? No ! ”
25122	25137	25119	25119	Heidi	594	“ Come on . Come and dance with us . It ’ll be fun ! ”
25138	25144	25145	25145	Emery	269	“ Did Austin do something ? ”
25155	25160	25161	25161	I	52	“ He … yeah . ”
25164	25175	25176	25176	Heidi	594	“ I do n’t know . He asked me out . ”
25179	25185	25176	25176	Heidi	594	“ That ’s so exciting ! ”
25186	25211	25222	25222	She	594	“ No . I told him no . Then , he told me about the CFO position , and we got into another argument . ”
25212	25218	25219	25219	Emery	269	“ You told him no ? ”
25239	25251	25252	25252	Heidi	594	“ Yeah . I do n’t want to date him again . ”
25255	25265	25252	25252	Heidi	594	“ In what universe is that statement actually true ? ”
25266	25295	25308	25308	Heidi	594	“ He told me he was going to find someone else to suck his dick ! I think I ’m justified in saying that I ’m not interested . ”
25296	25307	25308	25308	Heidi	594	“ He said that because you ’d turned him down , ”
25316	25329	25308	25308	Heidi	594	“ Well , if he wants someone else , by all means . ”
25349	25366	25338	25338	Emery	269	“ Loving a Wright is n’t easy . I ca n’t imagine Austin is any different . ”
25367	25374	25308	25308	Heidi	594	“ I do not love Austin ! ”
25375	25380	25381	25381	Emery	269	“ I was n’t … ”
25386	25455	25381	25381	Emery	269	“ That ’s not what I meant . Simply that , if Austin got up the nerve to ask you out after your breakup , after you slapping him in the face last fall , and after you abandoning him on top of the canyon last weekend … he must be into you . No guy puts up with that much shit and sticks around for no reason . ”
25456	25464	25465	25465	I	52	“ Oh , there ’s a reason , ”
25468	25477	25465	25465	I	52	“ He wants to have sex with me . ”
25478	25487	25488	25488	Heidi	594	“ No guy works that hard for pussy , ”
25491	25498	25499	25499	I	52	“ What about really good pussy ? ”
25508	25523	25502	25502	Emery	269	“ Jensen and Landon both jumped through hoops . Wright men love the chase . ”
25524	25538	25539	25539	I	52	“ So , what ? You think I should give him a chance ? ”
25543	25551	25539	25539	I	52	“ After what he put me through ? ”
25552	25563	25564	25564	Heidi	594	“ Well , we do n’t know what actually happened , ”
25607	25618	25619	25619	I	52	“ It does n’t matter . It ’s ancient history , ”
25622	25626	25627	25627	Emery	269	“ All right , ”
25642	25653	25654	25654	I	52	“ Then , yeah … maybe give him another chance . ”
25673	25684	25685	25685	I	52	“ Is this what it ’s like to have girlfriends ? ”
25688	25709	25710	25710	Heidi	594	“ We give you sage advice , and you listen to us wise women who have been where you stand ? ”
25716	25724	25710	25710	Heidi	594	“ Yes , yes , it is . ”
25725	25732	25733	25733	Emery	269	“ Do n’t listen to her , ”
25736	25764	25733	25733	Emery	269	“ Girlfriends are here to cheer you on and commiserate when shit goes down . Also , for Buffy marathons , ice cream dates , and shopping . ”
25765	25780	25781	25781	Heidi	594	“ You mean , force - feeding all my friends colors in their wardrobes ? ”
26301	26322	26294	26294	Heidi	594	“ I still ca n’t get over the fact that Landon used to live here in a tiny one bedroom . ”
26323	26342	26343	26343	Emery	269	“ That does seem crazy , considering where he lives now and the place he had in Clearwater , ”
26346	26357	26358	26358	I	52	“ I ’m glad I opted for the two bedroom , ”
26370	26389	26358	26358	I	52	“ I took one look at the one bedroom and decided I could n’t live in a shoebox . ”
26390	26401	26402	26402	Heidi	594	“ Hey , did you leave your car door open ? ”
26407	26421	26402	26402	Heidi	594	“ My what ? No , why would I leave my door open ? ”
26422	26433	26358	26358	I	52	“ I do n’t know , but it ’s open . ”
26434	26437	26438	26438	I	52	“ Fuck ! ”
26472	26480	26481	26481	she	594	“ Is the window broken or anything ? ”
26500	26507	26495	26495	I	52	“ All the windows are fine . ”
26736	26741	26742	26742	Emery	269	“ Is anything missing ? ”
26749	26757	26742	26742	Emery	269	“ No . Not even my headphones . ”
26758	26763	26764	26764	Heidi	594	“ That ’s lucky , ”
26767	26776	26777	26777	Emery	269	“ Maybe you just left the door open , ”
26780	26785	26777	26777	Emery	269	“ It could happen . ”
26786	26795	26796	26796	Heidi	594	“ Yeah . You were in a hurry , ”
26897	26904	26905	26905	I	52	“ False alarm , I guess , ”
27070	27073	27074	27074	I	52	“ Fuck , ”
27308	27320	27297	27297	she	622	“ Austin , Christ , do n’t scare me like that ! ”
27321	27328	27301	27301	Her	622	“ Uh … hey , Mindi . ”
27329	27336	27297	27297	she	622	“ Babe , you look horrible . ”
27337	27340	27341	27341	I	52	“ Thanks , ”
27435	27452	27453	27453	My	52	“ Uh … what the hell am I doing here ? And … is Maggie around ? ”
27462	27480	27481	27481	Mindi	99	“ She ’s out of town , but I figured she ’d appreciate me saving your life , ”
27491	27497	27481	27481	Mindi	99	“ Do you want some ? ”
27509	27520	27521	27521	Mindi	99	“ Like , what do you remember about last night ? ”
27524	27537	27538	27538	I	52	“ Nothing . It ’s a blur . Did we hook up ? ”
27547	27550	27544	27544	She	99	“ Ew . ”
27551	27560	27521	27521	Mindi	99	“ You ’re so good for the ego . ”
27561	27588	27589	27589	She	99	“ I mean … I’d be down if you could convince that golfer brother of yours . You know how I am about brothers , Austin . ”
27596	27608	27609	27609	She	99	“ I ’ll take a pass . Landon is engaged anyway . ”
27616	27626	27609	27609	She	99	“ Shame . Mags would probably gut me anyway . ”
27627	27635	27609	27609	She	99	“ So , why am I here ? ”
27636	27696	27697	27697	I	52	“ You were at the bar , talking to this girl . You were going on and on about this other girl , Jules , who you ’re apparently obsessed with . And something about being an alcoholic and the company . I was getting off my shift and saved you from yourself . So , you ’re welcome . ”
27707	27712	27697	27697	I	52	“ Well , thanks . ”
27713	27730	27731	27731	she	626	“ Anytime . Now … if you could put in a word with Patrick for me , ”
27738	27745	27731	27731	she	626	“ that would be really great . ”
28235	28246	28225	28225	Jensen	1111	“ Austin . To what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
28302	28312	28313	28313	I	52	“ I came to talk about the CFO position . ”
28339	28345	28331	28331	Jensen	1111	“ You want the job . ”
28346	28354	28355	28355	I	52	“ Well , of course I do , ”
28358	28361	28362	28362	he	1111	“ Look , ”
28373	28427	28362	28362	he	1111	“ I want to apologize for the conversation that we had over Memorial Day weekend . I was so excited for Morgan and disappointed about what had happened with the board in regard to you . I should n’t have said the things I did . You know I hate when we fight . ”
28431	28443	28444	28444	Jensen	1111	“ Yeah , well , maybe I needed to hear it . ”
28452	28456	28444	28444	Jensen	1111	“ Come again ? ”
28457	28487	28444	28444	Jensen	1111	“ I do n’t know , man . I just think things are n’t going how I expected them . And I did n’t have a drink this morning . ”
28488	28497	28498	28498	I	52	“ When was the last time that happened ? ”
28501	28505	28498	28498	I	52	“ No idea . ”
28506	28525	28444	28444	Jensen	1111	“ All right . So , where do we go from here ? How can I help you ? ”
28526	28538	28539	28539	I	52	“ I do n’t want this to be a big thing , ”
28545	28555	28556	28556	I	52	“ Does this have something to do with Julia ? ”
28561	28568	28556	28556	I	52	“ Why would you think that ? ”
28569	28575	28576	28576	he	1111	“ I live with Emery , ”
28580	28585	28576	28576	he	1111	“ She say something ? ”
28586	28605	28556	28556	I	52	“ She might have mentioned that y’ all ran into each other at the First Friday Art Trail . ”
28606	28627	28556	28556	I	52	“ Yeah , well , Julia wants nothing to do with me . It ’s probably better that way anyway . ”
28628	28636	28637	28637	I	52	“ Who are you trying to convince ? ”
28646	28710	28643	28643	he	1111	“ I ’m here for you , no matter why the sudden change of heart . You know that we all worry about you . The last thing we want is for you to spiral and end up like Dad . I ’d hate to see this damage your health and ruin any chance at a normal relationship with a girl like Julia . ”
28711	28727	28728	28728	I	52	“ You really think I ’m far enough gone that I could be like Dad ? ”
28736	28761	28728	28728	I	52	“ If you ’re talking to me about it right now , then no . And I ’d like it to stay that way . ”
28762	28766	28728	28728	I	52	“ All right . ”
28876	28892	28893	28893	Jensen	1111	“ Austin , I think we should figure out a course of action from here , ”
28903	28922	28896	28896	I	52	“ I think I ’ll just give it a try on my own . See how it goes . ”
28933	28951	28952	28952	Jensen	1111	“ You really think there ’s no chance that the board will look at me for CFO ? ”
28962	28974	28952	28952	Jensen	1111	“ It ’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility . ”
28975	28978	28952	28952	Jensen	1111	“ But ? ”
28979	28992	28952	28952	Jensen	1111	“ But we have already been inundated with applications for the position . ”
28993	29003	29004	29004	Jensen	1111	“ Did n’t you just post it on Friday ? ”
29007	29012	29013	29013	I	52	“ Well , fuck , ”
29016	29020	29013	29013	I	52	“ Anyone good ? ”
29021	29025	29026	29026	he	1111	“ A couple , ”
29029	29045	29026	29026	he	1111	“ I ’ve seen two that I really like — David Calloway and Elizabeth Leyton . ”
29046	29057	29058	29058	I	52	“ David Calloway ? Like , the Silicon Valley guy ? ”
29064	29068	29058	29058	I	52	“ The one . ”
29069	29079	29026	29026	he	1111	“ What the hell does he want with us ? ”
29080	29100	29101	29101	Jensen	1111	“ A Fortune 500 would be a step up for him . He brings a lot to the table , ”
29104	29116	29117	29117	Jensen	1111	“ Shit . Where have I heard of Elizabeth Leyton before ? ”
29120	29134	29117	29117	Jensen	1111	“ I think you slept with her sister in LA that one summer . ”
29135	29145	29026	29026	he	1111	“ I did ? That summer is a blur . ”
29243	29263	29238	29238	I	52	“ Anyway , Elizabeth seems to be the brains of their family . I would n’t count her out . ”
29271	29275	29276	29276	I	52	“ All right , ”
29279	29284	29285	29285	Man	52	“ Well , great . ”
29292	29303	29285	29285	Man	52	“ Austin , we ’ll figure it out . Okay ? ”
29304	29312	29313	29313	I	52	“ Yeah . Sure . Sounds good . ”
29604	29607	29608	29608	she	96	“ Fine , ”
29619	29626	29612	29612	I	52	“ What are you talking about ? ”
29627	29639	29608	29608	she	96	“ Okay , fine . I ’ll go out with you . ”
29640	29644	29645	29645	I	52	“ You will ? ”
29650	29657	29645	29645	I	52	“ Yes . Under one stipulation . ”
29658	29663	29612	29612	I	52	“ What ’s that ? ”
29664	29668	29669	29669	My	52	“ No alcohol . ”
29703	29716	29696	29696	I	52	“ All right . What do you have in mind , Jules ? ”
29725	29731	29732	29732	she	96	“ Fuck if I know , ”
29735	29745	29732	29732	she	96	“ I ’ll figure something out . Friday night ? ”
29746	29749	29750	29750	she	96	“ Fine , ”
29784	29790	29775	29775	she	96	“ What changed your mind ? ”
29791	29798	29799	29799	she	96	“ I really do n’t know , ”
29842	29853	29854	29854	She	96	“ Glad you can admit you want me at least . ”
29857	29864	29854	29854	She	96	“ I did not say that . ”
29865	29879	29880	29880	She	96	“ Do n’t worry , Jules . Your secrets are safe with me . ”
29912	29930	29880	29880	She	96	“ Just pick me up after six thirty because I ’ll be at the range until then . ”
29931	29939	29880	29880	She	96	“ Why do n’t we start there ? ”
29940	29949	29950	29950	she	96	“ Have you ever even fired a gun ? ”
29958	29963	29950	29950	she	96	“ Wait and see . ”
29964	29970	29880	29880	She	96	“ Good luck , Wright . ”
29971	29977	29978	29978	She	96	“ Do n’t need it . ”
30317	30324	30325	30325	Heidi	594	“ Really , just chill out , ”
30340	30358	30331	30331	I	52	“ That ’s easy for you to say . You ’re engaged . Shit all worked out . ”
30359	30379	30380	30380	I	52	“ Yeah , but it was n’t rainbows and fucking unicorns when it all happened . You remember that . ”
30383	30389	30390	30390	Heidi	594	“ Yeah . I do . ”
30393	30428	30429	30429	Heidi	594	“ Look relationships are n’t easy . Especially not with the Wrights . They have actual skeletons in their closets and , sometimes , psycho ex - wives and a legion of devoted fans . ”
30434	30460	30429	30429	Heidi	594	“ Anyway , what I ’m trying to say is , enjoy your time . If he acts like a dick , then ditch him . ”
30461	30469	30470	30470	Heidi	594	“ Sage advice from my bubblegum queen . ”
30475	30486	30470	30470	Heidi	594	“ One day , I will get you into pink . ”
30487	30495	30429	30429	Heidi	594	“ I ’d like to see that . ”
30496	30503	30504	30504	She	594	“ One day , damn it . ”
30513	30542	30504	30504	She	594	“ So , call me after the date to fill me in on the details . Unless , of course , you make it an all - nighter . ”
30543	30546	30547	30547	She	594	“ Heidi ! ”
30553	30567	30547	30547	She	594	“ Then , I expect a report tomorrow or whenever you two surface . ”
30568	30573	30504	30504	She	594	“ You ’re horrible . ”
30574	30587	30504	30504	She	594	“ It ’s not like it ’s the first time . Right ? ”
30588	30596	30547	30547	She	594	“ Well , we ’re starting over . ”
30597	30606	30547	30547	She	594	“ Did you really tell him no alcohol ? ”
30610	30619	30620	30620	She	594	“ You ’re brave . I love you . ”
30979	30984	30985	30985	he	1597	“ Hey , Jules , ”
31045	31048	31049	31049	I	52	“ Hey . ”
31158	31165	31166	31166	he	1597	“ Are you ready for this ? ”
31187	31192	31169	31169	I	52	“ More than ready . ”
31193	31198	31216	31216	His	1597	“ You came prepared . ”
31199	31215	31216	31216	His	1597	“ I ’m here two or three times a week . I ’m always prepared . ”
31220	31230	31216	31216	His	1597	“ I did n’t know you came that often . ”
31231	31244	31169	31169	I	52	“ Well , when we were last together , I did n’t . ”
31245	31253	31254	31254	he	1597	“ What made you change your mind ? ”
31275	31282	31268	31268	I	52	“ Can never be too prepared . ”
31283	31300	31301	31301	My	52	“ Next , you ’re going to tell me that you have a concealed carry permit . ”
31308	31311	31312	31312	he	1597	“ Fuck , ”
31331	31334	31335	31335	Tip	106	“ Julia ! ”
31342	31347	31348	31348	I	52	“ Hey , Tip , ”
31356	31370	31348	31348	I	52	“ Perfect timing , as usual . I have you on six today . ”
31371	31380	31381	31381	I	52	“ I ’ll need one nearby , too , ”
31390	31401	31402	31402	Tip	106	“ No problem . I can put him in seven . ”
31438	31447	31448	31448	Austin	52	“ So , you are here a lot , ”
31451	31455	31448	31448	Austin	52	“ Pretty much . ”
31456	31464	31465	31465	I	52	“ That guy is so into you . ”
31468	31473	31474	31474	Austin	52	“ He so is . ”
31484	31487	31474	31474	Austin	52	“ What ? ”
31488	31495	31448	31448	Austin	52	“ Most girls do n’t notice . ”
31496	31511	31512	31512	Austin	52	“ Good thing I ’m not a girl then . I ’m a woman . ”
31516	31524	31512	31512	Austin	52	“ That is a very good thing . ”
31685	31698	31676	31676	I	52	“ All right , show me what you ’ve got , Wright , ”
31807	31816	31793	31793	He	644	“ I forgot how much fun that is . ”
31817	31823	31824	31824	I	52	“ Adrenaline rush , right ? ”
31841	31847	31838	31838	he	644	“ Your turn , Banner . ”
31974	31984	31969	31969	I	52	“ So , uh , what did you think ? ”
31985	31989	31969	31969	I	52	“ Not bad . ”
31990	31998	31969	31969	I	52	“ Not bad ? Are you joking ? ”
31999	32003	31969	31969	I	52	“ Pretty good . ”
32004	32024	31969	31969	I	52	“ I ’ll show you pretty good when we get our targets back , and I kicked your ass . ”
32025	32029	31969	31969	I	52	“ So competitive . ”
32030	32035	31969	31969	I	52	“ Are n’t you ? ”
32036	32041	32042	32042	he	52	“ Oh , absolutely , ”
32045	32060	31969	31969	I	52	“ But watching you makes me want to get out of here , Jules . ”
32061	32065	32066	32066	I	52	“ Does it ? ”
32080	32086	32070	32070	I	52	“ You know it does . ”
32087	32094	32095	32095	I	52	“ Is that what this is ? ”
32103	32109	32095	32095	I	52	“ Just sex … again ? ”
32110	32113	32114	32114	he	52	“ No , ”
32118	32123	32124	32124	I	52	“ Are you sure ? ”
32132	32162	32163	32163	I	52	“ I ’m here on your terms . You know I want you . But I ’m fucking trying . Why ca n’t I want you without an argument ? ”
32185	32195	32177	32177	I	52	“ It ’s hard after what happened last time . ”
32196	32210	32177	32177	I	52	“ Living in the past is a surefire way to screw this up . ”
32211	32215	32216	32216	I	52	“ I know , ”
32234	32247	32225	32225	I	52	“ Let ’s start over . Hi , I ’m Julia Banner . ”
32264	32268	32256	32256	he	52	“ Austin Wright . ”
32461	32475	32454	32454	Julia	47	“ If you ’re going to make out , do it somewhere else . ”
32484	32487	32488	32488	I	52	“ Sorry , ”
32501	32508	32509	32509	Austin	52	“ We were just leaving anyway , ”
32512	32516	32509	32509	Austin	52	“ We were ? ”
32517	32534	32535	32535	I	52	“ Yeah . Let ’s get out of here . We can come back another day . ”
32540	32552	32535	32535	I	52	“ Already planning a second date ? You ’re very confident . ”
32553	32566	32567	32568	Cocky bastard	684	“ You can pretend to hate that about me if you like . ”
32625	32640	32641	32641	I	52	“ But there are so many other things to pretend to hate about you , ”
32800	32803	32804	32804	Austin	52	“ Luck , ”
32813	32819	32804	32804	Austin	52	“ Ha ! Sore loser ! ”
32820	32839	32804	32804	Austin	52	“ Well , if I was there as often as you , then I ’d be as good . ”
32840	32848	32849	32849	I	52	“ Yeah , but you ’re not . ”
32900	32903	32904	32904	I	52	“ So , ”
32911	32924	32904	32904	I	52	“ where are we off to ? Do I need to change ? ”
32925	32936	32937	32937	He	52	“ Uh , yeah , no . You ’re fine . ”
32950	32953	32937	32937	He	52	“ Right . ”
32954	32964	32965	32965	I	52	“ And where we ’re going is a surprise . ”
32984	32993	32994	32994	Austin	52	“ Let ’s drop your car off first , ”
33002	33013	32994	32994	Austin	52	“ Then , I can drive you around all night . ”
33014	33020	33021	33021	I	52	“ Sure . Sounds good , ”
33260	33265	33266	33266	I	52	“ So … dinner ? ”
33269	33275	33266	33266	I	52	“ I ’m already starving . ”
33276	33288	33266	33266	I	52	“ Shooting takes it out of you , does n’t it ? ”
33289	33298	33266	33266	I	52	“ It ’s like I ran a marathon . ”
33299	33319	33320	33320	I	52	“ Same . That was a total adrenaline rush though . I see why you do it so often . ”
33358	33362	33266	33266	I	52	“ Food then ? ”
33363	33377	33378	33378	I	52	“ Do n’t worry , Jules . I ’ll take care of you . ”
33570	33581	33582	33582	He	46	“ Where the hell are you taking me , Wright ? ”
33585	33596	33582	33582	He	46	“ Well , your stipulations made it a little difficult . ”
33597	33603	33582	33582	He	46	“ I had one stipulation . ”
33604	33615	33582	33582	He	46	“ Sure , but I wanted to do it right . ”
33616	33621	33622	33622	He	46	“ Right or Wright ? ”
33630	33633	33622	33622	He	46	“ Both . ”
33696	33704	33686	33686	I	52	“ I hope you like carnival rides . ”
33705	33712	33713	33713	I	52	“ You are full of surprises , ”
33745	33754	33735	33735	I	52	“ We probably should have brought the Tahoe . ”
33768	33778	33763	33763	he	46	“ I do n’t mind getting a little dirty . ”
33779	33785	33763	33763	he	46	“ You or the car ? ”
33786	33789	33790	33790	I	52	“ Yes . ”
33913	33922	33923	33923	Austin	52	“ What are you in for , Jules ? ”
33926	33930	33923	33923	Austin	52	“ Funnel cake ! ”
33931	33940	33923	33923	Austin	52	“ You ’re going for a sugar high ? ”
33941	33950	33951	33951	Austin	52	“ Best high out there , trust me . ”
34046	34052	34053	34053	I	52	“ Are you doing okay ? ”
34061	34072	34053	34053	I	52	“ Do n’t worry about me . I ’m fine . ”
34105	34118	34101	34101	I	52	“ You know the road ahead is n’t going to be easy . ”
34119	34124	34129	34129	I	52	“ The road ahead ? ”
34125	34128	34129	34129	I	52	“ Withdrawal , ”
34136	34145	34129	34129	I	52	“ It ’s going to be really hard . ”
34146	34153	34101	34101	I	52	“ I suspect it will be . ”
34154	34175	34176	34176	Austin	52	“ You do n’t have to do it alone . You have people who care about you , you know ? ”
34184	34229	34176	34176	Austin	52	“ I ’m doing fine , Jules . It ’s a slow process . I ’m not going to go cold turkey . It ’ll take time , but as long as I ’m with you , I feel like I can do anything . ”
34436	34444	34432	34432	I	52	“ Well , what about your art ? ”
34617	34620	34621	34621	she	710	“ Austin ? ”
34629	34634	34621	34621	she	710	“ Uh , yeah ? ”
34654	34666	34645	34645	I	52	“ I asked what you wanted to know about my art . ”
34667	34670	34671	34671	I	52	“ Right . ”
34679	34686	34671	34671	I	52	“ What have you done lately ? ”
34687	34690	34691	34691	she	710	“ Nothing , ”
34704	34721	34691	34691	she	710	“ Why not ? With your talent , you could have your own studio exhibit downtown . ”
34722	34729	34730	34730	I	52	“ I do n’t feel inspired . ”
34737	34757	34730	34730	I	52	“ Tell me what we have to do to inspire you . Because you can not waste that talent . ”
34758	34761	34671	34671	I	52	“ Austin — ”
34762	34813	34691	34691	she	710	“ No , Jules , you need to be in classes . You need your own studio . Practice makes perfect and all that . If you ’re helping me , then do n’t think I ’m going to sit back and let you ignore something that brings you joy . ”
34814	34830	34831	34831	she	710	“ Who the hell are you , and what have you done with Austin Wright ? ”
34847	34855	34856	34856	She	710	“ Same person I ’ve always been . ”
34859	34864	34856	34856	She	710	“ We ’ll see . ”
34905	34912	34913	34913	I	52	“ Oh , look , progress , ”
34925	34933	34919	34919	Her	710	“ Do n’t make me cut you . ”
34934	34951	34893	34893	she	710	“ Well , the last couple of times I ’ve tried this , you almost did . ”
34952	34959	34960	34960	I	52	“ You were being a dick . ”
34963	34973	34960	34960	I	52	“ Ca n’t change the way we are together . ”
34974	34985	34919	34919	Her	710	“ So , I should be jumping down your throat . ”
34986	34992	34960	34960	I	52	“ With your tongue preferably . ”
34993	34996	34960	34960	I	52	“ Pig . ”
35078	35087	35071	35071	she	710	“ Take it or leave it , babe . ”
35088	35095	35096	35096	I	52	“ I ’ll think on it . ”
35146	35150	35151	35151	She	710	“ Ferris wheel ? ”
35156	35164	35151	35151	She	710	“ Nah , let ’s play games . ”
35165	35176	35151	35151	She	710	“ What ? You ’ve been on every other ride . ”
35177	35180	35151	35151	She	710	“ So ? ”
35181	35206	35207	35207	Julia	47	“ You do n’t want to make out on the top of the Ferris wheel ? Are you really going to deny me this ? ”
35210	35219	35207	35207	Julia	47	“ I ’m kind of afraid of heights . ”
35220	35223	35224	35224	I	52	“ What ? ”
35227	35234	35224	35224	I	52	“ I thought you were fearless . ”
35235	35243	35244	35244	she	47	“ How could you possibly think that ? ”
35248	35265	35266	35266	She	47	“ You take on everything headfirst . You ’re strong and smart . You kick ass . ”
35315	35323	35324	35324	she	47	“ Everyone has to have a flaw , ”
35350	35357	35324	35324	she	47	“ I have n’t found yours . ”
35358	35363	35364	35364	she	47	“ Oh , Austin , ”
35373	35382	35364	35364	she	47	“ You must not be looking very hard . ”
35383	35392	35393	35393	I	52	“ I ’d be happy to look later , ”
35397	35405	35393	35393	I	52	“ Oh , I bet you would . ”
35484	35496	35474	35474	She	47	“ How lucky am I ? They give out consolation prizes . ”
35497	35501	35507	35507	she	47	“ Poor thing . ”
35502	35506	35507	35507	she	47	“ Your turn , ”
35518	35526	35507	35507	she	47	“ I want a giant stuffed animal . ”
35664	35672	35673	35673	she	47	“ You ’re horrible at this game , ”
35679	35689	35673	35673	she	47	“ Can I just buy the goddamn stuffed animal ? ”
35690	35701	35702	35703	the guy	726	“ Sorry , sir . They ’re not for sale , ”
35706	35724	35725	35725	Julia	47	“ That would n’t be any fun anyway . Where is your consolation - prize Tootsie Roll ? ”
35728	35734	35735	35735	My	52	“ I ’m not done ! ”
35767	35790	35791	35791	She	47	“ Seriously , Austin , it ’s not a big deal . I do n’t think anyone can knock that thing down . ”
35799	35806	35807	35807	He	726	“ Does it actually even move ? ”
35823	35831	35832	35832	she	47	“ Oh , this is too good , ”
35926	35932	35916	35916	I	52	“ Fuck , I suck . ”
35933	35937	35938	35938	she	47	“ You do , ”
35941	35946	35947	35947	I	52	“ You really do . ”
35998	36017	35986	35986	his	729	“ I ’ve never seen anything so pathetic in my life . You ’ve earned this , dude . ”
36031	36038	35986	35986	his	729	“ Look what I won you ! ”
36039	36047	36048	36048	She	47	“ Oh , I ’m so lucky . ”
36064	36076	35986	35986	his	729	“ We ’ll probably have to share custody of the kid . ”
36077	36086	35986	35986	his	729	“ Nope . It ’s your fucking unicorn . ”
36087	36095	36096	36096	I	52	“ Do n’t kill our love fern ! ”
36111	36126	35986	35986	his	729	“ You and Morgan would so get along with your bad taste in movies . ”
36127	36134	36135	36135	she	47	“ That movie is a classic , ”
36153	36164	35986	35986	his	729	“ So , what are you going to name it ? ”
36165	36180	36193	36193	her	47	“ It ’s not a goldfish . We do n’t have to name it . ”
36181	36190	36191	36191	Julia	47	“ Why do you hate your new unicorn ? ”
36198	36212	36191	36191	Julia	47	“ If I name it , it ’ll probably be Glitter Sparkles Sprinkles V. ”
36218	36234	36191	36191	Julia	47	“ Yeah . I am not sharing custody on a unicorn named Glitter Sparkles Sprinkles V. ”
36235	36244	36245	36245	she	47	“ Why do you hate my new unicorn ? ”
36251	36265	36245	36245	she	47	“ How about we compromise with something that does n’t sound mildly edible ? ”
36266	36272	36191	36191	Julia	47	“ I ’m thinking Waffle . ”
36273	36280	36281	36281	I	52	“ Waffles are edible , Jules , ”
36286	36298	36281	36281	I	52	“ For some reason , I can only think of food . ”
36305	36312	36299	36299	I	52	“ Waffle the Unicorn it is . ”
36313	36331	36332	36332	We	732	“ Do n’t worry , Waffle . You ’ll have two great parents who will love you . ”
36367	36383	36384	36384	I	52	“ You ’re going to be crazy about this damn unicorn , are n’t you ? ”
36393	36403	36404	36404	she	47	“ You ’re the one who wanted joint custody , ”
36491	36494	36484	36484	I	52	“ Austin ? ”
36495	36498	36499	36499	She	47	“ Yeah ? ”
36637	36645	36646	36646	I	52	“ We should get out of here , ”
36707	36712	36713	36713	I	52	“ Fuck , Jules , ”
36831	36836	36837	36837	she	47	“ We should n’t , ”
36841	36848	36837	36837	she	47	“ You do n’t want to ? ”
36849	36864	36837	36837	she	47	“ That ’s not it . I just … wanted this to be different . ”
36865	36872	36837	36837	she	47	“ Does it feel the same ? ”
36873	36879	36837	36837	she	47	“ Yes , and no . ”
36887	36894	36880	36880	I	52	“ Then , we can wait . ”
36895	36906	36907	36907	she	47	“ But I really fucking want to taste your cock , ”
36938	36941	36932	36932	she	47	“ Fuck , ”
37118	37121	37122	37122	I	52	“ Jules , ”
37125	37134	37135	37135	She	47	“ I ’m a tease . I know . ”
37295	37304	37286	37286	Julia	47	“ I ’ve always wanted to do that . ”
37305	37314	37335	37335	She	47	“ Fuck , woman , feel free anytime . ”
37315	37326	37335	37335	She	47	“ I think you ’re going to have to reciprocate . ”
37327	37334	37335	37335	She	47	“ It would be my pleasure . ”
37493	37499	37500	37500	he	52	“ Ca n’t forget Waffle , ”
37515	37520	37500	37500	he	52	“ You are ridiculous . ”
37521	37529	37530	37530	We	749	“ I take my custody very seriously . ”
37624	37631	37615	37615	Austin	52	“ There you go , buddy . ”
37632	37643	37644	37644	Austin	52	“ I wish you were like this all the time . ”
37651	37660	37644	37644	Austin	52	“ I am like this all the time . ”
37661	37684	37615	37615	Austin	52	“ Uh , no , you ’re not . Most of the time , you do n’t give a shit about anything . ”
37685	37703	37617	37617	Waffle	110	“ All this time , you ’ve thought that I do n’t care about you , Jules ? ”
37704	37762	37644	37644	Austin	52	“ What else am I supposed to think with the way you act ? Every time we are together , you make some snide remark about getting me in bed . You did n’t care that I had a boyfriend , which I suppose should n’t have been a surprise , and you are generally a jerk . ”
37763	37778	37779	37779	He	751	“ Truth is , I do n’t know how else to act around you . ”
37797	37805	37786	37786	Waffle	110	“ So , you go with antagonistic ? ”
37806	37827	37644	37644	Austin	52	“ Yes . It ’s easier than telling you that I ’ve thought about you every day since you left . ”
37828	37836	37837	37837	I	52	“ That was almost two years ago , ”
37843	37847	37837	37837	I	52	“ It was . ”
37848	37877	37644	37644	Austin	52	“ You could not have been into me this whole time . You were the one who fucked up . You were the one who pushed me away . ”
37878	37892	37893	37893	I	52	“ I know . I ’m not going to make that mistake again . ”
38016	38019	38020	38020	he	751	“ Jules , ”
38026	38029	38020	38020	he	751	“ Hmm ? ”

38182	38199	38200	38200	I	52	“ Just wanted to do it once before we went back to yelling at each other . ”
38203	38212	38213	38213	He	751	“ You ’re so confident that we will . ”

39732	39754	39718	39718	I	52	“ I told Julia I was going to give up alcohol . I should probably get rid of all this shit . ”
39755	39764	39718	39718	I	52	“ That’s … a big deal , Austin . ”
39765	39771	39772	39772	Patrick	1597	“ Yeah . I know . ”
39808	39818	39819	39819	Patrick	1597	“ Clearly , you ’re not going cold turkey , ”
39827	39859	39819	39819	Patrick	1597	“ No . I ’m cutting back . Try to wean myself off of it . Not drinking around Jules . It ’s easier being sober when I ’m with her . ”
39860	39869	39819	39819	Patrick	1597	“ Harder at home , I ’d imagine . ”
39870	39874	39819	39819	Patrick	1597	“ And work . ”

40008	40019	40020	40020	I	52	“ She threatened to stab you with a butcher knife ! ”
40040	40050	40033	40033	he	1597	“ Okay . Well , that was … unfortunate . ”
40051	40054	40055	40055	I	52	“ Unfortunate , ”
40061	40072	40055	40055	I	52	“ Anyway , Mindi said you stayed at their place . ”
40073	40087	40088	40088	Patrick	1597	“ I got wasted and crashed there . Mags was n’t even around . ”

40152	40164	40139	40139	Morgan	64	“ That Austin is n’t going to fuck up with Julia . ”
40165	40173	40174	40174	I	52	“ You and Julia are back together ? ”
40267	40270	40271	40271	Morgan	64	“ Great ! ”

40292	40307	40308	40308	I	52	“ I ’m so glad I ’m being met with Her Majesty ’s approval , ”
40312	40325	40308	40308	I	52	“ Hey , dickface , do n’t make me kick your ass . ”
40326	40333	40334	40334	She	64	“ Bring it , Mini Wright . ”
40352	40358	40341	40341	she	64	“ I will end you . ”
40359	40372	40373	40373	Landon	52	“ Oh , Jesus , what trouble are you two getting into ? ”
40393	40398	40399	40399	Morgan	64	“ Austin started it ! ”
40402	40409	40410	40410	I	52	“ What are you ? Twelve ? ”

40445	40451	40452	40452	Morgan	64	“ Austin ’s dating Julia ! ”
40455	40468	40452	40452	Morgan	64	“ I did n’t realize I needed to make an official announcement . ”
40479	40489	40469	40469	Jensen	1111	“ Congrats , man . I really like Julia . ”

40601	40607	40608	40608	Sutton	269	“ What did I miss ? ”
40624	40628	40629	40629	I	52	“ Family meeting , ”
40632	40641	40629	40629	I	52	“ There ’s always something new going on . ”
40642	40649	40650	40650	Landon	52	“ Julia and Austin are dating , ”
40653	40657	40658	40658	Sutton	269	“ Knew it ! ”
40661	40668	40669	40669	Maverick	70	“ You did call that one , ”
40679	40684	40669	40669	Maverick	70	“ I so did . ”
40714	40722	40723	40723	Sutton	269	“ Do n’t be jealous , Mor , ”
40741	40744	40733	40733	Jason	71	“ Mommy ! ”
40745	40753	40754	40754	she	269	“ Oh , come here , honey , ”

40783	40791	40792	40792	Jensen	1111	“ Well , if that ’s settled , ”
40795	40806	40792	40792	Jensen	1111	“ we should probably head out to the Parade together . ”
41241	41249	41230	41230	Sutton	269	“ I hate this part , too . ”
41250	41256	41230	41230	Sutton	269	“ It ’s the worst . ”
41257	41262	41263	41263	she	269	“ The absolute worst , ”
41266	41282	41283	41283	I	52	“ Maverick and I have plans to try to christen a bedroom and then leave . ”
41288	41292	41283	41283	I	52	“ You would . ”
41293	41307	41308	41308	I	52	“ I think we have enough time before people get into the house . ”
41329	41333	41334	41334	I	52	“ Hurry up , ”
41337	41346	41347	41347	She	269	“ I ’ll cover as best I can . ”
41365	41372	41373	41373	Landon	52	“ Where are they off to ? ”
41376	41386	41387	41387	I	52	“ Just checking out the rest of the house , ”
41483	41486	41487	41487	she	594	“ Hey , ”
41494	41499	41487	41487	she	594	“ You look stunning . ”
41551	41554	41541	41541	She	594	“ Careful . ”
41555	41560	41541	41541	She	594	“ Never with you . ”
41595	41606	41583	41583	I	52	“ Heidi and Emery are excited we ’re together again . ”
41607	41620	41541	41541	She	594	“ I noticed that . Jensen and Landon seemed to already know . ”
41621	41632	41633	41633	She	594	“ Oh , yeah . I hope that ’s okay . ”
41642	41652	41633	41633	She	594	“ I did n’t think it was a secret . ”
41653	41661	41541	41541	She	594	“ It ’s definitely not a secret . ”
41662	41667	41633	41633	She	594	“ Well , good . ”
41668	41681	41633	41633	She	594	“ Morgan wants you to come to Fourth of July with us . ”
41682	41691	41692	41692	I	52	“ Oh ? What are you guys doing ? ”
41713	41730	41703	41703	I	52	“ One day , we ’re going to get you to say y’ all , babe . ”
41731	41735	41633	41633	She	594	“ Not likely . ”
41736	41773	41703	41703	I	52	“ For the Fourth , we go to the marathon downtown at the ass - crack of dawn . Then , there ’s a parade , we grill out , and there are fireworks at night . ”
41774	41779	41780	41780	she	594	“ Count me in , ”
41790	41802	41780	41780	she	594	“ Oh , also , I kind of got you something . ”
41814	41817	41803	41803	She	594	“ Why ? ”
41818	41825	41780	41780	she	594	“ Because I care about you . ”
41826	41837	41803	41803	She	594	“ But … I did n’t get anything for you . ”
41838	41851	41803	41803	She	594	“ That ’s okay . This is to help with your promise . ”
41852	41857	41858	41858	she	594	“ My … promise ? ”
41891	41898	41879	41879	She	594	“ Austin , you did n’t ! ”
41899	41922	41879	41879	She	594	“ I did . I signed you up for the summer art class at one of the studios in the Art District . ”
41923	41930	41879	41879	She	594	“ You ca n’t do that . ”
41931	41952	41953	41953	She	594	“ Well … I just did . And it ’s paid for you , so you ca n’t back out . ”
41975	41978	41879	41879	She	594	“ Austin ! ”
41979	42007	42008	42008	She	594	“ Babe , I ’m finding you inspiration . I said I would . Plus , I ’ll be there . So , consider it a date . ”
42036	42048	42015	42015	Her	594	“ Why will you be there ? You do n’t art . ”
42049	42053	42085	42085	she	594	“ I know . ”
42054	42069	42015	42015	Her	594	“ And you ’re really going to come to a painting class all summer ? ”
42070	42075	42015	42015	Her	594	“ I really am . ”
42076	42082	42015	42015	Her	594	“ Damn you , Wright . ”
42180	42204	42205	42205	I	52	“ Go hang with Heidi and Emery . I have to do this for a while , and then we can head out , ”
42209	42213	42214	42214	Her	47	“ All right . ”
42222	42234	42214	42214	Her	47	“ Are you going to be okay with all the alcohol ? ”
42235	42242	42243	42243	She	47	“ Yeah . I ’m fine . ”
42246	42258	42243	42243	She	47	“ You say that , but I do want to help . ”
42259	42268	42214	42214	Her	47	“ You ’re helping , just being here . ”
42292	42317	42318	42318	I	52	“ Okay . Text me if you need me . I ’m going to look around this house because , holy fuck , Austin . ”
42321	42331	42318	42318	I	52	“ Yeah , Jensen likes to go all out . ”
42332	42337	42338	42338	She	47	“ That he does . ”
42435	42440	42429	42429	Patrick	1597	“ Do n’t panic . ”
42441	42444	42445	42445	I	52	“ Panic ? ”
42464	42470	42450	42450	I	52	“ Why would I panic ? ”
42471	42481	42450	42450	I	52	“ I did n’t know they ’d show up . ”
42482	42485	42487	42487	Patrick	1597	“ They ? ”
42530	42539	42540	42540	I	52	“ What the hell are they doing here ? ”
42543	42556	42540	42540	I	52	“ I do n’t know . You said nothing was going on . ”
42557	42563	42515	42515	Maggie	101	“ Nothing is going on ! ”
42564	42580	42540	42540	I	52	“ Okay . So then … she probably wo n’t even come talk to you . ”
42581	42590	42591	42591	Patrick	1597	“ Are n’t you talking to Mindi again ? ”
42594	42598	42591	42591	Patrick	1597	“ Define talking . ”
42599	42604	42608	42608	Maggie	101	“ I hate you . ”
42675	42679	42680	42680	she	101	“ For you , ”
42699	42702	42688	42688	She	101	“ Obviously . ”
42703	42708	42709	42709	I	52	“ No , thanks , ”
42719	42727	42713	42713	Her	101	“ Are you turning down a beer ? ”
42728	42732	42733	42733	She	101	“ Just did . ”
42744	42748	42733	42733	She	101	“ Funny joke . ”
42828	42837	42822	42822	He	1597	“ What are you doing here , Mags ? ”
42853	42862	42846	42846	She	101	“ Enjoying the parade , like everyone else . ”
42863	42870	42871	42871	Mindi	99	“ Uh , hey , Austin , ”
42880	42883	42884	42884	I	52	“ Mindi , ”
42890	42931	42884	42884	I	52	“ Why do you seem so offended that I ’m here ? Mindi was the one who told me that you were at our place . If you wanted to see me , all you had to do was ask . ”
42932	42941	42942	42942	I	52	“ Well aware of that . Not interested , ”
42948	42954	42955	42955	Maggie	101	“ What ’s with you ? ”
42958	42994	42955	42955	Maggie	101	“ First , you are n’t drinking . I ’ve never seen you without a drink in your hand . And , now , you ca n’t even carry on a civil conversation with me ? ”
42995	43001	42955	42955	Maggie	101	“ I ’m dating someone . ”
43002	43015	42955	42955	Maggie	101	“ So ? That suddenly makes you unable to have any fun ? ”
43016	43021	43022	43022	I	52	“ You should leave , ”
43081	43088	43089	43089	Maggie	101	“ I ’m a paying customer , ”
43093	43096	43089	43089	Maggie	101	“ Whatever . ”
43122	43132	43133	43133	I	52	“ I was just coming to look for you , ”
43144	43153	43154	43154	she	101	“ Before or after you talked to Maggie ? ”
43158	43171	43154	43154	she	101	“ She … I … that is n’t what it looked like . ”
43172	43176	43177	43177	Julia	47	“ I bet . ”
43183	43192	43177	43177	Julia	47	“ God , I am such an idiot . ”
43193	43196	43197	43197	I	52	“ Jules , ”
43285	43288	43289	43289	I	52	“ Jules ! ”
43331	43336	43337	43337	she	101	“ Leave me alone , ”
43343	43349	43350	43350	She	101	“ No way in hell . ”
43360	43372	43350	43350	She	101	“ I need space . Just leave me alone to process . ”
43373	43381	43337	43337	she	101	“ Ca n’t do that , Jules . ”
43382	43388	43389	43389	I	52	“ Stop calling me that ! ”
43392	43398	43389	43389	I	52	“ I hate that nickname . ”
43399	43417	43350	43350	She	101	“ You did n’t have a problem with me calling you that when I was inside you . ”
43418	43435	43436	43436	She	101	“ Sex ! Is that all it ’s going to fucking come back to with you ? ”
43447	43467	43436	43436	She	101	“ This is n’t about sex . This is about you jumping to conclusions and getting pissed at me . ”
43468	43476	43477	43477	I	52	“ I ’m not pissed at you ! ”
43490	43497	43484	43484	she	101	“ Sure sounds like you are . ”
43498	43505	43484	43484	she	101	“ I ’m mad at me . ”
43506	43511	43512	43512	I	52	“ What ? Why ? ”
43574	43583	43584	43584	she	47	“ God , do n’t you see it ? ”
43603	43614	43593	43593	she	47	“ This is the reason we broke up , Austin ! ”
43615	43623	43593	43593	she	47	“ I know why we broke up . ”
43624	43644	43593	43593	she	47	“ Really ? Should I give you a refresher ? Because you must have forgotten if Maggie was here . ”
43645	43656	43593	43593	she	47	“ I did n’t even know she ’d be here ! ”
43657	43689	43593	43593	she	47	“ Yeah , and last time , I had to find out that you had a fuck buddy the hard way ! When I found her at your house , naked ! ”
43690	43694	43695	43695	I	52	“ I know , ”
43699	43760	43695	43695	I	52	“ And then to find out that not only was she there , naked , as if this were some stupid mistake you had gone through , but she was also your fuck buddy ! You had been together for a couple of years . On and off and on again . Apparently , whenever the other one gets bored . ”
43761	43767	43768	43768	I	52	“ Jules , I know , ”
43772	43821	43768	43768	I	52	“ Yeah , well , it was wonderful to find out that the only reason you hooked up with me was because she was out of town for the holidays . You used me , Austin . You were my mistake . A Wright mistake . How ironic . ”
43982	43993	43994	43994	I	52	“ Maggie and I were n’t together two years ago , ”
43998	44015	43994	43994	I	52	“ I saw her in your bed , Austin ! The day before Valentine ’s Day ! ”
44016	44058	44059	44059	I	52	“ I know you did . I wo n’t deny that she was there , and she was there to seduce me . That we ’d been together as fuck buddies for a couple of years . And all of that . ”
44069	44092	44059	44059	I	52	“ But we did n’t hook up when you and I were together , and I was n’t with her that day . ”
44093	44102	44103	44103	Julia	47	“ Then , what was she doing there ? ”
44125	44169	44119	44119	she	47	“ Exactly what you suspect she was doing there . She showed up as a surprise for me for Valentine ’s Day . Mags does n’t really care who she hurts when she wants something . She was dating someone then , too . ”
44170	44177	44178	44178	Julia	47	“ Do n’t call her Mags , ”
44181	44218	44178	44178	Julia	47	“ I ’m not going to try to justify what happened two years ago . I was an ass . I let you believe the worst about Maggie and me even though nothing was going on . ”
44219	44226	44227	44227	She	47	“ You let me believe it . ”
44236	44252	44227	44227	She	47	“ You did n’t even tell me about Maggie . You let me find her ! ”
44253	44276	44178	44178	Julia	47	“ To be fair , I did n’t know she was going to be there when we showed up at my place . ”
44277	44305	44178	44178	Julia	47	“ That ’s not fair ! That ’s bullshit . We dated for six weeks and not one word about any ex - girlfriends . Not one ! ”
44306	44317	44318	44318	I	52	“ Did you tell me about any of your exes ? ”
44333	44366	44322	44322	I	52	“ We did n’t exactly have the who - was - the - last - person - you - fucked conversation . We were too busy enjoying our lives and moving on . ”
44390	44401	44384	44384	she	47	“ I hate this . I hate arguing with you . ”
44402	44406	44384	44384	she	47	“ You do ? ”
44411	44480	44384	44384	she	47	“ I hate it when it ’s about this shit . It was two years ago . I ’d thought I was over it . But then I saw Maggie standing there so casually while you talked to her , and I just lost it . I ’m not over Maggie . I do n’t like seeing you two together . I ’ll never be okay with that . ”
44481	44503	44504	44504	She	831	“ I think that ’s totally understandable . I was telling her to leave . I do n’t want her there . ”
44507	44541	44504	44504	She	831	“ But she ’s always going to be there . Lubbock is n’t small , but it ’s small enough . With my luck , we ’re going to run into her again . ”
44542	44571	44504	44504	She	831	“ I ca n’t guarantee that you ’ll never see her again . Unfortunately , Patrick is talking to Mindi again , and that ’s her new roommate . ”
44572	44577	44578	44578	Julia	47	“ Maggie and Mindi ? ”
44586	44599	44578	44578	Julia	47	“ Great . Now , I ’m going to hate M and Ms. ”
44728	44778	44704	44704	Maggie	101	“ I do n’t care if you hate them both . I ’m telling you that , two years ago , I was so afraid of my feelings for you that I let you believe that Maggie and I had been together rather than admitting how I was feeling . ”
44779	44787	44704	44704	Maggie	101	“ That does n’t even make sense ! ”
44788	44792	44793	44793	I	52	“ I know , ”
44825	44848	44704	44704	Maggie	101	“ But I told you I was n’t going to make the same mistakes . I want us to work , Jules . ”
44849	44862	44863	44863	she	101	“ And you have n’t seen Maggie since we ’ve been together ? ”
44872	44885	44867	44867	I	52	“ That was the first time I ’d seen her in weeks . ”
44886	44890	44704	44704	Maggie	101	“ Sounds familiar . ”
44891	44935	44936	44936	Julia	47	“ It ’s not the same . I do n’t want Maggie . I want nothing to do with her . She does n’t understand the first thing about me . She tried to offer me a beer , for fuck ’s sake . ”
44956	44961	44952	44952	her	101	“ She did n’t ! ”
44962	44985	44952	44952	her	101	“ Well , she does n’t know that I ’m not drinking like I was before . She thought I was joking . ”
44986	44991	44952	44952	her	101	“ That ’s shitty . ”
44992	44997	44998	44998	I	52	“ You get me . ”
45008	45045	44998	44998	I	52	“ You help me . We work together . I ’m not afraid to admit how I feel now . You have to believe that I would n’t let Maggie come between us a second time . ”
45083	45131	45077	45077	she	101	“ I do n’t know how to explain this , Austin . I feel like a crazy person for getting so worked up , but I ’m so worried about the future . I want a future with you . I want to believe that ’s possible . ”
45132	45136	45137	45137	I	52	“ It is , ”
45140	45196	45197	45197	She	101	“ And it ’s not so much that Maggie is here . It ’s a public place . She could show up anywhere , I suppose . It ’s more the trend . My fear is that the past will repeat itself . Then , I ’ll be the idiot for falling for it twice . ”
45205	45228	45197	45197	She	101	“ Seeing her brought all my old fears to the surface . I do n’t want Maggie to be a backup plan . ”
45229	45234	45235	45235	She	101	“ She ’s not . ”
45245	45255	45235	45235	She	101	“ I ’m sorry I freaked out like that . ”
45256	45278	45279	45279	She	101	“ No need to apologize . If I saw you with Trevor , I ’d probably blow a gasket , too . ”
45284	45299	45279	45279	She	101	“ You can not be jealous of Trevor . He ’s so … Trevor . ”
45300	45304	45235	45235	She	101	“ Insanely jealous . ”
45305	45309	45235	45235	She	101	“ No way . ”
45310	45330	45331	45331	Her	101	“ The thought of putting my fist through his face did cross my mind every time I saw him . ”
45337	45353	45331	45331	Her	101	“ I never would have guessed . You always acted like you did n’t care . ”
45354	45376	45279	45279	She	101	“ I pushed you away . I hurt you . I figured seeing you with someone like that was my punishment . ”
45377	45388	45389	45389	I	52	“ What about the times you came on to me ? ”
45393	45406	45389	45389	I	52	“ Usually , I was drunk enough to let my feelings show . ”
45407	45420	45279	45279	She	101	“ You have a funny way of showing that you like me . ”
45421	45425	45426	45426	I	52	“ I do . ”
45470	45477	45478	45478	She	837	“ Want to head back in ? ”
45481	45490	45478	45478	She	837	“ Is she going to still be there ? ”
45491	45504	45478	45478	She	837	“ I can get Jensen on it . He ’s the fixer . ”
45505	45517	45478	45478	She	837	“ I do n’t know . Maybe I should just go . ”
45518	45521	45478	45478	She	837	“ Jules … ”
45522	45575	45576	45576	I	52	“ It was a wake - up call . I do n’t trust her . I do n’t trust her motives . I think , if she feels threatened , she ’ll do stupid shit . I ’ve known other girls like her . I do n’t want any part of it . ”
45593	45602	45576	45576	I	52	“ Then , I ’ll leave with you . ”
45603	45611	45624	45624	she	838	“ Do n’t you have family stuff ? ”
45612	45617	45576	45576	I	52	“ Screw family stuff . ”
45618	45623	45624	45624	she	838	“ No , Austin , ”
45637	45646	45631	45631	she	838	“ I think I want to be alone . ”
45647	45652	45576	45576	I	52	“ Are you sure ? ”
45653	45656	45631	45631	she	838	“ Yeah . ”
45657	45662	45631	45631	she	838	“ Are we okay ? ”
45663	45668	45669	45669	she	838	“ We ’re fine , ”
46277	46282	46283	46283	I	52	“ What the hell ? ”
46371	46374	46375	46375	I	52	“ Hey , ”
46386	46392	46393	46393	Heidi	594	“ What the hell happened ? ”
46515	46552	46553	46553	Heidi	594	“ Okay . So , all this time , you thought that Austin had used you for sex until Maggie got home ? Then , he ’d cheated on you as soon as she was back ? ”
46556	46562	46553	46553	Heidi	594	“ Yep . Pretty much . ”
46563	46582	46553	46553	Heidi	594	“ Why the hell did n’t you tell me this ? We could have hated on him together . ”
46583	46592	46593	46593	I	52	“ I hardly knew you at the time , ”
46611	46618	46619	46619	Emery	269	“ That ’s true , Heidi , ”
46623	46644	46645	46645	Heidi	594	“ Even you said you liked to wait a year to make serious friends because so many people leave Lubbock . ”
46650	46659	46645	46645	Heidi	594	“ Okay , fine . But then later ? ”
46660	46670	46671	46671	I	52	“ I do n’t know . I was embarrassed . ”
46680	46718	46671	46671	I	52	“ Do you think he ’s telling the truth about Maggie now ? That he lied about what had happened and only let me believe that something had happened because he was basically scared of his feelings ? ”
46719	46726	46727	46727	Heidi	594	“ That actually sounds like Austin , ”
46733	46738	46730	46730	Emery	269	“ Classic Wright behavior . ”
46739	46755	46671	46671	I	52	“ Well , what do I do ? I can not deal with Maggie again . ”
46756	46782	46783	46783	Heidi	594	“ Honestly ? I know it ’s hard , considering what he put you through in the past , but maybe you should trust him , ”
46786	46856	46783	46783	Heidi	594	“ I know ; I ’m the worst to give this kind of advice . I did n’t trust anything Landon said . I did n’t ever believe he ’d divorce Miranda . Not until the evidence was directly in my face . But Austin ’s bachelor life is pretty legendary . If he ’s willing to try to be with you , I think it ’s worth it . ”
46857	46864	46865	46865	Emery	269	“ To be honest , Julia , ”
46868	46901	46865	46865	Emery	269	“ the reason we ’ve been so excited about this is because Austin has never really dated . He has flings . And he ’s not treating you like a passing dalliance . ”
46902	46912	46913	46913	I	52	“ I want to believe that . I do . ”
46928	46970	46913	46913	I	52	“ My life has n’t always been easy . Trusting people is really difficult for me . After Austin hurt me , it confirmed everything that I ’d thought I knew about him . Giving him a second chance was unfathomable . ”
46971	46980	46981	46981	Heidi	594	“ Then , why did you do it ? ”
47043	47058	47035	47035	Austin	1597	“ When we ’re not at each other ’s throats , we ’re perfect . ”
47059	47065	47066	47066	Emery	269	“ Maybe that ’s enough ? ”
47069	47074	47066	47066	Emery	269	“ Maybe it is . ”
47686	47691	47692	47695	an African American woman	878	“ Let me guess , ”
47722	47725	47701	47701	She	878	“ Julia ? ”
47726	47731	47701	47701	She	878	“ That ’s me . ”
47732	47763	47701	47701	She	878	“ Wonderful . I ’m Nina . I ’ll be teaching this session . Grab a canvas , a palette , and some paints . We ’ll get started soon . ”
47764	47768	47769	47769	I	52	“ Thank you . ”
47827	47833	47834	47836	a Hispanic girl	47	“ Is this seat taken ? ”
47850	47857	47839	47839	She	47	“ Uh … yeah . Sorry . ”
47858	47862	47863	47863	I	52	“ No problem ! ”
48032	48035	48036	48037	the girl	47	“ Hey , ”
48047	48066	48036	48037	the girl	47	“ It looks like this is the only seat left . Is it cool if I sit here ? ”
48067	48070	48071	48071	I	52	“ Sure , ”
48105	48108	48109	48109	Nina	121	“ Okay , ”
48120	48177	48109	48109	Nina	121	“ Thank you all so much for coming out today . It ’s the start of a brand - new session , and I have a special treat for you today . Last session , we worked on portraits . We ’re going more advanced this session with life drawing , also known as figure drawing . ”
48194	48227	48228	48228	My	52	“ We ’re lucky to have a volunteer to sit in for this session . Please remember to give him our full respect . His job is n’t any easier than yours . ”
48297	48302	48296	48296	Julia	47	“ Oh my God ! ”
48317	48325	48306	48310	The girl next to me	47	“ He ’s pretty cute , right ? ”
48410	48418	48419	48419	she	896	“ You ’re bright red , honey , ”
48426	48442	48419	48419	she	896	“ It ’s okay . Is this your first time having someone sit for you ? ”
48453	48456	48443	48443	I	52	“ No , ”
48825	48832	48833	48837	the girl next to me	47	“ You should probably get started , ”
48848	48855	48833	48837	the girl next to me	47	“ We only have an hour . ”
48856	48859	48860	48860	I	52	“ Thanks , ”
48961	48964	48965	48966	the girl	47	“ Hey , ”
48972	48983	48965	48966	the girl	47	“ You should totally stay after and talk to him . ”
48984	48987	48988	48988	I	52	“ What ? ”
48993	49016	48988	48988	I	52	“ He was staring at you the entire class . I ’d be shocked if he did n’t ask for your number . ”
49017	49022	49029	49029	she	47	“ You think so ? ”
49023	49026	49029	49029	she	47	“ Totally . ”
49108	49112	49113	49113	I	52	“ Austin Wright , ”
49120	49124	49125	49125	he	52	“ Julia Banner , ”
49132	49142	49143	49143	He	52	“ I can not believe you just did that . ”
49150	49160	49143	49143	He	52	“ Why ? I ’m not self - conscious . ”
49161	49167	49125	49125	he	52	“ That is blatantly obvious . ”
49168	49186	49187	49187	he	52	“ Actually , it was kind of the bargain I made to get you in the class , ”
49202	49212	49187	49187	he	52	“ You had to bargain to get me in ? ”
49213	49261	49262	49262	I	52	“ Well , the class was full . I had a friend who works the Art Trail and suggested that he could get you in , but they needed a model . So , I sort of volunteered to do it if it would get you in . ”
49271	49285	49286	49286	He	52	“ That’s … I mean , why ? Why did you do that ? ”
49290	49303	49304	49304	he	52	“ You know why . For you , of course . Look , ”
49315	49328	49304	49304	he	52	“ I know that things have been weird between us since Maggie . ”
49335	49338	49304	49304	he	52	“ Yeah . ”
49339	49382	49304	49304	he	52	“ I get why you ’re hesitant to jump into this feetfirst . I hurt you . And seeing her brought that all back to the surface . But I ’m not dipping my toe in the pool with you , Jules . ”
49383	49390	49391	49391	I	52	“ I know , I know , ”
49434	49456	49457	49457	He	52	“ This is n’t some stunt . Watching you paint was addictive . The way you looked at me , babe . ”
49460	49480	49481	49481	He	52	“ It was a work of restraint not to get turned on while watching you do what you love . ”
49494	49505	49506	49506	He	52	“ Was it that much of a turn - on ? ”
49521	49527	49506	49506	He	52	“ What do you think ? ”
49542	49550	49506	49506	He	52	“ Looks like you were into it . ”
49551	49583	49506	49506	He	52	“ I was half - tempted to make you be the model with me . I would n’t have minded one bit if you were naked underneath me on that platform . ”
49584	49587	49588	49588	I	52	“ Filthy , ”
49591	49605	49606	49606	he	52	“ I do n’t think I was the only one thinking dirty thoughts , ”
49618	49644	49606	49606	he	52	“ I ca n’t believe you sat naked for me . For an entire class of people so that I could get into a studio . ”
49695	49704	49691	49691	he	52	“ I can sit naked for you anytime . ”
49738	49750	49729	49729	He	52	“ Watching you naked for an hour like this was torture . ”
49925	49930	49931	49931	he	52	“ Shh , baby , ”
49959	49962	49963	49963	I	52	“ Please , ”
50221	50225	50219	50219	Bliss	124	“ Oh God , ”
50238	50245	50226	50226	I	52	“ Come for me , Jules . ”
50246	50249	50250	50250	I	52	“ Yes , ”
50253	50260	50250	50250	I	52	“ Yes . God , yes . ”
50359	50365	50342	50342	Austin	52	“ Everything okay back there ? ”
50424	50448	50449	50449	Nina	121	“ It ’s my pleasure . Thank you for volunteering to sit for us . I ’ve been looking for someone for weeks , ”
50452	50463	50464	50464	Austin	52	“ It was n’t as bad as I ’d thought , ”
50467	50480	50464	50464	Austin	52	“ Well , good . I ’ll see you both next week . ”
50481	50484	50485	50485	I	52	“ Bye , ”
50567	50573	50574	50574	Austin	52	“ Where ’s your car ? ”
50609	50619	50599	50599	I	52	“ Wait … where the fuck is the Tahoe ? ”
50673	50679	50680	50680	Austin	52	“ Must have been towed , ”
50683	50686	50680	50680	Austin	52	“ Fuck ! ”
50687	50711	50680	50680	Austin	52	“ It ’s fine . Call the company on the sign and see if it ’s there . I can drive you over . ”
50712	50719	50720	50720	I	52	“ I fucking hate tow companies , ”
50761	50764	50765	50765	I	52	“ Thanks , ”
50775	50780	50781	50781	Austin	52	“ Just my luck . ”
50788	50810	50781	50781	Austin	52	“ Do n’t let this ruin our date . It happens to everyone at some point . It ’ll be fine . ”
50811	50822	50823	50823	We	936	“ You ’re right . I know . But ugh ! ”
50887	50895	50901	50901	he	726	“ I ’m here for the Tahoe . ”
50896	50900	50901	50901	he	726	“ Sure thing , ”
50917	50937	50938	50938	He	726	“ I ca n’t believe you guys even towed that parking lot . People park there all the time . ”
50941	50954	50955	50955	I	52	“ The company that owns it called it in . Bad luck . ”
50991	50999	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ You ’re all good to go , ”
51019	51022	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ Thanks . ”
51036	51054	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ All good to go . The company called in the cars there for the art studio . ”
51055	51058	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ Assholes . ”
51059	51062	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ Right ? ”
51063	51072	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ At least we got it all settled . ”
51073	51076	51077	51077	I	52	“ Yeah , ”
51087	51091	51077	51077	I	52	“ Come over ? ”
51092	51095	51000	51001	the guy	726	“ Absolutely . ”
51096	51101	51102	51102	He	726	“ See you there . ”
51156	51166	51167	51167	I	52	“ Why the hell am I awake this early ? ”
51226	51233	51234	51234	Sutton	269	“ Maverick is in the marathon , ”
51263	51294	51257	51257	I	52	“ I had to be here before seven . Be glad you got to miss the opening and all that . I barely got a kiss before he took off . ”
51295	51309	51310	51310	Sutton	269	“ Why would anyone want to run a marathon in this Texas heat ? ”
51313	51352	51353	51353	My	52	“ He ’s obsessed . This is his third this year . He ’s constantly training . He runs , like , a hundred miles a week . Ten to fifteen every morning before he goes to work . ”
51361	51368	51353	51353	My	52	“ Um … that sounds horrible . ”
51369	51374	51375	51375	she	47	“ Does n’t it ? ”
51381	51403	51404	51404	I	52	“ But I like him sexy and sweaty . Jason usually naps when Mav gets back before work . Very convenient . ”
51407	51413	51404	51404	I	52	“ Oh , I bet . ”
51414	51426	51427	51427	Sutton	269	“ How long does it take for Heidi to get waters ? ”
51430	51439	51440	51440	She	47	“ It ’s so effing hot out here . ”
51461	51468	51452	51452	her	47	“ At least he ’s happy . ”
51469	51476	51477	51477	I	52	“ Where ’s everyone else anyway ? ”
51480	51501	51477	51477	I	52	“ I did n’t think that I would be the first one here or else I would have slept in . ”
51502	51513	51452	51452	her	47	“ As if Heidi would have let you sleep in . ”
51514	51517	51452	51452	her	47	“ Truth . ”
51518	51532	51477	51477	I	52	“ All the guys and Mor are bringing in the first interview candidate . ”
51533	51539	51540	51540	Sutton	269	“ For the CFO position ? ”
51543	51549	51540	51540	Sutton	269	“ Some guy from California . ”
51550	51564	51477	51477	I	52	“ Why the hell would he come here for the Fourth of July ? ”
51565	51585	51586	51586	She	47	“ No idea . I ’m only half in the know since I ’m not working for the company . ”
51606	51617	51540	51540	Sutton	269	“ Not that I want to work for the company . ”
51618	51625	51477	51477	I	52	“ Well , you have Jason . ”
51626	51633	51634	51634	she	47	“ Even if I did n’t , ”
51638	51650	51651	51651	I	52	“ I did n’t want to work with my family either , ”
51668	51681	51682	51682	Sutton	269	“ It ’s just … they all expect it , you know ? ”
51688	51724	51682	51682	Sutton	269	“ It ’s not enough that Mav works there . Mor looks down on me because I want to stay home . There ’s nothing wrong with loving babies and wanting to raise a family ! ”
51725	51741	51742	51742	Sutton	269	“ I think you should do whatever makes you happy . It ’s your life . ”
51746	51752	51742	51742	Sutton	269	“ Oh , I do . ”
51753	51760	51761	51761	Heidi	594	“ Here you go , bitches , ”
51783	51786	51772	51772	I	52	“ Language ? ”
51787	51797	51798	51798	She	594	“ Eh , they ’ll hear it one day . ”
51801	51833	51798	51798	She	594	“ So , I heard from Landon , and he should be here soon . They just found a parking spot . And Emery is coming with her sister ’s family . ”
51834	51849	51850	51850	Sutton	269	“ Oh , Jason will be so happy that Lilyanne and Bethany are here ! ”
52162	52167	52168	52168	Jensen	1111	“ Hey , everyone , ”
52188	52241	52242	52242	David	105	“ I ’d like to introduce David Calloway . He ’s here all weekend , interviewing with the company . You ’ve already met Emery , but this is her family . This is my little sister , Sutton , with her son , Jason , and Austin ’s girlfriend , Julia . ”
52252	52269	52242	52242	David	105	“ Pleasure to meet you all . Thank you for letting me crash your family holiday . ”
52270	52276	52277	52277	Sutton	269	“ That ’s all right , ”
52280	52287	52288	52288	We	968	“ The more , the merrier . ”
52322	52329	52330	52330	he	105	“ Fuck , I missed you , ”
52336	52352	52353	52353	He	105	“ I missed you , too . How are you doing with all of this ? ”
52368	52373	52353	52353	He	105	“ It ’s fine . ”
52374	52386	52330	52330	he	105	“ You say that , and I do n’t believe you . ”
52387	52493	52353	52353	He	105	“ Okay . It fucking sucks . The entire thing feels utterly ridiculous . This guy is some big shot from Silicon Valley . What the fuck does he want to do with Wright Construction ? For that matter , what the fuck does he even know about the business ? He ’s never been in construction before . I know he ’s qualified , but we ’d have to train him from the start . I already know the job . I ’ve always known the job . The whole thing could be avoided so easily if they just went back to the board . ”
52563	52574	52555	52555	he	1597	“ You really appreciate this company , do n’t you ? ”
52575	52578	52579	52579	he	1597	“ Yes , ”
52608	52619	52583	52583	He	1597	“ I feel like this was an eye - opener . ”
52620	52624	52555	52555	he	1597	“ How so ? ”
52625	52663	52583	52583	He	1597	“ Like I ’ve just been getting by . I did n’t really care what happened as long as I could continue my life the way it was . Now … that does n’t feel like enough . ”
52724	52734	52735	52735	I	52	“ What are you going to do about it ? ”
52741	52747	52738	52738	He	1597	“ What can I do ? ”
52748	52756	52738	52738	He	1597	“ Anything you set your mind to . ”
52757	52766	52738	52738	He	1597	“ I ca n’t get the CFO position . ”
52767	52774	52775	52775	He	1597	“ Do you really want it ? ”
52784	52794	52775	52775	He	1597	“ No one ’s ever really asked me that . ”
52795	52798	52738	52738	He	1597	“ Well ? ”
52799	52844	52738	52738	He	1597	“ I do want it . But I do n’t know if I want it because it was always the position I thought I would get or if it ’s because that ’s what I want to do with the rest of my life . ”
52845	52868	52869	52869	He	1597	“ Then , maybe figure out what you do want to do with the rest of your life and go from there . ”
52877	52885	52869	52869	He	1597	“ What would I do without you ? ”
52886	52892	52893	52893	I	52	“ You ’d be lost , ”
52897	52901	52893	52893	I	52	“ Probably true . ”
52902	52927	52869	52869	He	1597	“ So , what do you think of this David guy besides the fact that you do n’t think he should get the position ? ”
52928	52945	52946	52946	Austin	1597	“ I did n’t say that . I said that we ’d have to train him . ”
52954	52962	52946	52946	Austin	1597	“ I kind of like the guy . ”
52963	52967	52893	52893	I	52	“ So begrudging . ”
52968	52976	52893	52893	I	52	“ I really want to hate him . ”
52977	52983	52946	52946	Austin	1597	“ But you do n’t ? ”
52984	53009	52893	52893	I	52	“ Nah . He seems like a good guy , smart as a whip , and charming . It ’s kind of not fair . ”
53010	53023	52893	52893	I	52	“ As if any of you Wrights know about what ’s fair . ”
53024	53030	53031	53031	he	1597	“ Watch it , babe , ”
53298	53310	53311	53311	Sutton	269	“ It ’ll probably be another hour before Mav comes through , ”
53320	53329	53311	53311	Sutton	269	“ These people are insane with their times . ”
53330	53356	53357	53357	Morgan	64	“ Watch out , Sutton . You might need a twenty - six - point - two sticker for the back of your car soon , ”
53360	53366	53367	53367	she	269	“ Mav already has one , ”
53375	53384	53367	53367	she	269	“ I know how much you love running . ”
53385	53394	53395	53395	Sutton	269	“ Adore it . My favorite thing ever . ”
53398	53409	53410	53410	Morgan	64	“ I like it as much as you like babies . ”
53414	53419	53410	53410	Morgan	64	“ I like Jason . ”
53420	53432	53367	53367	she	269	“ He does n’t count . You have to love him . ”
53433	53436	53410	53410	Morgan	64	“ Fair . ”
53437	53443	53444	53444	I	52	“ You both are ridiculous , ”
53450	53453	53454	53454	Morgan	64	“ Truth , ”
53457	53472	53454	53454	Morgan	64	“ I do n’t like babies . Sutton hates running . What about you ? ”
53473	53491	53492	53492	I	52	“ Heights . I ’ve never liked them , but a couple of years ago , I … ”
53514	53526	53506	53506	I	52	“ I do n’t know . They just freak me out . ”
53527	53530	53531	53531	Sutton	269	“ Understandable , ”
53534	53550	53551	53551	Morgan	64	“ I do n’t mind heights . It ’s the falling that would bother me , ”
53560	53567	53554	53554	Sutton	269	“ They go hand in hand ! ”
53568	53574	53575	53575	I	52	“ Yeah , they do , ”
53681	53691	53692	53692	he	105	“ And you work for the company , too ? ”
53698	53708	53695	53695	I	52	“ I do . I ’m head of HR . ”
53709	53723	53667	53667	her	64	“ Wonderful to meet you . Did you grow up here as well ? ”
53724	53739	53695	53695	I	52	“ No , I ’m the only transplant . I moved here from Ohio . ”
53740	53749	53695	53695	I	52	“ That must have been a big change . ”
53750	53754	53695	53695	I	52	“ It was , ”
53758	53770	53771	53771	He	105	“ I would assume as big as coming from northern California . ”
53775	53783	53771	53771	He	105	“ Yes . Though you have snow . ”
53784	53795	53796	53796	Morgan	64	“ True . It does n’t snow that much here . ”
53801	53808	53796	53796	Morgan	64	“ It snows enough for me . ”
53809	53824	53771	53771	He	105	“ I ’m glad I never have to shovel another driveway in my life . ”
53825	53831	53832	53832	David	105	“ I could see that , ”
53835	53856	53832	53832	David	105	“ Things seem … slower here . California is always go , go , go . Do you love it ? ”
53857	53873	53874	53874	I	52	“ Well , I would say that Wright is still go , go , go , ”
53878	53900	53874	53874	I	52	“ But Lubbock is definitely a slower pace . It has that nice small - town vibe in a bigger city . ”
53901	53918	53919	53919	His	105	“ I ’ve noticed that . I like it so far . Different than I expected . ”
53925	53937	53919	53919	His	105	“ And you do n’t work for the company , right ? ”
53938	53945	53946	53946	she	269	“ I ’m the only one , ”
53964	53972	53973	53973	She	269	“ He ’s adorable . Yours right ? ”
53976	54007	54008	54008	David	105	“ He looks just like his dad though . I had to carry him for nine months , and he came out looking like someone else . Not exactly fair . ”
54141	54144	54145	54145	Sutton	269	“ Annie , ”
54148	54156	54145	54145	Sutton	269	“ what ’s going on with you ? ”
54157	54160	54161	54161	Annie	121	“ Mav , ”
54165	54173	54161	54161	Annie	121	“ Mav … Mav , he collapsed . ”
54174	54177	54178	54178	she	121	“ What ? ”
54199	54208	54189	54189	she	121	“ Is he okay ? Where is he ? ”
54209	54294	54295	54295	My	52	“ About a mile back . They were going to send an EMT , but I just took off to come get you . They ’re taking him to the hospital . I do n’t know what ’s wrong . We had almost made it all the way . One minute , we were joking about hugging you with how sweaty we were . The next , he was on the ground . You … you need to get to the hospital right away . ”
54333	54341	54342	54342	Kimber	54	“ We ’ll take care of Jason , ”
54354	54358	54359	54359	Sutton	269	“ Thank you , ”
54399	54408	54409	54409	Jensen	1111	“ You can come with us , Annie , ”
54412	54416	54417	54417	she	64	“ Thank you , ”
54431	54448	54449	54449	Jensen	1111	“ We should all probably go to the hospital to find out what ’s going on , ”
54470	54478	54479	54479	I	52	“ Do you think he ’s okay ? ”
54491	54497	54479	54479	I	52	“ I do n’t know . ”
54984	54988	54971	54971	She	47	“ Hey babe . ”
55021	55026	55006	55006	I	52	“ How ’s Sutton ? ”
55033	55048	55027	55027	Julia	47	“ God , what a stupid question . I ’m sure she ’s horrible . ”
55049	55057	55058	55058	Julia	47	“ Yeah . She ’s not good . ”
55067	55079	55058	55058	Julia	47	“ I ca n’t imagine . I just … can’t imagine . ”
55080	55118	55027	55027	Julia	47	“ No , I do n’t think any of us can . It made me want to come see you immediately . Touch you , feel you , make sure you were still here , still real . ”
55136	55141	55127	55127	I	52	“ That ’s sweet . ”
55142	55184	55206	55206	Julia	47	“ It ’s the truth . The thought that you could be gone sent me into a panic . I ca n’t explain it . I could n’t breathe . I could n’t think . I just needed to see you . ”
55185	55205	55206	55206	Julia	47	“ Sutton will feel that every day , and when she looks for Mav , he ’ll be gone , ”
55209	55217	55218	55218	I	52	“ Maybe we should get you home . ”
55262	55266	55267	55267	she	47	“ All right , ”
55270	55280	55267	55267	she	47	“ Should we say good - bye to anyone ? ”
55281	55288	55289	55289	She	47	“ I ’ll just text Jensen . ”
55385	55395	55396	55396	I	52	“ Maybe we should get you in a shower , ”
55410	55422	55399	55399	She	47	“ How is she going to be able to go on ? ”
55423	55439	55399	55399	She	47	“ I do n’t know , Jules . It ’s not going to be easy . ”
55440	55499	55399	55399	She	47	“ It ’s going to be impossible . I was there with her all day . I saw her love for that man . She was sad because she ’d barely gotten a kiss before he left for the marathon . She ’s going to regret every single thing that happened this morning . It ’s just wrong . ”
55500	55550	55551	55551	She	1026	“ I know . There ’s nothing any of us can do for Sutton , except be there for her . And , right now … we ca n’t do anything . So , let me take care of you . It ’s the only thing I can do . ”
55561	55568	55551	55551	She	1026	“ I really want a drink . ”
55569	55572	55573	55573	I	52	“ Okay , ”
55577	55583	55573	55573	I	52	“ I can do that . ”
55584	55597	55598	55598	She	1026	“ Fuck , Austin . No . No , no , no . ”
55607	55624	55598	55598	She	1026	“ I should n’t have a drink . Definitely not around you . That ’s horrible . ”
55635	55651	55598	55598	She	1026	“ You ’re hurting . It ’s perfectly normal to want to numb the pain . ”
55652	55656	55598	55598	She	1026	“ Do n’t . ”
55657	55665	55598	55598	She	1026	“ I wo n’t drink with you . ”
55666	55671	55598	55598	She	1026	“ It ’s mean . ”
55672	55679	55680	55680	I	52	“ It ’s okay , Jules , ”
55691	55703	55680	55680	I	52	“ It ’s not okay . None of this is okay . ”
55704	55707	55708	55708	She	1026	“ Julia . ”
55721	55786	55715	55715	I	52	“ None of this is going to get better today . Not for Sutton . Not for you . Not for anyone . Beating yourself up for how you ’re feeling is n’t going to help anything . If you want a drink , I ’ll pour you one . I ’ll take care of you . Just let me take care of you . ”
55787	55792	55793	55793	she	1026	“ Oh , Austin , ”
55998	56002	56003	56003	she	1026	“ Thank you , ”
56006	56010	56003	56003	she	1026	“ Of course . ”
56470	56493	56448	56448	I	52	“ You know , Jules , with everything that happened today , I do n’t want any more regrets in my life . ”
56494	56497	56448	56448	I	52	“ Mmhmm ? ”
56498	56559	56448	56448	I	52	“ I know we might have started out in a fucked up way . That we ’ve had our ups and downs . But all I could think when I found out about Mav was that … they did n’t get enough time . Not by a long shot . They were only married for a year and a half . ”
56560	56564	56565	56565	she	47	“ I know , ”
56571	56586	56565	56565	she	47	“ Life is so uncertain . I do n’t want us wasting our moment . ”
56587	56597	56598	56598	I	52	“ We ’re not wasting our moment , Austin . ”
56915	56919	56907	56907	Austin	70	“ You okay ? ”
56925	56932	56920	56920	I	52	“ How could anyone be okay ? ”
56933	56937	56938	56938	He	70	“ I know . ”
57165	57173	57174	57174	Morgan	64	“ Sut , I ’ll take him , ”
57284	57287	57279	57279	Jensen	1111	“ Sut . ”
57288	57292	57293	57293	she	1048	“ Just go , ”
57297	57309	57293	57293	she	1048	“ Sutton , come on . I ’ll drive you home . ”
57310	57316	57317	57317	Jensen	1111	“ I said , go . ”
57408	57414	57401	57401	Austin	70	“ Come on , Jules . ”
57547	57556	57557	57557	Austin	70	“ I was n’t looking forward to that , ”
57560	57566	57557	57557	Austin	70	“ I ’d imagine not . ”
57567	57580	57581	57581	He	70	“ The world sure is n’t fair to the Wrights , huh ? ”
57604	57650	57596	57596	he	70	“ Sutton lost our mom when she was only one year old , just like Jason . She grew up without a mom , and he ’s going to grow up without a dad . Then , our dad died when she was only eleven . ”
57651	57654	57583	57583	his	70	“ Awful . ”
57655	57665	57596	57596	he	70	“ I always thought she was the lucky one . ”
57666	57669	57596	57596	he	70	“ How ? ”
57670	57701	57702	57702	He	1068	“ She does n’t really remember them . She did n’t have to have their shadows following her around . She ’s shone brighter and loved easier and felt deeper . ”
57712	57725	57702	57702	He	1068	“ And then this happens . How much can one person take ? ”
57783	57800	57801	57801	he	1068	“ I ’m really worried that she ’s going to lose all that brightness and joy , ”
57804	57855	57801	57801	he	1068	“ She does n’t know how much she ’s the glue to our family . The optimism to our pessimism . The idealism to our cynicism . I would n’t blame her if she did . She ’s lost a piece of herself . But I hate it for her . ”
57856	57864	57865	57865	I	52	“ She ’ll come back to herself , ”
57868	57892	57865	57865	I	52	“ You just have to be there for her when she needs you . And she ’ll need you . All of you . ”
57893	57897	57801	57801	he	1068	“ And you . ”
57898	57901	57865	57865	I	52	“ Me ? ”
57902	57910	57865	57865	I	52	“ You were there when it happened . ”
57911	57917	57801	57801	he	1068	“ I suppose I was . ”
57918	57938	57939	57939	I	52	“ You ’ll always be ingrained in the memory of that day . She ’ll need you , too . ”
58209	58216	58217	58217	Austin	70	“ Let ’s get some air , ”
58257	58267	58268	58268	he	70	“ You looked like you were about to hyperventilate , ”
58271	58292	58268	58268	he	70	“ Yeah . It was hard to breathe in there . I do n’t know how Sutton ’s doing it . ”
58293	58304	58244	58244	Austin	70	“ Jules , I ’ve been thinking a lot lately . ”
58305	58309	58268	58268	he	70	“ About what ? ”
58310	58313	58314	58314	he	70	“ Us , ”
58321	58357	58314	58314	he	70	“ I wasted two years without you all because of some idiotic reason . I should n’t have feared my feelings for you . This is what I want . You are what I want . ”
58369	58390	58358	58358	I	52	“ You are what I want , too . I appreciate you taking care of me during the last week . ”
58391	58404	58405	58405	My	52	“ I plan to do it for the rest of my life . ”
58410	58417	58418	58418	He	70	“ That ’s a bold statement . ”
58425	58433	58418	58418	He	70	“ It is . It really is . ”
58434	58448	58358	58358	I	52	“ You want to be with me for the rest of your life ? ”
58449	58478	58479	58479	he	70	“ Yes . One day , I ’m going to be the man you deserve . Then , I ’m going to put a ring on your finger , ”
58494	58507	58479	58479	he	70	“ Going to give you my name and make you mine forever . ”
58580	58589	58590	58590	He	70	“ You ’re already the man I deserve . ”
58593	58610	58590	58590	He	70	“ I assure you , I ’m not . But I ’m going to get there . ”
58684	58689	58690	58690	Austin	70	“ What is it ? ”
58709	58712	58697	58697	he	70	“ Nothing , ”
58725	58729	58697	58697	he	70	“ You sure ? ”
58732	58736	58737	58737	I	52	“ Just overwhelmed . ”
58823	58826	58827	58827	she	269	“ Hey , ”
58830	58835	58827	58827	she	269	“ Sorry about that . ”
58846	58856	58857	58857	Sutton	269	“ You do n’t have to apologize to anyone . ”
58863	58948	58857	58857	Sutton	269	“ I know . I just … hate all of this . I hate every last thing about it . I should feel thankful that all these people want to help me , but I do n’t . I feel nothing . I look around for Mav to make fun of the big event , and then I remember … he ’s not here . He ’s never going to be here again . And I do n’t know how to live that life . ”
58949	58958	58959	58959	I	52	“ You do n’t have to entertain anyone , ”
58963	58981	58959	58959	I	52	“ If you do n’t like any of this , then I ’ll tell everyone to leave . ”
58982	58988	58857	58857	Sutton	269	“ It ’d be rude . ”
58989	58992	58993	58993	I	52	“ So ? ”
58999	59035	58993	58993	I	52	“ I do n’t mind being the bad guy . You do not have to be available right now . You have to do what ’s best for you and Jason . That ’s it . ”
59036	59044	58857	58857	Sutton	269	“ You ’d do that for me ? ”
59045	59051	59052	59052	Austin	70	“ Of course we would , ”
59059	59068	59052	59052	Austin	70	“ Would you do something else for me ? ”
59069	59074	59075	59075	I	52	“ What ’s that ? ”
59100	59108	59112	59112	Austin	70	“ Take me to get a tattoo ? ”
59113	59120	59121	59121	I	52	“ You ’re sure about this ? ”
59141	59146	59147	59147	She	269	“ More than sure . ”
59217	59223	59224	59224	Julia	47	“ She ’ll do great , ”
59227	59235	59224	59224	Julia	47	“ The first one is the hardest . ”
59243	59246	59224	59224	Julia	47	“ What ? ”
59247	59256	59257	59257	Sutton	269	“ I was just thinking the same thing . ”
59275	59278	59268	59268	I	52	“ Sorry . ”
59279	59283	59284	59284	Sutton	269	“ Do n’t , ”
59320	59327	59328	59328	Sutton	269	“ Let ’s just do this , ”
59372	59375	59376	59376	Nick	134	“ Austin , ”
59384	59401	59376	59376	Nick	134	“ I was happy when you called , man . What are we doing for you ? ”
59402	59407	59408	59408	I	52	“ Not for me , ”
59411	59418	59408	59408	I	52	“ This is my sister Sutton . ”
59419	59423	59424	59424	he	134	“ Virgin skin ? ”
59427	59435	59436	59436	Sutton	269	“ Yeah , this is my first , ”
59446	59455	59456	59456	She	269	“ Great . You know what you want ? ”
59459	59462	59456	59456	She	269	“ Yeah . ”
59463	59467	59468	59468	Nick	134	“ And you ? ”
59477	59481	59471	59471	He	134	“ May I ? ”
59506	59519	59503	59503	Nick	134	“ Please tell me , I get to add to this masterpiece . ”
59520	59534	59535	59535	she	269	“ I have n’t quite figured out what my next tattoo will be , ”
59539	59563	59564	59564	Michael	135	“ Whoever did the rest of your work really knew what they were doing . I ’d love to play on your skin . ”
59578	59583	59564	59564	Michael	135	“ Language , love . ”
59584	59599	59564	59564	Michael	135	“ Michael , appreciate her beautiful work , and then get back to me . ”
59600	59607	59608	59608	Michael	135	“ She ’s not my type , ”
59619	59628	59612	59612	Nick	134	“ You ’re not mine either , honey . ”
59649	59662	59642	59642	Julia	47	“ That ’s probably for the best since I ’m with Austin . ”
59663	59673	59674	59674	Michael	135	“ Oh , new honey . I love it . ”
59680	59683	59684	59684	Austin	70	“ Girlfriend , ”
59692	59715	59687	59687	Nick	134	“ How new and different . Now , let ’s focus on the sister . You know what you ’re in for ? ”
59716	59722	59723	59723	Sutton	269	“ They filled me in , ”
59736	59742	59728	59728	she	269	“ A couple of times . ”
59750	59785	59786	59786	Julia	47	“ I bet they did . They ca n’t help it . Now , let ’s head back and get you prepped . Tell me everything about you . What are we doing today ? ”
59806	59809	59810	59810	Julia	47	“ Nervous ? ”
59813	59823	59810	59810	Julia	47	“ Yeah , but I can handle anything now . ”
59824	59832	59833	59833	Sutton	269	“ What are you going to get ? ”
59840	59921	59833	59833	Sutton	269	“ A dandelion . It ’s how Mav and I started . We ’d known each other for a year before he worked up the nerve to ask me out . Said I was out of his league . Then , we were at a party . We were both a little tipsy . It was silly at the time , but he plucked a dandelion and wished on it for us . It ’s been our thing since then . ”
59922	59927	59928	59928	Julia	47	“ It ’s perfect , ”
59944	59947	59948	59948	Sutton	269	“ Yeah , ”
59960	59968	59951	59951	She	47	“ Thanks for being here for me . ”
59969	59973	59974	59974	Julia	47	“ Of course , ”
59977	59989	59990	59990	I	52	“ I ’m happy for you and Austin , you know ? ”
59997	60002	59990	59990	I	52	“ Thanks , Sut . ”
60003	60042	59951	59951	She	47	“ I know that I ’d never be able to do this with anyone else . Thank God Jensen is n’t prejudice and does n’t care what someone looks like as long as they can do the work . ”
60043	60054	60055	60055	I	52	“ I would have been fired a long time ago , ”
60063	60116	60058	60058	Sutton	269	“ Yeah , right . For one , you can cover your tattoos with a button - up , but Julia has hers on display . She dyes her hair . She has a nose ring . Her skin is a palette of colors . She does n’t hide who she is . ”
60258	60265	60266	60266	she	47	“ It was n’t so bad , ”
60279	60288	60289	60289	Julia	47	“ We ’re going to get you addicted , ”
60296	60304	60292	60292	Sutton	269	“ I feel like I already am . ”
60879	60886	60887	60887	Patrick	1597	“ Do you have a drink ? ”
60894	60908	60887	60887	Patrick	1597	“ What the hell , man ? I thought you were cutting back ? ”
60909	60915	60916	60916	I	52	“ I am . Fuck ! ”
60938	60946	60887	60887	Patrick	1597	“ I just … need a drink . ”
60947	60963	60887	60887	Patrick	1597	“ Dude . No . You just want a drink . Is this about Sutton ? ”
60964	60967	60887	60887	Patrick	1597	“ Maybe . ”
60968	60999	61000	61000	Patrick	1597	“ Look , I ’m like your brother . I ’ve been there from the start . I know that Maverick ’s death ca n’t be easy with your past , ”
61003	61013	60887	60887	Patrick	1597	“ But is having a drink really the answer ? ”
61014	61022	61023	61023	I	52	“ Do you have one or not ? ”
61028	61044	61023	61023	I	52	“ I ’m not going to fucking give you one when you ’re like this . ”
61045	61051	61052	61052	Patrick	1597	“ You ’re a dick . ”
61055	61086	61052	61052	Patrick	1597	“ You ’ve been doing really well , dude . Take some deep breaths , and get yourself back under control . Would you have gone to Julia for this ? ”
61087	61092	61023	61023	I	52	“ Of course not ! ”
61093	61103	61052	61052	Patrick	1597	“ Then , you do n’t need that drink . ”
61104	61108	61109	61109	I	52	“ I know ! ”
61121	61141	61109	61109	I	52	“ I know I do n’t . But … what the fuck am I going to do , Patrick ? ”
61142	61163	61164	61164	I	52	“ You ’re going to sit your ass back down and deal with it , like how everyone else does . ”
61167	61174	61164	61164	I	52	“ How does everyone else deal ? ”
61175	61179	61180	61180	he	1597	“ With time , ”
61183	61195	61164	61164	I	52	“ I know that ’s not what you want to hear . ”
61196	61203	61164	61164	I	52	“ No , it ’s not . ”
61204	61210	61211	61211	I	52	“ But this will pass . ”
61283	61292	61293	61293	I	52	“ Okay . Yeah . You ’re right . ”
61316	61327	61328	61328	I	52	“ Are we still on for my birthday next week ? ”
61331	61343	61328	61328	I	52	“ I ’m down . What do you want to do ? ”
61344	61358	61328	61328	I	52	“ I ’d say dinner , but Mindi and I are off again . ”
61359	61363	61328	61328	I	52	“ Big surprise . ”
61364	61379	61328	61328	I	52	“ I do n’t want to be the third wheel with you and Julia . ”
61380	61387	61328	61328	I	52	“ Then , invite someone else . ”
61388	61399	61400	61400	I	52	“ I guess I could see if Mor is free . ”
61438	61450	61430	61430	Patrick	1597	“ But maybe we should just go out with the guys . ”
61451	61456	61457	61457	Patrick	1597	“ Cool , man . ”
61468	61484	61465	61465	Case	138	“ You should probably stay in here until you ’re okay again . All right ? ”
61660	61663	61664	61664	I	52	“ Coming ! ”
61683	61688	61678	61678	Unease	139	“ Who is it ? ”
61689	61700	61701	61702	the man	726	“ I have a delivery you have to sign for , ”
61705	61711	61701	61702	the man	726	“ What ’s it for ? ”
61712	61717	61718	61718	I	52	“ Uh … flowers . ”
61772	61777	61778	61778	I	52	“ Sorry about that , ”
61788	61796	61797	61798	the guy	726	“ No problem . Just sign here , ”
61902	61905	61906	61906	I	52	“ Seriously ? ”
62166	62169	62170	62170	I	52	“ Austin , ”
62326	62329	62330	62330	I	52	“ Fuck , ”
62502	62518	62519	62519	he	1597	“ You going to get your ass in here and let me finish you off ? ”
62522	62525	62526	62526	I	52	“ Depends , ”
62529	62555	62526	62526	I	52	“ No , it fucking does n’t . Get out of that fucking dress now , or I ’m going to get it very wet . ”
62556	62565	62566	62566	Austin	1597	“ Oh , I get a choice now ? ”
62631	62641	62623	62623	I	52	“ Want to taste what you do to me ? ”
62678	62689	62662	62662	he	1597	“ That what you want me to do to you ? ”
62799	62807	62808	62808	he	1597	“ I love watching you touch yourself , ”
62816	62827	62808	62808	he	1597	“ But your pussy coming under my tongue is better . ”
62869	62873	62874	62874	I	52	“ Holy fuck , ”
62877	62888	62874	62874	I	52	“ You ’re going to be saying that a lot . ”
62895	62902	62874	62874	I	52	“ Were you thinking about me ? ”
62915	62921	62903	62903	I	52	“ Only you , babe . ”
62922	62933	62934	62934	He	1597	“ What was I doing that got you so hard ? ”
62951	62959	62945	62945	I	52	“ First , you sucked me off . ”
62984	62988	62989	62989	I	52	“ And then ? ”
62992	63005	62989	62989	I	52	“ Then , you let me take that sweet ass of yours . ”
63006	63012	63013	63013	His	1597	“ That what you want ? ”
63077	63091	63092	63092	he	1597	“ Fuck , Jules ! Jesus Christ ! Fuck , fuck , fuck , ”
63106	63117	63095	63095	I	52	“ You ’re going to be saying that a lot , ”
63142	63150	63136	63136	Austin	1597	“ Do n’t fucking take those off . ”
63151	63154	63167	63167	His	1597	“ Oh ? ”
63155	63166	63167	63167	His	1597	“ I ’m fucking you in that . Only that . ”
63175	63200	63201	63201	I	52	“ I ’m never going to be able to look at those heels again without thinking about you showing up and getting me off . ”
63230	63237	63238	63238	he	1597	“ I want to try this , ”
63241	63245	63246	63246	He	1597	“ Try what ? ”
63327	63332	63333	63333	he	1597	“ God , Jules , ”
63415	63422	63423	63423	he	1597	“ Perfect . You ’re perfect , ”
63467	63471	63472	63472	he	1597	“ Not yet , ”
63475	63478	63479	63479	I	52	“ Please , ”
63519	63527	63511	63511	I	52	“ You ready to come for me ? ”
63727	63733	63734	63734	I	52	“ That was … wow , ”
63740	63747	63748	63748	he	1597	“ Yeah . It really was , ”
63829	63843	63844	63844	Austin	1597	“ You took everything out of me . I could go to sleep . ”
63852	63869	63844	63844	Austin	1597	“ I ’d just have to wake you up for another round when I got back . ”
63870	63886	63887	63887	He	1597	“ You ’d have to convince me . This one was a thank - you . ”
63894	63900	63887	63887	He	1597	“ A thank - you ? ”
63901	63908	63909	63909	His	1597	“ Yeah . For the flowers . ”
63915	63919	63920	63920	I	52	“ What flowers ? ”
63936	63943	63920	63920	I	52	“ The lilies you sent me . ”
63944	63954	63887	63887	He	1597	“ Uh , I did n’t send you lilies . ”
63955	63960	63920	63920	I	52	“ Wh - what ? ”
63961	63970	63971	63971	he	1597	“ Who ’s sending you flowers , Jules ? ”
63977	63986	63971	63971	he	1597	“ Who do I need to beat up ? ”
63987	63990	63991	63991	I	52	“ I … ”
63994	63998	63991	63991	I	52	“ Oh no . ”
64064	64069	64070	64070	I	52	“ Oh , fuck , ”
64073	64076	64070	64070	I	52	“ Jules ? ”
64077	64088	64089	64089	I	52	“ No , no , no , no , no , ”
64096	64121	64089	64089	I	52	“ You ’re white as a ghost . What is going on ? Does this have to do with who sent you the flowers ? ”
64138	64148	64089	64089	I	52	“ Oh my God , I ’m so stupid . ”
64149	64155	64089	64089	I	52	“ What is going on ? ”
64156	64163	64164	64164	I	52	“ I thought I got away , ”
64167	64174	64089	64089	I	52	“ I thought I was safe . ”
64175	64184	64185	64185	I	52	“ Babe , you ’re safe with me . ”
64196	64203	64185	64185	I	52	“ I ’m not safe anywhere . ”
64204	64215	64089	64089	I	52	“ You ’re scaring me . What is going on ? ”
64216	64224	64225	64225	I	52	“ My name is n’t Julia Banner , ”
64241	64249	64235	64235	His	1137	“ Okay . What is your name ? ”
64250	64254	64185	64185	I	52	“ Juliana Peterson . ”
64255	64268	64185	64185	I	52	“ I do n’t understand . Why did you change your name ? ”
64269	64274	64235	64235	His	1137	“ Because of Dillon . ”
64275	64288	64289	64289	I	52	“ And who is Dillon ? This guy send you the flowers ? ”
64292	64297	64298	64298	My	52	“ I think so . ”
64302	64310	64298	64298	My	52	“ He ’s my ex - boyfriend . ”
64311	64320	64235	64235	His	1137	“ A serious one , I ’m guessing . ”
64321	64336	64298	64298	My	52	“ Yeah . The reason I did n’t want to have the exes talk . ”
64337	64353	64354	64354	I	52	“ So , why is he sending you flowers ? Are you still seeing him ? ”
64365	64427	64354	64354	I	52	“ No , Dillon destroyed my life . There ’s so much you do n’t know , Austin . Fuck . I wanted to tell you everything . I wanted to tell you who I really was . Ever since Mav died , I wanted to spill it all , but I just … I was worried you ’d hate me . ”
64428	64437	64449	64449	He	1138	“ Jules , how could I hate you ? ”
64438	64448	64449	64449	He	1138	“ Because you do n’t know anything about me . ”
64459	64470	64449	64449	He	1138	“ I know everything I need to know about you . ”
64471	64477	64503	64503	he	1138	“ You say that now . ”
64478	64502	64503	64503	he	1138	“ Then , tell me . You have a different name . So what ? I plan to change your last name anyway , ”
64507	64513	64503	64503	he	1138	“ You can tell me . ”
64514	64539	64540	64540	I	52	“ I met Dillon the summer before college . He was … he was bad news . I liked … like guys that way , ”
64553	64644	64645	64645	He	1139	“ I was enamored . Dillon only showed me the parts of him that he wanted me to see . I gave up my full ride at Northwestern to stay home and go to community college . I could n’t be away from him . He would n’t let me be away from him . I was that idiot girl . He was dealing drugs . I knew but thought it did n’t really matter . You do n’t grow up around Akron without seeing your fair share of drugs . “
64687	64693	64681	64681	I	52	” I shook my head . “
64751	64752	64746	64746	I	52	” “
64762	64763	64746	64746	I	52	” “
64820	64821	64799	64799	She	1143	” “
64829	64830	64831	64831	I	52	” “
64839	64843	64831	64831	I	52	” I admitted . “
64854	64855	64846	64846	I	52	” “
64867	64868	64846	64846	I	52	” “
64874	64884	64885	64885	He	2142	” I whispered , putting all the pieces together . “
64903	64904	64905	64905	Julia	47	” “
64915	64916	64905	64905	Julia	47	” “
64920	64924	64917	64917	I	52	” I whispered . “
64937	64938	64939	64939	He	2142	” “
64952	64953	64954	64954	I	52	” “
64964	64982	64983	64983	I	52	” Austin said . He stood and started pacing the room . His hands clenched and unclenched . “
65002	65003	65004	65004	I	52	” “
65009	65010	65011	65011	Austin	1597	” “
65013	65014	65011	65011	Austin	1597	” “
65021	65080	65081	65081	Austin	1597	” He continued pacing , absentmindedly running his hands through his hair . I could see his brain working . I did n’t know if he was trying to find a solution or if he was just pissed at me . I knew the look on his face . He wanted a drink . I was overloading him . “
65083	65084	65081	65081	Austin	1597	” “
65088	65101	65081	65081	Austin	1597	” he snapped . I recoiled into myself , and he sighed . “
65114	65115	65108	65108	I	52	” “
65120	65121	65108	65108	I	52	” “
65183	65184	65185	65185	You	1148	” “
65192	65306	65185	65185	You	1148	” Austin Wright might be an asshole . He might have a drinking problem . He might put himself first in most things . But no one was as bad as Dillon . If this was already too much , there was no way I could tell him the rest . If I peeled back all the layers of Juliana Peterson , no one could love her . She was a broken , used girl . And , when I thought about Dillon , I became that scared , helpless girl again . Rather than the strong woman who ’d gotten away and built her own life . And I needed Julia Banner . “
65315	65328	65307	65307	We	1150	” Austin said abruptly . I nodded , knowing he was right . “
65336	65337	65307	65307	We	1150	” “
65343	65344	65345	65345	Austin	52	” “
65354	65355	65345	65345	Austin	52	” “
65360	65361	65345	65345	Austin	52	” “
65372	65373	65374	65374	Julia	47	” “
65376	65377	65374	65374	Julia	47	” “
65398	65418	65393	65393	me	52	” Fire burst in his eyes at that suggestion . He did n’t seem to like that one bit . “
65434	65435	65436	65436	I	52	” “
65449	65450	65442	65442	I	52	” “
65462	65467	65442	65442	I	52	” I told him . “
65495	65496	65493	65493	Jules	52	” “
65503	65674	65499	65499	You	52	” I said . I did n’t want to fight . I ’d just dropped a lot on Austin . It was unfair of me to just expect him to be okay with something I ’d been dealing with all of my adult life . Not that I was okay with anything that had happened with Dillon . Austin seemed frazzled the rest of the time as we got ready . All the tension that had left his body from the hot sex we ’d had was gone . He threw on jeans and a button - up with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows . After running product through his hair , he hustled me out of his house in my slightly damp dress . He finally conceded in letting me drive my own car , but he followed me all the way to Heidi ’s . We both parked in the driveway . He hopped out of his idling car and came around to help me out . “
65677	65687	65499	65499	You	52	” I said , leaning forward to kiss him . “
65698	65699	65499	65499	You	52	” “
65714	65729	65733	65733	Jules	52	” His cupped my cheeks and dragged me into a slow , steady kiss . “
65735	65736	65733	65733	Jules	52	” “
65745	65771	65742	65742	I	52	” He sighed and looked like he wanted to say so much more , but that was when Landon stepped out of the front door . “
65788	65794	65773	65773	I	52	” Austin flipped him off . “
65799	65803	65773	65773	I	52	” Landon snickered . “
65834	65835	65828	65828	He	1597	” “
65843	65861	65828	65828	He	1597	” Austin asked . Landon punched him as he passed by , walking toward the Alfa Romeo . “
65866	65867	65863	65863	I	52	” “
65871	65875	65863	65863	I	52	” Austin said . “
65882	65892	65863	65863	I	52	” Landon slid into the driver ’s side anyway . “
65902	65903	65895	65895	You	1154	” “
65915	65916	65895	65895	You	1154	” “
65921	65922	65895	65895	You	1154	” “
65928	66098	66099	66099	Girl	1161	” Austin kissed me one more time before kicking Landon out of the driver ’s seat and zooming off toward Patrick ’s party . I sighed with relief . I was glad that conversation was done with . He had some time to hang with the guys and decompress . Hopefully , that would help him wrap his head around the truth bomb I ’d dropped on him . Now , I had to do it all over again with my girls . They deserved to know as well . Especially because , if Dillon was here in Lubbock , then no one was safe . Not really . I took a deep breath and then went inside to find Heidi and Emery . Heidi was in a hot - pink sundress with her blonde hair in long , beachy waves . Emery was in cutoff jean shorts and Converse . Apparently , I ’d chosen incorrectly for girls ’ night . Heidi arched an eyebrow at my appearance . “
66110	66114	66099	66099	Girl	1161	” I smiled . “
66122	66130	66131	66131	I	52	” Emery snorted , next to Heidi . “
66135	66136	66131	66131	I	52	” “
66159	66168	66145	66145	You	1161	” It was my turn to look disbelieving . “
66179	66180	66181	66181	You	1161	” “
66184	66188	66181	66181	You	1161	” Heidi cried . “
66200	66201	66181	66181	You	1161	” “
66212	66252	66181	66181	You	1161	” I asked . Heidi and Emery shared one of their customary looks before nodding . We moved into the living room with the exposed wood beam ceiling and stone fireplace . It was stunning . Obviously custom built . “
66257	66261	66181	66181	You	1161	” Heidi asked . “
66270	66271	66268	66268	Austin	52	” “
66280	66382	66268	66268	Austin	52	” I frowned down at my tightly clasped fingers and then delivered the news I ’d told Austin . A weight lifted off of me as I finally got to divulge who I really was to my friends . And better yet … they did n’t hate me . They did n’t hate me for lying and hiding who I was . Dillon had always said that anyone who really got to know me could never really like me . No one other than him , of course . It was hard to dispel that poisonous voice whispering in my ear . “
66385	66393	66268	66268	Austin	52	” Heidi said , shaking her head , “
66405	66406	66268	66268	Austin	52	” “
66414	66418	66268	66268	Austin	52	” Emery said . “
66421	66435	66436	66436	I	52	” Heidi and Emery said together . They raised their hands in unison . “
66459	66460	66449	66449	he	52	” “
66471	66475	66461	66463	This Dillon guy	52	” Emery said . “
66485	66486	66489	66489	Julia	47	” “
66502	66507	66489	66489	Julia	47	” Heidi chimed in . “
66517	66518	66489	66489	Julia	47	” “
66527	66590	66489	66489	Julia	47	” Emery muttered . Of course she would snag on that . She ’d gotten a full ride to Oklahoma and dropped out of her PhD program after her professor boyfriend cheated on her . She was now a high school teacher . I was n’t surprised that the idea of someone smart screwing up in such a spectacular way hurt her . “
66596	66602	66489	66489	Julia	47	” Not my worst either … “
66620	66624	66625	66625	I	52	” Heidi said . “
66695	66696	66697	66697	He	2142	” “
66703	66707	66708	66708	He	2142	” Emery said . “
66721	66722	66725	66725	He	2142	” “
66731	66732	66725	66725	He	2142	” “
66744	66754	66738	66738	he	2142	” Heidi said , chewing on her bottom lip . “
66787	66788	66789	66789	Pussy	146	” “
66791	66795	66789	66789	Pussy	146	” Emery spat . “
66805	66809	66810	66810	I	52	” Heidi said . “
66827	66834	66838	66838	he	2142	” I laughed at her analogy . “
66857	66929	66851	66851	him	2142	” I shuddered and closed my eyes . The last time I ’d seen Dillon flashed before my eyes . The way he ’d held me . By my hair . The way he ’d spat in my face . Literally and figuratively . The terror as he lost control . Fucked up on who knew how many drugs . Pissed at me for … God , everything . Just everything . “
66932	66944	66851	66851	him	2142	” Heidi said , sinking into the cushion at my side . “
66952	66962	66945	66945	You	1172	” Emery took the seat on the other side . “
66982	66983	66992	66992	us	1173	” “
66994	67001	67002	67002	Em	1174	” Heidi said , nudging me . “
67010	67016	67004	67004	I	52	” Emery rolled her eyes . “
67024	67025	67004	67004	I	52	” “
67032	67033	67034	67035	Dear Lord	1172	” “
67037	67043	67034	67035	Dear Lord	1172	” Emery shook her head . “
67070	67167	67061	67061	We	1173	” I wanted to believe them . I appreciated what they were saying . But they did n’t know Dillon . And , if they did , they would n’t want to get involved . I would n’t want them involved . But I smiled and nodded . I agreed to stay in and have a chill night . Emery put on Buffy the Vampire Slayer while Heidi found some sweats and a T - shirt that did actually fit me , to my utter shock . I suspected the pants at least belonged to Landon . “
67172	67184	67169	67170	my God	62	” Heidi said when she came back into the living room . “
67202	67203	67199	67199	I	52	” “
67211	67212	67199	67199	I	52	” “
67222	67234	67199	67199	I	52	” Emery muttered something vulgar under her breath with a muffled , “
67238	67626	67627	67627	You	1178	” and then changed the TV to a different season . Heidi piled up bowls full of ice cream so high , it rivaled Kevin McCallister in Home Alone . We all sat down and dug in . I was with Heidi . I liked bad - boy Spike . But for me … not Buffy . And that had been my problem for all of time . I always wanted the bad boys . It was as if I were marked or something . My mind drifted to Dillon , even as I tried to forget him . This was not how I ’d wanted this night to go . Not at all . But I was lucky at least . I had found friends who actually stuck by me . Girlfriends that I ’d never had before . Not even close . And a family behind me . Not a family I could n’t even claim . I chewed on my fingernail and promised myself that I ’d enjoy the rest of this night . Dillon had his own agenda . If I let him interrupt my day , then he ’d win . He wanted to throw me off and to make me feel like I was never safe . Well , I would n’t let him win . Fuck that ! Never again . Twenty - Six Austin Patrick ’s birthday was exactly what I needed right now . Not that I could tell anyone why . I was so utterly fucked up . This prick had hurt Julia . For years . She ’d been so hurt that she had to run . She ’d had to become a new person to get away from him . And then , when she ’d finally opened herself up to someone , it had been me . And what had I done ? Fucking hurt her . She never should have given me a second chance . She had to see Dillon when she looked at me . Fucking asshole addict who used and abused her good graces . That slap she ’d hit me with last fall felt so much more weighted . I ’d deserved it then . I knew I deserved it more now . Landon shot me a curious look . “
67632	67633	67627	67627	You	1178	” “
67651	67652	67655	67655	dude	729	” “
67663	67664	67655	67655	dude	729	” “
67671	67710	67669	67669	Landon	52	” He sat up straighter in his seat as we pulled up to The Shack . It was the best barbeque west of Dallas . Even if my car did hate that it had a gravel parking lot . “
67718	67722	67669	67669	Landon	52	” Landon asked . “
67725	67726	67669	67669	Landon	52	” “
67738	67739	67669	67669	Landon	52	” “
67743	67753	67669	67669	Landon	52	” I said , stepping out of the car . “
67770	67777	67781	67781	dude	729	” Landon held his hands up . “
67789	67790	67781	67781	dude	729	” “
67796	67991	67995	67995	man	52	” I locked up my car and headed through the front door , behind Landon . Patrick was already there with a few of the guys from the gym — Evan , Mick , and Connor . I was truly surprised it was this subdued , considering the fact that Patrick was such a life - of - the - party kind of guy . But I was n’t complaining . I ’d rather it just be us anyway . Landon and I ordered at the front . Landon got brisket while I got ribs . I was obsessed with them and would come to get them all the time if the Shack were closer to the office . I filled up a water cup and then headed for Patrick ’s table in the back of the restaurant , near the bar . My eyes lingered on the shelves of whiskey . I really wanted a drink . One to take the edge off . This felt like a good reason . I ’d even take a fucking beer . Anything . Instead , I sat my ass down and just stared longingly instead . “
67997	68009	67995	67995	man	52	” I said to Patrick as I waited for my food . “
68019	68020	67995	67995	man	52	” “
68030	68036	67995	67995	man	52	” Patrick raised his eyebrows . “
68054	68060	67995	67995	man	52	” I laughed and shrugged . “
68069	68070	68064	68067	a pretty amazing girlfriend	1183	” “
68077	68081	68073	68075	my lovesick puppy	1184	” Patrick joked . “
68086	68114	68119	68119	man	52	” Evan said , carrying four beers in his hands and dropping them on the table . Mick had two more drinks and passed one to Connor . “
68121	68197	68119	68119	man	52	” Patrick said , grabbing a beer . Landon took his , and Evan swigged back some of his . And then there was one . It was as if Evan had freaking looked into my brain and materialized the exact thing I wanted . But I let it sit there , in front of me , tempting , alluring . I knew exactly how it ’d taste . How it ’d make me feel . “
68206	68223	68204	68204	Austin	1597	” Evan said , pressing it over to me . Patrick and Landon shared a look . “
68232	68239	68204	68204	Austin	1597	” Patrick said with a laugh . “
68245	68253	68119	68119	man	52	” I said , meeting their eyes . “
68265	68266	68267	68267	Austin	1597	” “
68269	68273	68267	68267	Austin	1597	” Landon muttered , “
68278	68300	68275	68275	you	52	” My hand slid across the table and wrapped around the beer . God , yes , I am so sure . “
68306	68452	68275	68275	you	52	” I reassured them . I could be like everyone else . I could have one drink for my best friend ’s birthday . This was totally possible . The first sip brought it all back . It was an effort not to empty the bottle . It tasted so good . So fucking good . But I felt Landon ’s and Patrick ’s eyes on me . Worry creased in every line of their face . So , I forced myself to put the drink down and grin . Some of that worry left their eyes . Everything went back to normal . Our food came . I finished my beer . We ordered another round . We were all having such a good time that , when I went through the third beer , I was n’t even sure anyone else had noticed . “
68464	68473	68453	68453	I	52	” Evan said after we all finished eating . “
68503	68507	68508	68508	You	1187	” Patrick laughed . “
68512	68520	68508	68510	You sneaky motherfucker	1189	” Now , Landon glanced at me . “
68527	68528	68508	68510	You sneaky motherfucker	1189	” “
68537	68541	68546	68546	Austin	1597	” I asked . “
68548	68549	68546	68546	Austin	1597	” “
68581	68582	68583	68583	You	1187	” “
68590	68591	68583	68583	You	1187	” “
68594	68737	68583	68583	You	1187	” We all stood to go , and I was pleased to see that I could walk just fine . If I ’d felt drunk at all , I might have heeded Landon ’s warning , but I did n’t feel drunk . I was fine . Even better than fine . I peeled out of the parking lot of The Shack and sped toward Flips . I had n’t been in a bar since that night I was with Julia at the dueling piano bar downtown . I used to live in them . Maybe I should have been worried that it felt like coming home . But all I felt was relief as the group of us entered the favorite local bar . A large group of guys that I recognized from work , the gym , and college called , “
68740	68834	68835	68835	Peter	154	” Patrick laughed and moved to the center of the festivities . We were herded together . Beers were handed to us . Shots on trays appeared . Everything started to turn into a blur . Just a haze of alcohol like I had n’t had in a long time . Even Patrick and Landon seemed to have had enough that they were retreating back into that time before . Back when this had been my life . The next thing I knew , we were walking up to the bar like fools . “
68837	68848	68849	68849	Wright	52	” I said , tipping my head at the bartender . “
68851	68872	68849	68849	Wright	52	” I always thought he called me that because he could n’t or did n’t want to tell us apart . “
68882	68889	68876	68880	Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse	1193	” Peter ’s eyebrows rose high . “
68895	68896	68893	68893	man	52	” “
68903	68990	68899	68899	Patrick	1597	” I said , clapping my best friend on the back . Peter poured out the drinks , and I passed over my credit card to pay for it all . As a drink , the Four Horsemen was a hot fucking mess . As a shot , it was worse . One shot Jim Beam . One shot Jack Daniel ’s . One shot Johnnie Walker . One shot Jameson . And then Bacardi 151 poured over the line of shots and set on fire . “
68993	68997	68899	68899	Patrick	1597	” Landon said . “
69006	69010	68899	68899	Patrick	1597	” Patrick said . “
69015	69253	69256	69256	man	52	” He passed over his phone to Peter , who begrudgingly accepted it . I could tell he hated that request . But who fucking cared ? It was one picture . Once the three of us were lined up , Peter struck a match and touched it to the end of the line . One by one , the shots went up in flames until all were ignited . I slung an arm over Landon ’s and Patrick ’s shoulders and grinned as Peter snapped a shot . Then , we tipped back shot after shot . Jim Beam went down harsh . Jack Daniel ’s was a little smoother . Johnnie Walker was like heaven . And , by Jameson , I could hardly taste it at all . I eased back into a seat as the burn from the liquor coated my stomach . Finally . There it was . There was that feeling I ’d been missing . Numb . This would be good . I used to drink way more than this without it even touching me . I was fine . I was celebrating after all . My thoughts felt hazy . Everything was funny . I felt good . Really fucking good . God , I ’d forgotten how good I could feel . I moved forward , back to Patrick ’s side , and nearly stumbled right into Evan . “
69260	69270	69271	69271	You	52	” Evan put out a hand and steadied me . “
69278	69282	69271	69271	You	52	” I laughed . “
69288	69289	69271	69271	You	52	” “
69296	69313	69271	69271	You	52	” I passed him the beer in my hand . I ’d only had a sip . “
69318	69326	69327	69327	Patrick	1597	” Evan shook his head and laughed . “
69341	69358	69361	69361	man	52	” Patrick turned to look at me , but I was sure he was seeing double . “
69376	69377	69363	69363	I	52	” “
69389	69419	69363	69363	I	52	” A vibration came from my pocket . I jerked the phone out and promptly dropped it . I picked it up and cursed violently at the shattered screen . “
69422	69438	69439	69440	Austin Wright	52	” I called into the phone when I saw Jules ’s name on the phone . “
69442	69450	69439	69440	Austin Wright	52	” Julia said in a serious tone , “
69455	69456	69439	69440	Austin Wright	52	” “
69463	69464	69439	69440	Austin Wright	52	” “
69469	69473	69439	69440	Austin Wright	52	” she growled . “
69479	69480	69439	69440	Austin Wright	52	” “
69503	69504	69499	69501	a Four Horsemen	1196	” “
69507	69508	69499	69501	a Four Horsemen	1196	” “
69511	69515	69516	69516	I	52	” she spat . “
69532	69533	69534	69534	Babe	100	” “
69546	69547	69542	69542	I	52	” “
69561	69577	69554	69554	You	1597	” She sighed heavily into the phone and then was silent for a few seconds . “
69584	69585	69579	69579	I	52	” “
69595	69608	69609	69609	Patrick	1597	” I turned to Patrick and stuffed the phone in his hand . “
69619	69628	69609	69609	Patrick	1597	” Patrick put the phone to his ear . “
69668	69675	69721	69721	she	47	” Patrick handed the phone back . “
69682	69683	69684	69684	Babe	100	” “
69688	69689	69690	69690	I	52	” “
69698	69716	69721	69721	she	47	” Then , she hung up on me . I stared down at the phone in shock . “
69726	69731	69721	69721	she	47	” I asked Patrick . “
69766	69772	69757	69757	she	47	” I sputtered into laughter . “
69779	69783	69784	69785	Your girl	47	” Patrick shrugged . “
69795	69843	69789	69789	She	47	” I could n’t deny that . Julia was the best fucking thing that had ever happened to me . I ’d marry her right now if she wanted to do it . Course , she deserved so much more than no ring and a dirty bar . “
69848	69859	69846	69846	guys	1969	” Evan said , reaching his hand out to Patrick . “
69879	69880	69881	69881	Ha	159	” “
69883	69889	69881	69881	Ha	159	” I shook his hand . “
69896	69903	69881	69881	Ha	159	” Evan laughed and then disappeared . “
69920	69924	69914	69914	She	47	” Patrick corrected . “
69932	69933	69934	69934	You	159	” “
69944	69945	69934	69934	You	159	” “
69955	69956	69957	69957	I	52	” “
69961	69965	69957	69957	I	52	” Patrick said . “
69979	69980	69982	69982	you	159	” “
69984	70011	69982	69982	you	159	” Patrick laughed . Landon appeared then in front of us . His eyes were wary , and he suddenly seemed much more sober than us . “
70027	70041	70020	70020	she	594	” he said . He cringed as he glanced between me and Patrick . “
70054	70055	70042	70042	She	594	” “
70061	70068	70074	70074	Landon	52	” Patrick said with a shrug . “
70076	70077	70074	70074	Landon	52	” “
70086	70087	70078	70078	I	52	” “
70109	70113	70099	70099	I	52	” Patrick said . “
70127	70135	70122	70122	Heidi	594	” Landon asked with a pointed look . “
70139	70275	70276	70276	Jules	52	” he said . Landon shook his head and went to the front door to wait for the girls . It did n’t take long before they showed up at the bar . Heidi and Landon seemed to be having a heated argument at the front of the room , but eventually , they moved with Emery to the bar to talk with Peter . I knew Heidi was friends with the bartender . Plus , this was really her bar . She hustled pool here like a champ . But it was Julia who caught my attention . She was in the skimpy dress I ’d stripped her out of in the shower . And she looked hot as fucking hell . Christ , I wanted my dick in her so bad right now . “
70278	70291	70276	70276	Jules	52	” I said as she approached . She sighed , looking resigned . “
70312	70313	70314	70314	Babe	100	” “
70320	70321	70314	70314	Babe	100	” “
70341	70345	70332	70332	I	52	” she said . “
70354	70355	70332	70332	I	52	” “
70375	70376	70378	70378	everyone	253	” “
70390	70391	70388	70388	Austin	1597	” “
70399	70407	70396	70396	I	52	” She narrowed her eyes in warning . “
70425	70426	70423	70423	you	52	” “
70436	70442	70423	70423	you	52	” She clenched her jaw . “
70462	70463	70456	70456	I	52	” “
70474	70490	70467	70467	I	52	” I ran my hand up her bare arm , and she shoved me off . “
70494	70498	70499	70499	I	52	” she snarled . “
70555	70556	70549	70549	You	52	” “
70588	70589	70577	70577	I	52	” “
70605	70625	70626	70626	I	52	” she asked , her tone low . I should have heeded it , but the alcohol ignored it . “
70659	70669	70670	70670	You	52	” Her eyes were hard … yet still sad . “
70674	70675	70670	70670	You	52	” “
70680	70687	70670	70670	You	52	” She did n’t even flinch . “
70796	70808	70794	70794	You	52	” Her eyes traveled the length of me with deep pity . “
70822	70843	70794	70794	You	52	” She waited for my response , but I had none . What the hell could I say to that ? “
70939	71287	71288	71288	Jules	52	” Then , she turned on her heel and walked away from me . My head was swimming with her words . With the cruel indifference I ’d flung at her . Here was the perfect woman for me . Perfect in every single fucking way . And she was walking out the door . If she left , then I knew she was n’t just leaving the bar . She was leaving me . I was running before I even finished the thought . Twenty - Seven Julia What the hell had I been thinking ? I had known what I was walking into . I had known that Austin would relapse . It was only a matter of time . But the argument , the nonchalance , the entitlement . I could be there for him . I could bring him back to the light . I could even see him through therapy or rehab . But , right now , he did n’t even care . He immediately defaulted to the douche that I ’d sworn I ’d never get back together with . The kind of guy I ’d never , ever date . Because I knew what it felt like to be used , to be manipulated and abused . I was not going to go through that again . Maybe , when he sobered up , Austin would feel differently about his drinking and our argument . But how long until it all happened again ? It hurt that I ’d trusted him . I ’d finally confided in him . He knew the danger I was facing . And , instead of having dinner with Patrick for his birthday , Austin had gotten smashed . There would have been nothing he could do if I ’d needed him . I did n’t deserve that . That was why I ’d put a stipulation on our date in the first place . Austin was a better person when he was sober . But he was the only person who believed otherwise . “
71290	71367	71368	71368	Dillon	2142	” Austin called behind me . But I kept walking . Straight out the front door of Flips . I had just made it to my car when a hand clamped around my upper arm . I screamed and jumped back . But the hand held . And everything narrowed down to the moment when a body stepped out of the shadows by my car and materialized , fully formed , into a thing of nightmares . “
71370	71371	71374	71374	Jules	52	” “
71376	71446	71374	71374	Jules	52	” he said with a lethal , manic smile . My heart rate ratcheted up . My body trembled under his touch . I thought I was going to be sick . I could n’t get my breathing under control . Everything was panic , panic , and more panic . My brain was n’t firing on full cylinders . How ? How could this be happening to me ? “
71455	71460	71467	71468	baby girl	1219	” I gasped out . “
71470	71501	71502	71502	Dillon	2142	” He ran the back of his hand down my cheek in an all - too familiar way . I shuddered at his touch and felt sick to my stomach . “
71509	71513	71502	71502	Dillon	2142	” He grinned . “
71520	71590	71502	71502	Dillon	2142	” Of course he had . The bastard could charm a snake . No one had even believed me when I first came forward . Why would anyone believe his girlfriend of six years ? And , even then , the sentence had hardly stuck . I ’d been happy for anything to give me time to get away . I ’d been desperate enough to testify against him . “
71598	71614	71591	71591	You	52	” he said . Then , he rubbed his hands up and down my arms . “
71625	71682	71615	71615	You	52	” Fear held me in place . I knew that I should jerk back . That I should be the woman I ’d become in his absence . But , staring into his blue eyes and that mask of innocence he wore like a second skin , I became the girl who would never leave him . “
71685	71689	71615	71615	You	52	” I whispered . “
71693	71694	71695	71695	I	52	” “
71701	71702	71695	71695	I	52	” “
71706	71720	71695	71695	I	52	” he asked , his voice like a knife . I swallowed hard . “
71723	71797	71798	71798	Austin	1597	” Anger flashed in his eyes , but before he could respond , Austin finally reached me . Fear sparked in me . No ! I could n’t let Austin near Dillon . I could n’t let this happen . I knew what Dillon was capable of . I knew that the charges against him were the least of what he ’d done . I would never forgive myself if Austin got hurt . “
71802	71812	71813	71813	Evan	2142	” I said , stepping between him and Dillon . “
71815	71830	71831	71831	I	52	” Austin asked . He was breathing heavy , and he seemed totally disoriented . “
71839	71840	71831	71831	I	52	” “
71860	71886	71831	71831	I	52	” I stared between Austin and Dillon with my mouth hanging open . A pit opened in the pavement , and I fell into it . “
71889	71893	71831	71831	I	52	” I whispered . “
71900	71918	71831	71831	I	52	” My eyes found Dillon ’s . He gave me a perfectly blank , perfectly serene look . “
71924	71935	71922	71922	Julia	47	” he said , holding his hand out to me . “
71944	71951	71936	71936	I	52	” I swatted his hand away . “
71957	71958	71959	71959	Jules	52	” “
71978	71982	71976	71976	Evan	2142	” Austin said . “
71988	71993	71986	71986	Evan	2142	” I nearly shrieked . “
72009	72017	72007	72007	Dillon	2142	” I choked on my own words . “
72025	72088	72089	72089	Dillon	2142	” The words hung in the air , waiting for someone to crack . For the facade to shatter and everyone to realize that the game was up . Whatever Dillon had been up to while infiltrating my life , making fucking friends with Austin , and otherwise being a psycho , it was over . His stalking of me was over . “
72097	72102	72089	72089	Dillon	2142	” Austin asked slowly . “
72105	72106	72089	72089	Dillon	2142	” “
72124	72130	72115	72115	You	1222	” he demanded of Dillon . “
72136	72151	72152	72152	We	1224	” Dillon asked , as if he did n’t care about any of this . “
72172	72186	72163	72163	You	1222	” Austin said in horror . My stomach twisted . Oh , fuck ! “
72194	72199	72187	72187	I	52	” Dillon said possessively . “
72207	72208	72209	72209	Julia	47	” “
72215	72219	72220	72220	Austin	1597	” Austin said . “
72239	72250	72268	72268	man	1597	” I pleaded . Dillon laughed in Austin ’s face . “
72270	72271	72261	72261	You	1222	” “
72283	72284	72261	72261	You	1222	” “
72298	72302	72293	72293	I	52	” Dillon said . “
72336	72337	72338	72338	Dillon	2142	” “
72343	72347	72338	72338	Dillon	2142	” I spat . “
72400	72426	72393	72394	This one	1689	” Dillon shook his head , like he was disgusted with the sight of Austin . He was a good actor . Always had been . “
72487	72608	72485	72485	Jules	52	” I did n’t want to listen to Dillon . I knew what he was doing . I knew he was manipulating me and trying to turn me away from Austin . I was pretty sure I was the only person on the face of the planet who knew the real Dillon Jenkins . He never showed the insanity behind his bravado . Only to me . Still , I could n’t stop myself from turning hurt , questioning eyes to Austin . Had Dillon been following him ? Had he seen things that I had n’t wanted to see ? He might be using them to hurt us , but they could only hurt us if they were true . “
72613	72626	72627	72627	I	52	” I asked . I clenched my hands into fists and waited . “
72633	72642	72629	72629	I	52	” Austin said , stumbling over his words . “
72651	72652	72629	72629	I	52	” “
72659	72660	72629	72629	I	52	” “
72668	72669	72629	72629	I	52	” “
72678	72682	72671	72671	you	52	” I asked . “
72685	72693	72695	72695	you	52	” I breathed out in a rush . “
72699	72700	72697	72697	Austin	1597	” “
72712	72713	72707	72707	We	1237	” “
72720	72724	72707	72707	We	1237	” I shrieked . “
72745	72751	72752	72752	God	62	” I shook my head . “
72768	72769	72765	72765	Mindi	99	” “
72794	72795	72785	72785	He	52	” “
72852	72861	72862	72862	You	52	” He opened and then closed his mouth . “
72871	72872	72862	72862	You	52	” “
72881	72882	72862	72862	You	52	” “
72893	72968	72891	72891	Jules	52	” I closed my eyes against the frustrations and tried to clear my thoughts . I could feel Dillon infecting us , seeping his poisonous words and toxic personality into my life again . He was Loki , the trickster god . Preying on our fears and using the weeks he ’d spent watching us to sow that seed of doubt . To splinter the fragile relationship we had been building into solid stone . “
72975	73018	73019	73019	Austin	1597	” Austin cried . He turned his undivided , drunk attention to Dillon . And then , before I could do a single thing , Austin threw himself at Dillon . He swung wildly , sliding his fist against Dillon ’s cheekbone . “
73023	73210	73019	73019	Austin	1597	” I shouted . But he was n’t listening to me . There was nothing I could do . I knew Dillon had let Austin take that first swing . He ’d been waiting for it . Knowing that anything that came next would be self - defense . He ’d used the excuse before . Dillon had been boxing since he could walk . It was the only thing his deadbeat dad had ever given him . He was quick on his feet and could throw a punch that I knew all too well hurt like a motherfucker . Dillon ’s eyes analyzed Austin ’s drunk form before striking with the precision of someone who had been doing this for a very long time . I screamed as he battered Austin ’s face , jabbed into his ribs , and knocked him off his feet . Austin stood no chance . Maybe , if he ’d been sober , he would have had a weight advantage . Austin was solidly built , but Dillon had years of experience . It was n’t a fair fight . “
73217	73362	73363	73363	Dillon	2142	” I said . I grabbed on to Dillon ’s shoulder and tried to pull him off of Austin . He shoved me backward with one hand , throwing me into the gravel . I skidded across the blacktop and felt the top layer of my forearm take the brunt of the hit . My hip connected next , and gravel buried like shrapnel into my knee . I winced as I tried to stand , but I had to . I had to stop this fucking nightmare . Dillon could not do this . He ’d kill Austin . Fuck , he ’d kill him . Blood spewed from Austin ’s face . He was curled in on himself . The alcohol in his system must at least be keeping him from the majority of the pain . God , I hoped so . “
73367	73372	73363	73363	Dillon	2142	” I whispered hoarsely , “
73386	73398	73381	73381	I’ll	164	” He stopped assaulting Austin and turned to look at me . “
73404	73405	73401	73401	you	1873	” “
73430	73431	73437	73437	Jules	52	” “
73439	73440	73437	73437	Jules	52	” “
73471	73568	73458	73458	he	1597	” I said , my voice shaky . I needed an ounce of his bravado . Austin groaned . I thought I heard him say no , but I had to do this . I would n’t let Austin die because Dillon had found me again . Dillon seemed to take in the situation and then nodded . He ’d won . He was done . If Austin was a threat again , he ’d kill him . I saw the knowledge of that flash in his eyes . He reached a hand out to me . “
73576	73594	73595	73595	I	52	” I nodded . No mention that he was the one who had done this to me . “
73608	73609	73610	73610	Me	52	” “
73614	73677	73678	73678	Austin	1597	” I lied . Then , I followed him , trembling , as I tried hard not to look at Austin . As I followed the man I ’d sworn I ’d never let rule me again . As I entered my own personal hell and prayed I ’d be able to come out on the other side . Twenty - Eight Austin “
73682	73689	73680	73680	Austin	1597	” a voice shouted over me . “
73692	73730	73731	73731	Whaaaa	165	” someone else cried . My mind was fuzzy . Everything fucking hurt . My ribs , my face , my head . God , I felt like my head was about to rip in fucking two . “
73733	73737	73742	73742	he	165	” I slurred . “
73746	73764	73765	73765	Heidi	594	” the voice said . I opened a puffy eye and saw the person standing over me . “
73767	73768	73765	73765	Heidi	594	” “
73803	73804	73805	73805	Jules	52	” “
73807	73876	73805	73805	Jules	52	” I got out . Then , I spat , and blood landed in a wad on the floor . Floor ? Had n’t I been on the pavement ? I looked around and saw that I was back inside Flips , lying on top of the bar . They must have carried me in here without me knowing . That meant , I must have blacked out . “
73882	73887	73889	73889	she	47	” Heidi asked frantically . “
73892	73893	73894	73894	Austin	1597	” “
73908	73919	73920	73920	Landon	52	” I looked up into the face of my brother . “
73922	73923	73920	73920	Landon	52	” “
73946	73947	73938	73938	Jensen	1111	” “
73953	73963	73951	73951	Sutton	269	” I muttered . She ’d been through enough . “
73966	73976	73951	73951	Sutton	269	” Landon said hesitantly . Guilt swept his features . “
73990	74014	73987	73987	Julia	47	” I winced and tried to sit up . But everything ached , and I crashed back onto the top of the bar . “
74021	74079	73987	73987	Julia	47	” Heidi said . I could see she was worried . Everything felt so far away . I tried to grasp on to what had happened outside , but it kept slipping through my fingertips . Suddenly , nausea hit me over the head . I turned my head and threw up all over the bar floor . “
74082	74089	73987	73987	Julia	47	” Heidi groaned , turning away . “
74098	74102	74105	74105	Peter	154	” Landon said . “
74107	74108	74105	74105	Peter	154	” “
74118	74165	74166	74166	Dillon	2142	” I closed my eyes and tried to remember all the details . I did n’t know why everything kept slipping away . Is it the alcohol ? Did I have a concussion ? Fuck ! Then , it hit me . And my blood chilled . “
74168	74175	74176	74176	Julia	47	” I spat . Heidi froze . “
74182	74183	74184	74184	He	1251	” “
74188	74189	74184	74184	He	1251	” “
74194	74198	74199	74199	Evan	2142	” Heidi asked . “
74222	74234	74219	74219	He	1251	” I cut off as a wave of disorientation hit me . “
74247	74254	74237	74237	Evan	2142	” Landon filled in for me . “
74263	74264	74265	74265	Evan	2142	” “
74269	74276	74265	74265	Evan	2142	” Landon asked , clearly confused . “
74280	74284	74265	74265	Evan	2142	” Heidi gasped . “
74305	74306	74300	74300	he	2142	” “
74311	74315	74309	74309	Dillon	2142	” Landon asked . “
74349	74374	74341	74341	She	1251	” Heidi rushed off to go talk to Emery and Patrick . I slowly eased into a sitting position against Landon ’s better judgment . “
74388	74408	74411	74411	he	2142	” Landon asked . I nodded and regretted it . I cradled my head and winced at the pain . “
74459	74460	74461	74461	We	1257	” “
74464	74939	74461	74461	We	1257	” Landon assured me . But I could see that he had no clue how to do that . For once , the Wrights did n’t have a plan . We did n’t know how to fix this . My girlfriend , the love of my life , was out there , somewhere , with a psychopath , and I could n’t do a damn thing . I could n’t even walk yet . If I had n’t been drunk , then none of this would have happened . If I ’d told Julia everything , then she would n’t have been pissed at me . If she could have trusted me with her story , maybe I never would have fallen for Evan ’s bullshit . Instead , I ’d stepped right into his trap . We ’d done exactly what he wanted . And , now , he had Julia . I could n’t stand for that . I might have messed up , but she had n’t left of her own free will . She ’d done it to save me . After what she had told me about Dillon , I knew that she would n’t have gone willingly . She hated him . And that was n’t about to change in a matter of hours . Even if we were n’t together , she was n’t going to run back to the guy she ’d run from in the first place . That meant , there was only one course of action . I had to get out of this fucking bar , and I had to get my girl back . Twenty - Nine Julia I ’d saved Austin ’s life . That was what was important here . If I had n’t left , Dillon would not have stopped . He would have left Austin a bloody , dead pulp on the pavement . It had been bad enough , witnessing Dillon fuck him up , but dead ? No , I could n’t even fathom that . We were in a nondescript pickup truck that I was sure he ’d stolen . Adding grand theft auto to his record was nothing . I ’d seen him jack a car he needed for the business . He never got caught . Not before I ’d ratted him out at least . And , if it was n’t stolen , then he ’d really gone to extreme lengths in setting up this Evan personality . That was even more terrifying . The premeditation . He ’d planned this all out . Weaseled his way into my life and Austin ’s life and Lubbock life so seamlessly . Instead of approaching me as soon as he ’d gotten here , he ’d subsumed himself into a whole new identity . “
74945	74959	74960	74960	Your	1259	” I asked , picking gravel out of my arm with a wince . “
74963	74967	74960	74960	Your	1259	” I startled . “
74970	74971	74960	74960	Your	1259	” “
74986	75103	74979	74979	I	52	” I held back my shudder at the violation . In his twisted mind , he probably did n’t even think that he had done anything wrong . I was his . And that was all that mattered . It was all that had ever mattered to him . Not how I felt or what I wanted . Only his desires and obsessions . I just happened to be the person who had gotten stuck in the middle of his insanity . So , I needed to tread very carefully around him . He thought I wanted to be here . I ’d left freely . And I needed him to think that was the truth . “
75109	75110	75111	75111	I	52	” “
75114	75137	75111	75111	I	52	” he said . We pulled up to my apartment . He hopped out first and met me on the other side . “
75147	75367	75111	75111	I	52	” I nodded and then hurried for the front door . Okay , I could do this . I could figure out a way around this . A stop at my apartment meant that I had a chance to escape this . A chance to get away . I needed to focus on that now . I ’d saved Austin . No one was coming to save me . I had to save myself . As always . Dillon grabbed my purse before I could dig through it , and he removed my keys . I longingly looked at my purse for a second before turning away . My phone was in that purse . He had to know that I wanted it . Maybe he even guessed I ’d been planning to call the cops . He slid the key into the lock and opened each of them individually . Not that they had done me much good in the end . Nothing had kept Dillon out of my life . He snagged my wrist hard enough that bones ground together . I was careful not to cry out . He hated that , and it set him off . Most things did . Then , he tugged me inside and closed and locked the door behind us . “
75371	75403	75111	75111	I	52	” he said , grinning at the lilies he ’d sent me , still on the counter . I had n’t been home since I realized they were n’t from Austin . “
75417	75418	75111	75111	I	52	” “
75421	75429	75111	75111	I	52	” I whispered , stepping back once . “
75456	75466	75453	75453	your	1261	” He laughed , but it held only madness . “
75543	75544	75545	75545	Dillon	2142	” “
75547	75592	75545	75545	Dillon	2142	” I pleaded . I knew he liked to hear himself talk . The mastermind behind all of his plots . But I did n’t want to know . I really did n’t want to know how he ’d infiltrated my life so easily . “
75597	75622	75545	75545	Dillon	2142	” He turned to face me , and I swallowed . The full weight of his attention was never a good place to be . “
75626	75695	75545	75545	Dillon	2142	” I took a step forward , toward him . His blue eyes critically assessed me . He gently slipped my red hair off my shoulders . I tensed . When he was gentle , I knew it was going to be worse . Much worse . He grabbed my hair at the bottom and then wound it around his hand until it was in a tight fist . “
75708	75709	75706	75706	Jules	52	” “
75713	75737	75710	75710	I	52	” I said hoarsely . His grip on my hair tightened , angling my head backward so that I stared up at him . “
75740	75741	75710	75710	I	52	” “
75744	75788	75710	75710	I	52	” Harder . I felt some of the hair pulling from the roots . Tears came to my eyes . He was hurting me . All that time I ’d spent learning to protect myself , and still , he was hurting me . “
75795	75799	75710	75710	I	52	” he said . “
75804	75950	75710	75710	I	52	” I gasped out . Then , he smiled a chilling smile and firmly pressed his lips against mine . I knew resisting him would only mean something bad for me , and he already had the control . Swallowing back the bile rising in my throat , I opened my lips to him . He kissed me with the ferocity that came from a three - year absence . I felt nothing . Not a thing in his lips . Once , he ’d been my world . I would have given anything for any kind of reaction from him . But , now , I hated him . Fuck , I hate him ! For everything he ’d done to me and all the pain he ’d caused . For the fear I could n’t escape . For forcing me … into everything . “
75955	76020	75710	75710	I	52	” he said , shoving me off of him . My hand went to my head . I winced at the tender touch . Fuck . Fuck . Fuck . Dillon nodded his head toward the bedroom , and I anxiously entered ahead of him . He shoved me into the closet and pulled out a suitcase . He knew exactly where it was . “
76023	76027	76028	76028	Dillon	2142	” he said . “
76030	76044	76028	76028	Dillon	2142	” I said in that soft , submissive voice I knew he loved . “
76063	76070	76028	76028	Dillon	2142	” I carefully met his eyes . “
76075	76076	76028	76028	Dillon	2142	” “
76081	76082	76028	76028	Dillon	2142	” “
76088	76096	76028	76028	Dillon	2142	” he said . I was frozen . “
76100	76101	76102	76102	My	52	” “
76105	76326	76327	76327	We	1266	” Fuck . Oh , fuck . When I was twenty , Dillon had convinced me to get his name tattooed on my body . He ’d said it was more permanent than marriage . A fucking piece of paper did n’t mean shit to him . He ’d already owned me . Putting a permanent reminder on me had just sealed the deal . But the first thing I ’d done when I got out was , I ’d found the best fucking tattoo artist in the state of Ohio to tattoo over it . Dillon was right . It had been a constant fucking reminder of him . And I ’d wanted it gone . My hands were shaking when I slid up the front of my dress and showed him the navy - blue thong I wore underneath . I tugged the material down just an inch and showed him the delicate flowers and vines that covered up his name and wrapped around my hip . He could only see half of the masterpiece that started at my hip , snaked up my ribs , across the outside of my breast , and up to my shoulder . He knelt before me and traced his finger over the sensitive skin where he ’d insisted I get tattooed . “
76334	76347	76327	76327	We	1266	” he said . He leaned forward and nipped at the skin . “
76357	76370	76348	76348	We	1266	” I said , forcing excitement into my voice . He grinned . “
76374	76596	76597	76597	Jules	52	” I nodded and started haphazardly throwing clothes into the suitcase . But , as soon as he left the closet , I bolted for my safe . It was my only chance . I had to try for it . I did n’t know how much time I had or how familiar he was with my bathroom and where the medical supplies were . But I had at least a minute , maybe two if I was lucky . I typed in the combination on the lock . I held my breath as it clicked open , and then I was in a race against time . I would not be a victim . Not with all the time I had spent at the shooting range . Not with all the time I had spent becoming a new person and getting away from Dillon . I was not going back to Ohio , to that life and that person . No way in hell . I grabbed my Glock out of the case . My fingers did n’t fumble . I did n’t hesitate . I ejected the empty magazine , loaded bullets as efficiently as I had practiced time and time again at the range , reinserted the magazine , and pulled the slide back to chamber a round . “
76606	76656	76597	76597	Jules	52	” Dillon said as he entered the closet . I whirled around and held the gun level with his chest . Bigger target . I could hit his head , but if I only got off one shot , I wanted to make sure I did n’t fucking miss . “
76664	76690	76691	76691	Dillon	2142	” he demanded . He was angry . Fiery fucking angry . Ballistic , going - to - kill - me kind of crazy angry . “
76706	76707	76708	76708	Jules	52	” “
76710	76722	76708	76708	Jules	52	” he said , as if he could reason with me . “
76741	76742	76708	76708	Jules	52	” “
76750	76751	76708	76708	Jules	52	” “
76762	76763	76708	76708	Jules	52	” “
76771	76787	76764	76764	You	1268	” he growled low and deadly . But I was the one with the gun . “
76801	76802	76803	76803	Jules	52	” “
76818	76826	76803	76803	Jules	52	” Dillon took a step toward me . “
76833	76837	76803	76803	Jules	52	” I snarled . “
76846	76855	76838	76838	You	1268	” he said , taking another step forward . “
76899	76956	76957	76957	I	52	” He took one more step toward me . He was almost close enough to grab the gun if he wanted to . I could n’t let that happen . This was my only fucking chance . I aimed and fired at his foot . He jumped backward just in time to miss me shooting him . “
76965	77098	76957	76957	I	52	” Dillon reassessed me . I did n’t know who the fuck he ’d thought he was dealing with this whole time . But I was not the stupid girl he ’d manipulated . Maybe he ’d thought , because I ’d ended up with an addict , that not much had changed . Maybe he ’d only seen as much as he wanted to see . But he was seeing me for who I really was now . Finally , as if he realized he ’d lost the edge , he stepped backward , out of the closet . I followed him at the exact same pace . He never turned his back on me . He watched me , as I ’d seen him watch many opponents in the past . “
77128	77129	77123	77123	We	1273	” “
77134	77171	77132	77132	yourself	1272	” I spat . All that confidence had returned to me while I held the only thing keeping me from a miserable existence . We made it out of the bedroom and to the front door . “
77203	77243	77244	77244	I	52	” I shivered at the intensity of his words . He really believed it . He really believed that , the next time he saw me , if I did n’t go with him , he ’d kill me . “
77251	77316	77244	77244	I	52	” I told him . Dillon shot me a cocky grin . He liked that he ’d gotten under my skin . He liked knowing that , anywhere I went , I ’d be thinking about him , wondering if he ’d show up , wondering if he ’d kill me . He had to turn to slide the locks and open the door . “
77325	77341	77323	77323	Dillon	2142	” I told him when he was finally on the other side of the door . “
77364	77365	77369	77369	Jules	52	” “
77371	77372	77369	77369	Jules	52	” “
77377	77381	77369	77369	Jules	52	” I said . “
77385	77648	77649	77649	Julia	47	” I slammed the door in Dillon ’s face and hastily locked the place back up , not that I felt safe here anymore . He ’d been here . He ’d been inside . Every inch of my safe space had been violated . My knees gave out , and I sank to the floor with my back against the door . All the strength I ’d held on to , to face Dillon left me . The hand holding the gun was shaking so violently , I had to put the gun down . I ’d fired it . Oh , fuck , I ’d actually fired it . My breaths started coming out in short gasps right before I burst into tears . What the hell am I supposed to do now ? Thirty Julia I did n’t know how long I ’d sat on the floor and cried . By the time I found the strength to get up , I had seventeen missed calls from Heidi , Emery , Landon , and Patrick . Not one from Austin . My mind immediately went to the worst . Maybe I ’d left him dead on the pavement . I had n’t looked . I had n’t checked . I ’d just walked away . I called Heidi back first , holding the phone in one hand and my gun in the other . This little hunk of metal had saved me from a fate worse than death . I was n’t about to let it go anytime soon . “
77651	77659	77649	77649	Julia	47	” Heidi nearly screamed into the phone . “
77666	77667	77664	77664	Julia	47	” “
77672	77676	77677	77677	He	1597	” I asked . “
77698	77712	77713	77713	I	52	” My heart restarted . Austin is fine . He is n’t dead . “
77722	77750	77718	77718	I	52	” No . No , I ’m not . I was about as far from okay as I ’d ever been . And that was saying something . “
77757	77773	77774	77774	Em	269	” I heard Heidi turn away from the phone and repeat what I ’d said . “
77826	77827	77819	77819	he	2142	” “
77830	77835	77819	77819	he	2142	” I said abruptly . “
77847	77848	77849	77849	Julia	47	” “
77863	77870	77871	77871	He	2142	” Heidi said with a sigh . “
77908	77909	77903	77903	I	52	” “
77912	77916	77918	77918	he	2142	” I whispered . “
77988	78001	77974	77974	I	52	” I sank into the couch . Of course she was right . “
78012	78013	78005	78005	I	52	” “
78026	78027	78005	78005	I	52	” “
78035	78040	78041	78041	Emery	269	” I told her . “
78069	78070	78058	78059	The cops	1151	” “
78073	78091	78058	78059	The cops	1151	” I whispered . Is this what it ’s like to have people take care of you ? “
78120	78225	78226	78226	Julia	47	” And I never would be again . The last two years had been an illusion anyway . I ’d never been safe from Dillon . I never would be . We stayed on the phone until Heidi and Emery showed up at my apartment . Even though I knew they were outside and I ’d just hung up with Heidi , I still startled at the knock on the front door . My heart beat through my chest . I felt like I was going to be sick . It could be Dillon . I knew it wasn’t … but it could be . “
78228	78232	78226	78226	Julia	47	” Heidi called , “
78239	78240	78226	78226	Julia	47	” “
78252	78282	78246	78246	We	1285	” Emery said . I took a deep breath , turned the locks , and then opened the door . My girls stood there with terror in their eyes . “
78287	78297	78285	78285	Julia	47	” Heidi whispered when she took in my appearance . “
78303	78307	78298	78298	You	47	” Emery noted . “
78315	78346	78298	78298	You	47	” Heidi asked . I glanced down at the gun in my hand . It felt nice . Weighted and secure . Even with the barrel pointing toward the ground . “
78355	78396	78397	78397	Julia	47	” Emery said . Emery stepped forward and gently extracted the gun from my hand . I felt empty without it . Like I needed the feel of it in my palm again . It was my new security blanket . “
78399	78403	78397	78397	Julia	47	” Heidi said , “
78418	78422	78407	78407	we	1286	” I nodded . “
78427	78469	78407	78407	we	1286	” Heidi wrapped an arm around my shoulders and eased me back into the living room . Emery carefully popped out the magazine and set it down on the table . This was not the first time she ’d done that . “
78476	78519	78407	78407	we	1286	” I asked . Emery gave me a curious look and then did as I ’d asked . I had n’t been able to touch them . But I was glad they were gone . She came to sit next to me . “
78529	78533	78534	78534	I	52	” Heidi asked . “
78555	78556	78547	78547	we	1288	” “
78559	78563	78547	78547	we	1288	” Emery said . “
78572	78573	78547	78547	we	1288	” “
78586	78653	78658	78659	Officer Matthews	167	” I shook my head , and we sat in silence with just their presence working to pull some of the tension out of me . The cops showed up a few minutes later . It was a tall female cop with cropped brown hair and an overly muscled guy whose eyes swept the apartment , as if expecting Dillon to pop out at any second . “
78661	78666	78658	78659	Officer Matthews	167	” the woman said . “
78692	78693	78688	78690	Miss Julia Banner	47	” “
78698	78708	78696	78696	me	52	” I said , concentrating entirely on Officer Matthews . “
78718	78719	78712	78712	you	1291	” “
78722	78928	78929	78929	Jules	52	” I said . Then , I started from the beginning . The very beginning . The cops took some notes and asked some questions along the way . Heidi and Emery gasped in all the right places . I had to show them the gun and where I ’d fired the warning shot . They took pictures of everything and collected the shell . Officer Curtis went back to the police car while Officer Matthews inspected my place . We were almost through with everything when another car pulled up in front of my apartment . We all waited apprehensively . I ached for the gun once more . I might have finally told them the whole story , but that did n’t mean they understood . Then , Landon appeared , helping Austin through the doorway . My stomach sank when I took in Austin ’s appearance . His face was battered , almost beyond recognition . He had a tender split lip , and one of his eyes had already started to swell closed . His hand held his side . Broken ribs , Heidi had said . He looked … horrible . Dillon had done this . I wanted to cry . “
78931	78951	78952	78952	You	52	” he said , reaching for me . He tugged me into a hug , groaning at the impact . “
78964	79021	78960	78960	you	52	” I carefully wrapped my arms around his waist . I breathed him in and brought all of his warmth against me . I knew it would be the last time , and I wanted to remember the way I perfectly fit into him . Then , I took a step back and dropped my arms . “
79026	79036	79037	79038	Austin Wright	52	” Officer Matthews asked before I could say anything . “
79040	79041	79037	79038	Austin Wright	52	” “
79049	79056	79037	79038	Austin Wright	52	” Austin pointed to his face . “
79062	79072	79075	79075	he	52	” I frowned . Not the time to joke . “
79078	79079	79075	79075	he	52	” “
79091	79101	79087	79088	another officer	1293	” Austin said . His eyes darted to me . “
79111	79119	79104	79104	I	52	” Officer Curtis came back inside then . “
79154	79159	79160	79160	We	1295	” Officer Matthews nodded . “
79242	79263	79230	79230	you	52	” When the cops finally left , the room felt much too small for all the people in my apartment . “
79270	79285	79230	79230	you	52	” I asked Heidi . Her eyes widened in surprise , but she nodded . “
79294	79295	79296	79296	Jules	52	” “
79298	79302	79296	79296	Jules	52	” Austin said . “
79310	79320	79296	79296	Jules	52	” I asked , glancing around at my friends . “
79323	79363	79364	79364	Jules	52	” Everyone made a hasty departure , leaving me alone in the apartment with Austin . Standing here made me feel horribly exposed . I hated this place . I would be happy if it burned to the ground . “
79370	79393	79364	79364	Jules	52	” Austin said , stepping forward . I held my hand out and tried not to break down in front of him . “
79399	79400	79364	79364	Jules	52	” “
79433	79434	79424	79424	I	52	” “
79492	79493	79488	79488	I	52	” “
79500	79501	79488	79488	I	52	” “
79507	79525	79488	79488	I	52	” I said , looking up into his face . His beaten , bruised , swollen face . “
79533	79534	79488	79488	I	52	” “
79550	79551	79548	79548	Julia	47	” “
79580	79581	79575	79575	I	52	” “
79587	79637	79584	79584	you	47	” he tried to assure me . He took a step forward . I shuddered and pulled away . All the anger welled up inside me . All the things I ’d learned about Austin . Everything he ’d been keeping from me . I could n’t do this . “
79643	79651	79652	79652	Jules	52	” I said , my voice low . “
79654	79673	79652	79652	Jules	52	” he groaned . But he was still drunk . He ’d still be drunk for a while . “
79687	79688	79684	79684	him	1302	” “
79716	79717	79710	79710	I	52	” “
79720	79725	79726	79726	Us	1303	” he said hollowly . “
79728	79732	79726	79726	Us	1303	” I corrected . “
79740	79797	79734	79734	you	1303	” I looked him square in the eyes and saw the man I ’d fallen so desperately for . The man who I ’d needed today . And he had n’t been there . He had lied — to me , his family , to himself . I could n’t be with a man like that . “
79800	79805	79806	79806	Julia	47	” I finally said . “
79841	79842	79829	79829	I	52	” “
79854	79862	79845	79845	you	47	” I said , raising my voice . “
79917	79918	79919	79919	Jules	52	” “
79921	79922	79919	79919	Jules	52	” “
79929	79933	79919	79919	Jules	52	” I shrieked . “
79954	79958	79959	79959	I	52	” Austin cringed . “
79964	79986	79987	79987	I	52	” He ran a hand back through his hair . It was hard for me to even look at his face . “
79997	79998	79987	79987	I	52	” “
80006	80011	80012	80012	I	52	” I told him . “
80017	80069	80012	80012	I	52	” I winced at his raised voice and wrapped my arms around my body . In that moment , I felt like a victim again . I ’d managed to stand up to Dillon , and Austin was freaking out on me now . No , I could n’t do it . “
80072	80083	80084	80084	I	52	” he groaned , turning away from me and pacing . “
80103	80104	80105	80105	You	52	” “
80109	80135	80136	80136	I	52	” I shook my head and stared off into my bedroom where the remnants of the bullet I ’d fired still remained in the carpet . “
80139	80143	80136	80136	I	52	” he insisted . “
80155	80159	80144	80144	I	52	” I said . “
80174	80175	80144	80144	I	52	” “
80193	80197	80144	80144	I	52	” Austin said . “
80209	80216	80198	80198	I	52	” I straightened at his declaration . “
80264	80274	80275	80275	You	52	” I shook my head and crossed my arms . “
80324	80355	80356	80356	Dillon	2142	” He stammered over his words as shock registered . But I could n’t stop . He did n’t understand . He did n’t get what had happened to me . “
80417	80479	80480	80480	Julia	47	” It was always just me . And maybe a part of me wanted to hear Austin ’s words , to give in to what he was offering , but the other part of me , the part screaming in my ear , was saying to back out . To take care of myself and save everyone else from equal misery . “
80484	80485	80480	80480	Julia	47	” “
80530	80631	80634	80634	man	52	” I brushed past Austin , on my way out the door . His hand reached out to touch me , to stop me , but he let it drop . I ’d accomplished what I had to do . I just wished I did n’t hate myself so much for doing it . Thirty - One Austin What the fuck had just happened to my life ? I stood alone in Julia ’s apartment . She ’d just left me . I could n’t believe it . After everything … she’d walked . Landon cleared his throat behind me . “
80636	80711	80634	80634	man	52	” I did n’t say anything . I was still in shock . Dillon / Evan had n’t been as shocking as Julia breaking up with me . How could she have done it ? She had to know how I felt about her . Not that I ’d come straight out and said it , but I ’d sure acted like it . Then , one fucking fuckup had torn the house down . “
80714	80725	80634	80634	man	52	” Landon said , putting his hand on my shoulder , “
80732	80733	80734	80734	She	1318	” “
80738	80739	80740	80740	I	52	” “
80745	80749	80750	80750	She	1318	” Landon sighed . “
80769	80770	80763	80763	She	1318	” “
80773	80778	80763	80763	She	1318	” I said softly . “
80793	80794	80785	80785	She	1318	” “
80838	80839	80872	80872	she	1318	” “
80902	80903	80890	80890	She	1318	” “
80916	80921	80890	80890	She	1318	” Landon said reasonably . “
80928	80929	80890	80890	She	1318	” “
80967	80971	80958	80958	Jules	52	” Landon sighed . “
81004	81005	81008	81008	she	1318	” “
81015	81016	81008	81008	she	1318	” “
81024	81077	81079	81079	me	52	” I did n’t argue with him . I just got into the Uber he ’d called and let him drop me off at my house . Landon followed me inside just to make that Dillon did n’t happen to be there . But it was empty . A little too empty . “
81089	81093	81087	81087	Austin	52	” Landon said . “
81096	81109	81110	81110	I	52	” I said , staring , unseeing , at my empty house . “
81162	81163	81151	81151	Patrick	1597	” “
81222	81227	81205	81205	He	1597	” Landon nodded seriously . “
81239	81240	81205	81205	He	1597	” “
81270	81373	81374	81374	You	1325	” Landon sympathetically touched my shoulder once before departing . At least Landon ’s place had a state - of - the - art security system . Julia should feel safe there . Or safer at least . Safer without me . The next morning , my face was the size of a balloon , and I could n’t tell where the pain started or ended . After a delirious , pain - riddled phone call , Jensen showed up bright and early . Thank fuck he was a vampire . Jensen whistled when he saw me passed out on the couch . “
81379	81380	81374	81374	You	1325	” “
81383	81391	81374	81374	You	1325	” I said , dripping with sarcasm . “
81398	81424	81374	81374	You	1325	” Jensen said . He ’d shown up around the same time the cops had gotten there and dealt with the aftermath at the bar . “
81435	81436	81374	81374	You	1325	” “
81445	81463	81374	81374	You	1325	” I flipped him off and then winced , reaching for my fractured ribs . He laughed . “
81491	81492	81483	81483	He	55	” “
81504	81505	81499	81499	Julia	47	” “
81523	81582	81520	81520	Julia	47	” I grumbled but let him help me off the couch and into his huge truck . Noah was Emery ’s sister ’s husband . He worked at the Texas Tech Medical Center and was an all - around great guy . I liked him . I liked him even more after he stopped prodding at my injuries . “
81598	81602	81583	81583	We	1333	” Noah said . “
81633	81634	81620	81620	We	1333	” “
81640	81647	81637	81637	My	52	” I said with a sigh . “
81665	81666	81667	81667	You	47	” “
81672	81673	81667	81667	You	47	” “
81680	81690	81674	81674	Kimber	54	” Noah said with a shake of his head . “
81701	81702	81691	81691	I	52	” “
81733	81734	81728	81728	he	1761	” “
81741	81779	81728	81728	he	1761	” Noah handed me the prescription , we shook hands , and then I headed out . Jensen was still waiting for me , talking to one of the nurses he knew . Jensen knew fucking everyone . “
81782	81786	81728	81728	he	1761	” he asked . “
81797	81849	81728	81728	he	1761	” We finished the rest of the errands , and as soon as I popped a pill , I felt the worst of the bite of the pain subside . With a couple of weeks ’ recovery staring me in my destroyed face , I was glad to have the pills . “
81855	81859	81860	81860	I	52	” Jensen said . “
81867	81868	81860	81860	I	52	” “
81874	81890	81891	81891	Austin	52	” I rolled my eyes as he drove me to Flips to collect my car . “
81893	81894	81891	81891	Austin	52	” “
81897	81907	81891	81891	Austin	52	” I asked , halfway out of the truck . “
81919	81920	81913	81913	She	47	” “
81955	82000	81946	81946	you	1338	” The answer was written all over his face . No , of course not . We were Wright men . We did n’t back down from anything , and we certainly did n’t walk away from our women just because they were hurting . “
82009	82010	82013	82013	man	52	” “
82017	82097	82013	82013	man	52	” I said . Then , I shut the door and headed to my car . I made it to Landon ’s house in record time . I tried the door handle and was glad to see it was locked . I did n’t want Dillon to show up here and have easy access to Julia again . Landon appeared a couple of seconds after I rang the doorbell . He wiped his hand down his face and yawned . “
82104	82105	82013	82013	man	52	” “
82125	82126	82127	82127	She	1340	” “
82137	82152	82153	82153	She	1340	” I started to cross the threshold , but Landon put his hand out . “
82179	82180	82181	82181	I	52	” “
82186	82187	82181	82181	I	52	” “
82210	82211	82212	82212	I	52	” “
82221	82313	82314	82314	Julia	47	” I told him . Landon gave me a disbelieving look , but he moved his arm . Heidi came out of the master bedroom in one of Landon ’s golf T - shirts and short shorts . Her eyes were wary as they followed my progress toward the guest bedroom . It seemed that everyone thought it was a bad idea for me to talk to Julia . I knocked twice and waited for her to say something . But there was no response . Maybe she was still sleeping . “
82316	82317	82314	82314	Julia	47	” “
82321	82328	82314	82314	Julia	47	” she said through the door . “
82333	82334	82330	82330	we	1346	” “
82343	82344	82330	82330	we	1346	” “
82348	82349	82330	82330	we	1346	” “
82352	82362	82330	82330	we	1346	” she said firmly . I sighed in frustration . “
82376	82377	82381	82381	Austin	52	” “
82383	82384	82381	82381	Austin	52	” “
82389	82449	82387	82387	Julia	47	” No response came from the other side of the door . She was n’t going to talk to me . After everything , it was as I ’d thought . She really meant what she ’d said last night . Then , slowly , the door cracked open , and beautiful dark eyes stared back up at me . “
82455	82510	82450	82450	You	47	” she said . Then , she opened the door for me . I could work with that . Julia shut the door behind us once I was in the room . She went and sat down on the bed , but I could tell that sitting next to her would be pushing it . “
82516	82520	82450	82450	You	47	” I asked . “
82523	82524	82450	82450	You	47	” “
82531	82532	82450	82450	You	47	” “
82535	82536	82450	82450	You	47	” “
82545	82546	82450	82450	You	47	” “
82549	82602	82603	82603	I	52	” Okay … one - worded answers . I needed a way to draw my Julia out of there . She looked so run - down and bedraggled . I ’d be shocked if she ’d slept at all . And , still … she was everything I wanted in one package . “
82626	82659	82620	82620	you	47	” She ’d been staring down at her clasped hands . A million thoughts seemed to be running through her mind at once . Finally , she looked back up at me . “
82662	82663	82620	82620	you	47	” “
82698	82720	82689	82689	I	52	” I said . I wanted her to fight me , to fight back , to show some ounce of life . “
82747	82748	82749	82749	I	52	” “
82758	82765	82749	82749	I	52	” she said quietly , calmly . “
82771	82772	82773	82773	I	52	” “
82779	82792	82793	82793	I	52	” I said , dropping to my knees in front of her . “
82831	82886	82824	82824	You	47	” She turned her face away from me . No emotions clouded her eyes . I was n’t even sure if she was in pain over my words . She seemed so resigned . As if the night had solidified everything that she ’d said to me , as if she ’d set cement . “
82893	82894	82895	82895	Julia	47	” “
82905	82912	82895	82895	Julia	47	” She held her hand up . “
82980	83085	82976	82976	I	52	” I stared , slack - jawed , up at her . I ’d always felt like , even when Julia and I had been apart , there was this link between us . That , when I could get her riled up , I knew she still had feelings for me . But , overnight , that had all disappeared . She wanted nothing to do with me , and I did n’t know how to fight for something that was n’t there . A vibration from the side table fractured her attention . She immediately lunged for her phone and answered it , “
83092	83107	83108	83108	I’ll	47	” She listened on the other end for a few seconds and then gasped . “
83115	83116	83108	83108	I’ll	47	” “
83120	83137	83108	83108	I’ll	47	” I asked once she hung up the phone . She looked sick to her stomach . “
83143	83328	83108	83108	I’ll	47	” Thirty - Two Julia I was going to be sick . Definitely , definitely sick . I was standing outside of the police station with Landon , Heidi , and Austin . They ’d already called Jensen and Morgan , and Jensen had assured them that he ’d have his attorney there as soon as possible . I knew that he ’d said I should n’t say anything until the attorney got there , but I worried . What if something had happened ? What if I was somehow at fault ? I could n’t shake the feeling . Dillon could charm the cops . Sure , he had a warrant out for his arrest and now had aggravated assault and battery charges from Austin . They wanted to press for kidnapping and domestic violence for me . But is it still kidnapping if I had gone willingly ? And would the assault charges hold up if Austin had hit him first ? I would n’t put it past Dillon to have already figured a way to get out of all of this . “
83333	83343	83108	83108	I’ll	47	” Heidi asked , coming up to my side . “
83350	83455	83346	83346	I	52	” My eyes darted to Austin ’s for a split second before I walked through the front door . I could do this . I did n’t need to think about what had happened with Austin last night or the desperation in his voice this morning . I was hurting him . I did n’t want to . But I could n’t seem to stop . We spoke with a man at the front desk before he directed us to a detective ’s office . I had Heidi , Austin , and Landon wait outside the office . Heidi squeezed my hand and nodded . “
83462	83477	83480	83480	Heidi	594	” she said , pointing at a group of folding chairs across the hall . “
83482	83483	83480	83480	Heidi	594	” “
83490	83529	83480	83480	Heidi	594	” I nodded and then entered the room . The detective was an athletic woman with frizzy ginger curls and freckles . She had a shrewd appearance about her . I would n’t want to fuck with her . “
83548	83549	83544	83545	Dillon Jenkins	2142	” “
83556	83560	83553	83554	Miss Banner	47	” she said , “
83571	83572	83568	83569	Detective Taylor	169	” “
83578	83584	83576	83576	Detective	169	” I said , sitting . “
83660	83699	83700	83700	You	1362	” I sighed . Of course he had n’t just been harassing me . He ’d been working , too . Setting up a run between the Mexican border and probably going all the way back to home . “
83706	83710	83700	83700	You	1362	” she said . “
83746	83747	83748	83748	I	52	” “
83761	83772	83753	83753	You	1362	” she said , rifling through a stack of papers . “
83782	83783	83773	83773	You	1362	” “
83791	83792	83788	83788	he	2142	” “
83833	83834	83835	83835	I	52	” “
83849	83862	83867	83867	him	2142	” I gasped out . The detective looked at me , startled . “
83895	83903	83867	83867	him	2142	” I breathed a sigh of relief . “
83911	83934	83935	83935	Detective	2142	” Another knock came from the door , and a squat man stuck his head inside . My lawyer , I presumed . “
83946	83947	83948	83948	Jake	171	” “
83950	83958	83948	83948	Jake	171	” the woman said with a sigh . “
83969	83973	83975	83975	she	0	” He shrugged . “
83980	83991	83975	83975	she	0	” I frowned . No , I certainly was not . “
84005	84162	83995	83995	Julia	47	” Jake hauled me out of the detective ’s office and started speaking a million miles a minute . But my head was spinning with just one solid fact — Dillon was behind bars . And , if we played our cards right … he could be there for a very long time . A sob caught in my throat . It was far from over , but he was n’t on the loose anymore . He was n’t going to find me and kill me . He was n’t going to go after all the people I loved here . He might have ruined so many things , but he was n’t going to take this new life from me . I spent a few hours in a secluded office with Jake McCarty , going over everything that had happened . By the time I finished , I felt like I ’d been wrung out . “
84172	84188	84189	84189	I	52	” I asked finally . Jake grinned and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder . “
84203	84319	84196	84196	I	52	” But I did . I did n’t want to be indebted to the Wrights . I knew it was impossible to be rid of them , considering I worked for the company and each of my closest friends was dating a Wright brother . But it worried me that this was all related to Austin … that I never would have gotten this otherwise . And , if that was the case , then I ’d rather just pay my own legal fees if need be . At the same time , I was unbelievably grateful . I never would have known where to start finding someone . Certainly not someone like Jake McCarty . “
84369	84393	84395	84395	you	47	” I gave him a little half - smile at the notion . To be rid of Dillon forever ? It seemed impossible . “
84397	84398	84399	84399	My	52	” “
84402	84531	84399	84399	My	52	” I left the room and found that only Austin was still waiting for me . God , he really looked fucked up . His face was a wreck . It ’d been cleaned up some , but , Christ , it could n’t be safe for him to be driving , could it ? I wanted to be indifferent , like I ’d told him I was , but I was n’t indifferent to Austin . I was crazy about him and still brimming with anger . But the more I showed either of those emotions , the more he would think we could get back together . I was n’t ready for that . I did n’t know if I ’d ever be ready for that . “
84534	84543	84399	84399	My	52	” he said , rising to his feet . “
84546	84547	84399	84399	My	52	” “
84559	84606	84556	84556	Heidi	594	” I chewed on my lip and then nodded . I needed to get out of this police station . When we were back out in the hot , dusty Lubbock air , I finally felt like I could breathe again . It made no sense . “
84614	84618	84556	84556	Heidi	594	” I asked . “
84637	84646	84649	84649	Heidi	594	” He shrugged as we approached his car . “
84655	84656	84649	84649	Heidi	594	” “
84662	84663	84660	84660	her	594	” “
84676	84680	84673	84673	he	2142	” I shrugged . “
84683	84684	84673	84673	he	2142	” “
84687	84688	84689	84689	I	52	” “
84706	84707	84689	84689	I	52	” “
84711	84712	84689	84689	I	52	” “
84734	84735	84736	84736	I	52	” “
84746	84747	84736	84736	I	52	” “
84755	84801	84736	84736	I	52	” I walked around to the passenger side of his shiny red car . But he paused before opening the door . He stared down at his keys and then tossed them across the roof of the car . I caught them with one hand . “
84810	84820	84736	84736	I	52	” I stared at him , momentarily in shock . “
84829	84830	84831	84831	I	52	” “
84834	85020	84831	84831	I	52	” That was all he said as he walked around to the passenger side of the car . He dropped a kiss onto my forehead and then sat down . I pulled myself out of the trance . What the hell was happening ? I was getting to drive the Alfa Romeo ? I sank into the driver ’s seat and adjusted the seat for my short legs . He laughed when I had to pull the mirror all the way down if I was going to have any hope of seeing out the back . I thanked my dad for teaching me how to drive a stick the one time he ’d been sober in my teen years . Then , I flew out of the police station . Landon and Heidi ’s house was further out in the country , so I got to take her on long stretches of flat land . She really opened up then , and for those blissful minutes , I felt free . When I pulled into the driveway , a smile was plastered to my face . “
85028	85029	84831	84831	I	52	” “
85034	85035	84831	84831	I	52	” “
85049	85081	84831	84831	I	52	” Austin leaned across the seat as the soft rumble of the car sounded beneath us . His hand went to my cheek , and I flinched . He sat back . “
85118	85119	85107	85107	You	47	” “
85129	85139	85123	85123	I	52	” He looked intrigued by my change of direction . “
85142	85143	85123	85123	I	52	” “
85223	85238	85241	85241	me	52	” Austin ’s jaw clenched despite the pain I could see on his face . “
85276	85283	85284	85284	My	52	” I met his angry eyes . “
85294	85295	85298	85298	Julia	47	” “
85300	85301	85298	85298	Julia	47	” “
85341	85342	85333	85333	he	2142	” “
85347	85348	85350	85350	you	47	” “
85352	85356	85350	85350	you	47	” I asked . “
85374	85375	85376	85376	You	47	” “
85388	85389	85386	85386	Julia	47	” “
85444	85451	85452	85452	I	52	” I choked on that word . “
85457	85473	85474	85474	Julia	47	” I tried to get out of the car , but he grabbed my hand . “
85481	85482	85483	85483	Austin	52	” “
85485	85486	85483	85483	Austin	52	” “
85492	85511	85483	85483	Austin	52	” His eyes searched mine for a flicker of hope . But I did n’t give him one . “
85518	86090	85483	85483	Austin	52	” I wanted to feel good about walking away and taking control of my life . But , when I entered Landon and Heidi ’s house without Austin , I just felt empty . I wanted Austin . But I wanted him sober , honest , and without an ex - girlfriend who just might show up naked at his place . I could n’t make him want those things . And he had n’t proven to me that it was even possible . Knowing all the addicts in my life who had failed over and over and over again , I doubted it ever would be . Thirty - Three Austin I stared at the half - empty bottles of liquor still in my house . I ’d gotten rid of almost everything . Patrick had become the new owner of the whiskey and scotch that I was only able to get directly from the distributor . I had n’t been able to throw those out . I ’d cut back so much that I had nothing left in the cabinet in my house . I ’d once had a fully stocked wet bar . I could have made a Bloody Mary any hour of the day . God , I ’d kill for a perfectly made Bloody Mary . But I ’d have to settle for this . I took out all the bottles . A halfway - filled bottle of Maker ’s Mark . A quarter of Johnnie Walker Blue . Some Grey Goose . A shot - sized bottle of Fireball that I had n’t been able to part with . Basil Hayden ’s and Four Roses were down to the last dregs . I could work with this . I popped two pain pills and chased them with a shot of Maker ’s . Julia had left me . There was no coming back from that . None at all . She ’d been dead inside when she delivered the news . She would n’t take me back . We could n’t fix this . I could n’t fix anything . That was Jensen ’s forte . He was the family fixer . He would have been able to make this work . Even Landon had fucking figured his shit out with his crazy ex - wife to land Heidi . I was the only one who found it impossible to keep a girlfriend . Then , I ’d put myself out on the line , and she ’d walked . And , fuck , how could I blame her ? Would I want to deal with my train wreck ? I wondered how much I would have to drink to forget about Julia . Is there an amount of alcohol that ’s capable of that ? I did n’t know , but I figured I ’d give it a try . I spent a solid hour binge - watching whatever the hell was on TV at that time while taking shots . At some point , I stopped even recognizing the show . I stopped recognizing anything . There was just the alcohol and then the buzz that quickly converted into being full - out drunk . Not that I planned to stop there . I was still thinking about Julia . Trying to figure out how the hell I had let this shit happen . “
86097	86279	86280	86280	Austin	52	” I screamed as anger ripped through me . I stood , stumbling around the living room . I kicked the coffee table across the room and smashed the lamp off of the side table . I grabbed the bottle I ’d been finishing and threw it hand over fist into my mounted seventy - inch TV . The screen splintered and looked as fucked up as I felt . The glass had exploded on impact and scattered across the room . I wheezed and clutched my ribs . Even the alcohol could n’t stop the pain there , it seemed . Motherfucker . My ass crashed back down on the couch , and I clutched my head . I needed more . More alcohol . More everything . Something to make me forget . No , not something . Someone . My phone was in as shitty shape as my TV was , but it still miraculously worked after I plugged it back in . I ’d need to replace it , but right now , it did the trick . “
86282	86287	86288	86288	Mags	102	” Maggie said warily . “
86290	86294	86288	86288	Mags	102	” I breathed . “
86300	86301	86288	86288	Mags	102	” “
86305	86306	86288	86288	Mags	102	” “
86311	86312	86288	86288	Mags	102	” “
86317	86325	86326	86326	I	52	” She laughed a low throaty thing . “
86333	86334	86326	86326	I	52	” “
86346	86347	86344	86344	Maggie	101	” “
86355	86356	86344	86344	Maggie	101	” “
86365	86470	86471	86471	Maggie	101	” I hung up on her before she could respond . She ’d show . She always did . The way I ’d treated her at the Parade of Homes was the outlier in our relationship . She ’d been shocked by my behavior because I ’d never treated her poorly . Even though we did n’t have an official thing , we ’d always had fun . And , God , I could use some fun . Forgetting . Just fucking forgetting . Fifteen minutes later , a knock at the door roused me from my melancholy . I yanked open the door . “
86473	86497	86498	86498	Austin	52	” I slurred . She looked like sin itself . Her dark hair wild . A blood - red dress . High heels . “
86500	86504	86498	86498	Austin	52	” she gasped . “
86510	86543	86544	86544	Julia	47	” She reached out and tentatively ran her manicured nail down my cheek and across my split lip . I ’d almost forgotten that my face was a road map of bruises . “
86553	86554	86544	86544	Julia	47	” “
86557	86561	86544	86544	Julia	47	” she whispered . “
86572	86588	86562	86562	I	52	” I laughed , which turned into a cough , which hurt like a bitch . “
86598	86644	86645	86645	I	52	” She shrugged , as if to say , Suit yourself . I stepped forward and ran a hand down her side , over the silky material of her dress . She leaned into the touch and seemed to be searching my face for something . “
86653	86657	86649	86649	I	52	” she said . “
86660	86661	86649	86649	I	52	” “
86672	86673	86670	86670	Wright	52	” “
86681	86694	86670	86670	Wright	52	” I suggested . She laughed , as soft as a purr . “
86711	86732	86704	86704	you	101	” I shoved the door open , and she strode in . Her feet stilled after only a few feet . “
86753	86754	86742	86744	Julia ’s ex	1386	” “
86761	86762	86742	86744	Julia ’s ex	1386	” “
86769	86778	86742	86744	Julia ’s ex	1386	” she asked , whirling around on me . “
86789	86790	86791	86791	I	52	” “
86796	86804	86791	86791	I	52	” She arched an eyebrow at me . “
86810	86811	86791	86791	I	52	” “
86815	86820	86791	86791	I	52	” I ground out . “
86844	86845	86834	86842	the only one left who would n’t lecture me	1388	” “
86848	86865	86866	86866	I	52	” she said , kicking the broken lamp and stepping over a piece of broken glass . “
86874	86875	86866	86866	I	52	” “
86881	86888	86866	86866	I	52	” I said with a smirk . “
86905	86906	86903	86903	me	52	” “
86916	86917	86903	86903	me	52	” “
86922	86933	86903	86903	me	52	” she said as I followed her into the kitchen . “
86939	86940	86903	86903	me	52	” “
86945	86949	86903	86903	me	52	” She snorted . “
86957	86988	86989	86989	Yum	178	” I leaned heavily against the counter as she popped open the Grey Goose and downed it straight , like a lady . She smacked her lips together and shivered . “
86991	86995	86989	86989	Yum	178	” she muttered . “
87000	87001	86997	86998	a chaser	1391	” “
87009	87031	87003	87003	I	52	” I grinned and swept my eyes down her . She held her finger up and wagged it in my face . “
87035	87036	87003	87003	I	52	” “
87043	87072	87003	87003	I	52	” I strode toward her , backing her into the counter . Her nails dug into my T - shirt , and she dragged me hard against her . “
87088	87107	87086	87086	Austin	52	” Her hands slipped under my shirt , and her nails scraped across the waistband of my shorts . “
87114	87115	87109	87109	I	52	” “
87120	87127	87109	87109	I	52	” I snapped . She shrugged . “
87138	87169	87171	87171	you	178	” My hands gripped the back of her thighs and hoisted her onto the countertop . I gasped in pain as my ribs seized under the pressure . Holy fuck ! “
87174	87182	87185	87185	Mags	102	” she asked , her eyes wide . “
87192	87375	87185	87185	Mags	102	” I grabbed her face between my hands and crushed our mouths together . She was still for only a second before returning the kiss . Her legs wrapped around my back , tugging me closer . And I tried to will all the anger I ’d been drowning in into that kiss . Fuck everything else going on in my life . I wanted to forget . I wanted someone to help me forget . But I was n’t forgetting . Because that name still rattled around in my head . The brown hair was n’t red . The blue eyes were n’t brown . Her lips did n’t taste like cherry . She was n’t covered in ink . Her body did n’t match mine . I tried to force it . I did n’t need feelings with Maggie . We never had . I just needed one night . Then , maybe I ’d learn how to move on . Learn how to be as dead inside as Julia was . Here ’s to hoping . Thirty - Four Julia “
87392	87404	87387	87387	I	52	” I pushed my computer back and slumped into the couch . “
87411	87416	87405	87405	You	1393	” Heidi assured me . “
87422	87471	87405	87405	You	1393	” She pointed to the last one I ’d looked at . It was on the first floor with a security plan and a fence with code access to get inside and , and , and … All the features I wanted . Yet none of them fit . “
87480	87481	87474	87474	I	52	” “
87496	87497	87474	87474	I	52	” “
87505	87511	87512	87512	You	1393	” I said at once . “
87531	87597	87517	87517	We	1394	” I still felt bad . Even though it had n’t been very long since everything went down . It did n’t help that I could n’t seem to sleep . Not without nightmares jolting me out of bed in a cold sweat . I was exhausted and had no energy . I wanted this all to be over . Heidi seemed to notice that . “
87619	87627	87612	87612	He	52	” I shot her an appreciative smile . “
87632	87633	87634	87634	I	52	” “
87653	87654	87649	87649	I	52	” “
87657	87722	87649	87649	I	52	” I ’d go for anything that did n’t involve people looking at me with pity . I knew I was pitiful . I did n’t need to see it when everyone looked at me . I might have saved my own life , but I still felt like the victim . And it did n’t help that everyone was treating me like one . “
87725	87788	87649	87649	I	52	” Heidi hopped up and started getting things out for the omelet . I grabbed my computer again and flicked through a few more apartments . Not that anything was jumping out at me . The doorbell rang . My head popped up , and I stared at Heidi with frightened eyes . Fuck , even the doorbell was freaking me out . “
87797	87811	87812	87812	Austin	52	” Heidi said . She went to the door and pulled it open . “
87818	87819	87812	87812	Austin	52	” “
87829	87830	87831	87831	She	47	” “
87834	87835	87831	87831	She	47	” “
87849	87858	87859	87859	Julia	47	” Heidi ’s head swiveled back to me . “
87861	87907	87859	87859	Julia	47	” I breathed in deeply and then stood . Man , I was not looking forward to this again . I did n’t care how persistent Austin was ; I was n’t about to change my mind . Not with things the way they were . “
87912	87931	87859	87859	Julia	47	” I told Heidi . She nodded and brushed my shoulder as she went back into the kitchen . “
87937	87941	87859	87859	Julia	47	” I suggested . “
87959	87982	87953	87953	Jensen	1111	” He pointed his thumb over his shoulder , and I saw Jensen ’s giant truck idling on the street . Strange . “
87988	87996	87953	87953	Jensen	1111	” I asked as we stepped outside . “
88003	88011	87999	87999	I	52	” My head snapped up to him . “
88016	88017	87999	87999	I	52	” “
88060	88074	88056	88056	I	52	” He glanced off for a second , as if arguing with himself . “
88086	88087	88056	88056	I	52	” “
88090	88095	88096	88096	You’re	180	” I said hesitantly . “
88104	88178	88098	88098	you’re	180	” I could n’t keep the disbelief from my voice . Austin had rejected the idea of getting professional help from the start . He ’d never thought it would be helpful or that he needed it or that he even had a problem . He ’d just done whatever he wanted , never really improving . It was almost too good to be true to think that he was actually doing this . “
88184	88202	88181	88181	I	52	” He gestured for us to sit on the outdoor furniture in front of Landon ’s house . “
88224	88225	88220	88220	I	52	” “
88233	88234	88220	88220	I	52	” “
88242	88252	88220	88220	I	52	” I did n’t know how to take that . “
88277	88278	88279	88279	Me	52	” “
88288	88289	88284	88284	you	180	” “
88292	88293	88284	88284	you	180	” “
88296	88306	88307	88307	You	180	” He ran a hand back through his hair . “
88353	88354	88348	88348	I	52	” “
88362	88366	88348	88348	I	52	” He winced . “
88373	88396	88348	88348	I	52	” I braced myself because I had a feeling whatever he was about to say was not something I wanted to hear . “
88402	88409	88410	88410	I	52	” I asked low , worried . “
88443	88451	88452	88452	I	52	” He shook his head in frustration . “
88487	88488	88489	88489	Austin	52	” “
88491	88492	88489	88489	Austin	52	” “
88536	88553	88530	88530	I	52	” He looked like he wanted to reach out for me , but he did n’t . “
88589	88596	88573	88573	I	52	” He shrugged and glanced off . “
88620	88643	88645	88645	me	52	” Tension vibrated through every muscle as I waited for the news , and I did n’t even know what it was . “
88647	88648	88645	88645	me	52	” “
88659	88666	88654	88654	I	52	” I froze and stopped breathing . “
88669	88670	88671	88671	Julia	47	” “
88673	88682	88671	88671	Julia	47	” I shook my head and stood up . “
88689	88690	88687	88687	Austin	52	” “
88697	88710	88687	88687	Austin	52	” he said , running ahead of me to block my path . “
88732	88733	88734	88734	I	52	” “
88738	88742	88734	88734	I	52	” he insisted . “
88750	88751	88734	88734	I	52	” “
88762	88763	88764	88764	I	52	” “
88825	88826	88827	88827	I	52	” “
88834	88862	88865	88865	you	47	” I nearly shrieked . All of that cool , calm I ’d felt toward Austin shattered , and I was left reeling . What the fuck ? “
88880	88890	88875	88875	We	1404	” he said with another well - placed wince . “
88947	88948	88941	88941	I	52	” “
88968	88969	88959	88959	We	1404	” “
89041	89062	89063	89063	I	52	” He reached for me but stopped before his hand met my arm . Then , he regretfully dropped it . “
89117	89118	89103	89103	I	52	” “
89133	89139	89103	89103	I	52	” I said , seething . “
89145	89146	89141	89141	you	47	” “
89180	89181	89170	89171	someone else	1559	” “
89185	89189	89170	89171	someone else	1559	” I spat . “
89196	89200	89192	89192	I	52	” he said . “
89244	89245	89246	89246	Asshole	181	” “
89248	89254	89246	89246	Asshole	181	” I finished for him . “
89280	89281	89284	89284	you	47	” “
89298	89319	89322	89322	I	52	” I asked with a sarcastic bite to my voice . We all knew how well that would fucking work . “
89380	89442	89375	89375	I	52	” I did n’t know what to say to that . I wanted to believe every word he ’d said . I hoped he had all the best intentions , but I ’d been burned so many times . It was hard to stand there and hear him say the same bullshit I ’d heard from my dad … from Dillon . “
89453	89477	89445	89445	I	52	” Austin said . His eyes were so intent on mine that I could n’t pull myself away even if I wanted to . “
89519	89520	89521	89521	Austin	52	” “
89531	89532	89533	89533	I	52	” “
89556	89578	89579	89579	I	52	” He took a step forward and dropped a soft kiss onto the top of my head . He sighed heavily . “
89588	89709	89711	89711	he	1411	” Then , he pulled away from me without a good - bye . It was as if he might never leave if he stayed another moment . I watched Jensen ’s truck barrel down the road , carrying Austin far , far away from here . I was shaken . I did n’t know where to start . Part of me was fucking furious that , after everything , he ’d gone and gotten fucked up and then hooked up with Maggie . But the other part of me was just so happy he was going to get help . He needed it . He really fucking needed it . Heidi ’s head popped out of the front door . “
89715	89716	89711	89711	he	1411	” “
89719	89724	89711	89711	he	1411	” I said distantly . “
89729	89745	89746	89746	Jensen	1111	” I could see Landon standing behind her with a worried expression on his face . “
89753	89754	89746	89746	Jensen	1111	” “
89759	89763	89765	89765	you	1413	” Heidi said . “
89768	89783	89765	89765	you	1413	” Landon asked , coming fully out of the house now . I nodded . “
89794	89795	89787	89787	I	52	” “
89799	89803	89787	89787	I	52	” Landon said . “
89808	89809	89787	89787	I	52	” “
89818	89822	89811	89811	you	1413	” He frowned . “
89827	89828	89811	89811	you	1413	” “
89840	89977	89811	89811	you	1413	” I did n’t give two fucks if Maggie hated me . The feeling was mutual . But I wanted all the fucking facts about what had really happened . I wanted to hold on to my anger and not trust everything he ’d said . It was easier than thinking that maybe , just maybe , Austin had realized his mistakes . Easier than thinking that we might have a shot at this if he really did get the help he needed . Thirty - Five Austin When I ’d asked Jensen to take care of it , I had n’t quite expected this . We were in Malibu , driving up to an enormous and gorgeous rehabilitation facility . It was the best in the country and had the price tag to prove it . “
89990	89994	89982	89982	we	1414	” I said . “
90003	90014	89982	89982	we	1414	” Jensen said as we moved through the gated doors . “
90019	90020	89982	89982	we	1414	” “
90056	90078	90049	90049	You	1417	” It was on brand with the Wrights . Jensen did what he could to protect the family and the company . “
90083	90100	90101	90102	Mr. Wright	1111	” The car stopped in front of the giant building , and we were brought inside . “
90104	90112	90101	90102	Mr. Wright	1111	” a man said , approaching us . “
90117	90125	90115	90115	Austin	52	” I said , shaking his hand . “
90132	90133	90127	90127	you	1111	” “
90138	90139	90140	90140	I	52	” “
90170	90185	90157	90157	we	1418	” Villa ? I raised my eyebrows at Jensen , and he just shrugged . “
90235	90236	90216	90216	We	1418	” “
90239	90248	90249	90249	You	1111	” I said skeptically . The man laughed . “
90292	90309	90275	90275	your	1111	” When Jensen realized I was n’t going to say anything , he smiled at Bartholomew . “
90320	90321	90314	90314	I	52	” “
90329	90429	90430	90430	I	52	” Bartholomew asked me , ignoring Jensen and staring at me straight in the face . Did I ? Fuck . I wanted to say , Yes . I wanted to say , Of course . I wanted to say so many things . But the truth was , the thought of professional help scared the shit out of me . What if I was a lost cause ? What if , despite the six thousand dollars a week that Jensen was going to fork over for this insane rehab center , I could n’t get my shit together ? “
90436	90448	90430	90430	I	52	” I finally said . Bartholomew nodded with a kind smile . “
90463	90814	90455	90455	We	1424	” Julia Austin had n’t slept with Maggie . I ’d actually made that phone call even though I was terrified to . I ’d thought that maybe he ’d told me to call Maggie as a bluff . He had n’t thought I ’d actually call her . But , hey , I ’d pulled a gun on my ex - boyfriend . One phone call could n’t be that bad . Maggie had admitted that he had stopped at a kiss , that he ’d gotten all mopey about me and then tried to apologize for using her . She ’d laughed , as if she was using him . Then , she ’d threatened me within an inch of my life if I ever called her again and hung up on me . But I believed him now . Did n’t make him inviting her over or that kiss any better . But he ’d been honest . It was a step in the right direction . Even if I was n’t ready for a relationship … and had no clue if I ever would be again . He ’d found the honest bone in his body and then fucking left . He ’d really , really left . Landon told me that he was at some ritzy rehab center in California with security that even paparazzi could n’t get through . The program he was in required no outside contact for the first thirty days . He ’d start family therapy after that , and Landon was excited to get to go to California and see him . I was sure he was also interested in taking a vacation , but I did n’t say it . Not that I was checking up on Austin or anything . Okay , maybe a little . It was really quiet around here without him . But I was kind of glad that I had time to process . Plus , it helped that , two weeks after Austin left , I finally found the most perfect apartment ever . “
90826	90836	90815	90815	I	52	” I told Heidi and Landon on moving day . “
90851	90855	90815	90815	I	52	” Landon grunted . “
90860	90868	90815	90815	I	52	” I said , jumping into action . “
90876	90880	90874	90874	someone	1561	” Heidi said . “
90889	90893	90896	90897	poor baby	1429	” Landon grumbled . “
90899	90903	90896	90897	poor baby	1429	” Heidi cooed . “
90924	90931	90896	90897	poor baby	1429	” Patrick groaned . Heidi laughed . “
90937	90943	90896	90897	poor baby	1429	” Morgan wrinkled her nose . “
90957	90958	90959	90959	She	269	” “
90963	90981	90959	90959	She	269	” I asked in shock . I ran my back into the doorframe and dropped the couch . “
90984	90985	90959	90959	She	269	” “
91014	91018	91012	91012	Jason	71	” Morgan said . “
91021	91025	91028	91028	she	269	” I muttered . “
91031	91045	91046	91046	Julia	48	” Morgan shook her head and glanced away . Eesh . That bad . “
91050	91315	91046	91046	Julia	48	” Patrick grumbled . Somehow , I felt more like I was part of the Wright family than ever despite the fact that Austin was gone . I did n’t know if they were doing it out of obligation because of him or if they just liked me , but I was grateful . It was hard not to feel loved when these amazing people reached out to me . Jensen , Emery , and Sutton showed up when we were already almost finished with my old apartment . I did n’t have that much stuff . Especially after burning half of my clothes , including that damn bomber jacket . Sutton looked like a hollowed - out version of herself . Since Mav had died a month earlier , she ’d lost at least ten pounds . Her cheekbones jutted out of her face , and her dress hung off of her . She did n’t say much , just started picking up small boxes and taking them to the moving truck . By the time we done unloading at my new studio apartment downtown , it was lunchtime . The selling point of the place was that it had the gorgeous space for my art . And I figured , if Austin was getting the help he needed , then I was going to help myself , too . Sutton came to stand at my side in the art studio . All I had in there were a few boxes of supplies and an easel . She stared at the blank easel . “
91322	91347	91348	91348	I	52	” she asked . I turned to face her , but she was n’t looking at me . She was somewhere very far away . “
91358	91359	91367	91367	he	1666	” “
91370	91383	91367	91367	he	1666	” She finally met my eyes with her sad , sorrowful ones . “
91416	91420	91421	91421	I	52	” She sighed . “
91445	91494	91495	91495	Austin	1597	” I watched her retreating back with a rapidly growing ache in my chest . Sutton had firsthand experience in the matter , and it had drastically changed her from the silliest of the entire Wright bunch to … the wisest . And her words were wise . Austin “
91497	91516	91517	91517	Man	52	” Morgan said with a huge smile . She threw her arms around me and squeezed me tight . “
91538	91545	91546	91546	I	52	” I laughed and released Morgan . “
91554	91555	91546	91546	I	52	” “
91560	91578	91556	91556	You	52	” Landon said . We clapped hands , and then he pulled me in for a hug . “
91584	91607	91610	91610	sis	1437	” I told him . They were all here . In California . Jensen , Landon , Morgan , and even Sutton . “
91612	91657	91610	91610	sis	1437	” I said , pulling my little sister toward me . She was a shell of her former self . I could n’t believe how tiny she was . She ’d never been a big girl , but now , she was a rail . “
91677	91683	91672	91672	he	1439	” She cracked a smile . “
91699	91709	91693	91693	We	1441	” Jensen reached out and shook my hand last . “
91725	91726	91730	91730	you	1437	” “
91732	91860	91862	91862	Patrick	1597	” It had grown on me . In the month I ’d been here , I ’d started to love the Malibu center . The first week at least , I ’d hated it . Well , I ’d hated everything and everyone . Detoxing my body from all the alcohol I ’d consumed over the years was more painful than I ’d ever imagined . I was right when I ’d thought that going cold turkey would kill me . It probably would have without the right people looking over me . But , now , I was into the actual rehabilitation part . That also meant , visitors . Eventually maybe even approved weekend trips , but I was n’t going to hold my breath . “
91864	91868	91869	91869	He	1597	” I asked . “
91875	91879	91880	91880	He	1597	” Morgan said . “
91893	91897	91898	91898	You	1557	” I laughed . “
91909	91910	91911	91911	He	1557	” “
91922	91923	91928	91928	Julia	48	” “
91930	92011	92012	92012	She	48	” I managed to get out . I ’d talked about Julia a lot in therapy . Thought about how I ’d treated her , how I felt about her , where to go from here . Not that therapy gave anyone answers . Just a hell of a lot more things to think about . And Julia was constantly on my mind . All of my siblings were stone - cold silent though . Finally , Landon spoke up , “
92027	92028	92017	92017	She	48	” “
92034	92038	92029	92029	She	48	” Sutton finished . “
92044	92045	92046	92046	She	48	” “
92050	92055	92046	92046	She	48	” I asked hopefully . “
92064	92065	92061	92061	she	48	” “
92068	92102	92061	92061	she	48	” I supposed that was a start . I did n’t expect her to ever forgive me … or even miss me . So , if she did , I ’d take it . “
92114	92208	92109	92109	I	52	” I took my siblings on a tour of the facility . If I were n’t here for rehab , I would think this was a resort . It had heated pools and private tennis courts , a spa , horseback riding , and even a fully equipped art studio . I would have loved to show that to Julia . If I had an artistic bone in my body , I would take some classes . But I ’d leave that to her . Morgan leaned forward on the balcony and yawned . “
92221	92222	92223	92223	I	52	” “
92226	92227	92223	92223	I	52	” “
92234	92235	92223	92223	I	52	” “
92243	92270	92271	92271	We	1447	” Being isolated meant that I did n’t know anything that was going on in the world and even less about the company . She frowned . “
92302	92303	92296	92296	he	105	” “
92326	92327	92328	92328	You	1445	” “
92333	92334	92328	92328	You	1445	” “
92342	92350	92336	92336	I	52	” I laughed and shook my head . “
92375	92376	92360	92360	I	52	” “
92397	92433	92393	92393	Jensen	1111	” I shrugged and leaned forward . Jensen , Landon , and Sutton had gotten into suits and were hanging out by the pool . Maybe they needed this visit as much as I did . “
92478	92479	92486	92486	you	1449	” “
92491	92505	92486	92486	you	1449	” she teased . She poked me in my finally - healed ribs . “
92515	92516	92518	92518	me	52	” “
92520	92521	92522	92522	I	52	” “

92536	92540	92522	92522	I	52	” I suggested . “
92552	92553	92554	92554	I	52	” “
92566	92572	92560	92560	I	52	” Morgan arched an eyebrow . “
92579	92580	92560	92560	I	52	” “
92650	92657	92648	92648	Morgan	64	” I turned to face her . “
92669	92670	92665	92665	I	52	” “
92683	92684	92665	92665	I	52	” “
92703	92712	92698	92698	I	52	” We both stared down at the pool . “
92727	92749	92698	92698	I	52	” I asked . Morgan stepped back into my villa , as if debating on what she was going to do . “
92755	92756	92698	92698	I	52	” “
92766	92767	92768	92768	Austin	48	” “
92770	92771	92768	92768	Austin	48	” “
92774	92775	92768	92768	Austin	48	” “
92789	92801	92768	92768	Austin	48	” I smiled . I ’d thought about that a lot . “
92809	93209	92768	92768	Austin	48	” Thirty - Six Julia My hands were covered in paint . Drop cloth obscured the hardwood floor of my studio . Canvas took up every open space . It was perfect . A messy perfection . Just like me . Something had taken over me ever since I moved in . I could n’t stop painting , drawing , sketching . I ’d even tried my hands at sculpting . Art infused my body and my mind . It made my soul sing . It was like I ’d found my muse . My eyes moved to the only one hundred percent finished painting in the whole room . It was the naked picture of Austin I ’d painted in art class this summer . Nina had called me to come pick it up even though I was n’t taking any more classes . She ’d been impressed with my work and asked me to come back . She ’d introduced me to the art community in Lubbock . And , suddenly , I ’d come alive . I had a naked muse in my studio and a group of people encouraging my art in a way I never had before . It felt right . Wright even . The doorbell rang , and I actually did n’t jump . I ’d destroyed a few good paintings that way . But art had become my therapy . With it , I was finally de - stressing , post - Dillon . I wiped my hands off the best I could on a red towel and then gave up . I was in leggings and a tank top that used to be white before I covered it in paint . My hairdresser , Lisa , had dyed my hair into a rose - gold ombré , so it was lighter on the top before it faded out into the red I ’d had for so long . I liked the new look . Not that anyone could see it in the messy bun I had on the top of my head . I looked out the peephole and did n’t see anyone there . After deactivating the security system and unlocking the door , I pulled it open . I warily looked around before realizing there was a giant box on my doorstep . My eyes rounded in confusion . “
93213	93279	93280	93280	Jesus	67	” I had n’t ordered anything . I checked the shipping address . It was from somewhere in California . Huh . It was n’t heavy when I kicked it inside . I found a pair of scissors in a drawer in my coffee table and tore into the packing tape . The box was covered from top to bottom in little green Styrofoam peanuts . “
93282	93978	93280	93280	Jesus	67	” I muttered . I dug my hand in , up to my elbow , before I came across whatever was in the box . I wrapped my fingers around something soft and tugged . In a shower of peanuts came a shiny pink - sequined unicorn with a ribbon tied around its neck and a letter attached to it . I burst into laughter when I saw Waffle . I ’d known that the unicorn had ended up at Austin ’s house , but I ’d thought he ’d just forgotten about it . And maybe about me , too . He ’d been able to have outside communication for three weeks , but he had n’t reached out to me . With excitement that I could n’t explain , I plucked the letter off of Waffle ’s neck and placed our unicorn on my kitchen island . I ripped open the envelope and stared down at the neat print of Austin ’s handwriting . Dear Julia , I ’ve wanted to write to you every day that I ’ve been here , but my therapist and I agreed that it was better for you to have space . I ’d asked you not to forget me , yet I had to give you room to if you chose . So , in the event that you continue to want nothing to do with me , feel free to stop reading and throw this in the trash . I ’m going to assume … or maybe just hope that you ’re still reading . If that ’s the case , here ’s your damn unicorn . Waffle got me through the hardest parts of detox . But , since we share custody , I thought it only appropriate that you got her for a while . That way , I stop getting jabs from my brothers about having a pink - sequined unicorn in my room . Why the snail mail ? I ’m sure you ’re probably wondering . I could have called you or emailed or whatever . You could come visit even . But , strangely enough , I found that I can articulate how I ’m feeling best when I write things down . I apologize for my penmanship in advance . Anyway , all I really want to say is that I ’m sorry . I took you for granted and did n’t listen to you or appreciate you . If I could go back , I ’d fix things . But I do n’t have that ability . I have to accept that I hurt you and that what I did might be irreversible . But … if there ’s maybe a small chance that you might be willing to meet a new Austin Wright — not perfect but maybe better — I’d be the luckiest guy in the world . If that ’s something you are interested in , then write me back . You can send it to the address on the envelope , and it ’ll get to me . I ’ll be anxiously awaiting your letter . And , if I do n’t get one , then … I understand . Still yours , Austin I read the letter three times . Each time , my smile grew bigger and bigger . After the last time , I found my own piece of paper and started writing . Austin Julia ’s letter showed up three days after the package was delivered . It had taken fifteen different sheets of paper before I got the wording right on mine , and even then , I ’d thought it sucked . I had n’t wanted to send it . And , at the same time , I ’d been dying to send it . I thought I had been more worried that she ’d ignore me . I would n’t have blamed her , but a guy had to have hope . Dear Austin , I might be interested in a new Austin Wright . Just not totally new . Maybe one more like that guy who “
93980	94531	94532	94532	I	52	” me Waffle in the first place . Or who walked me through the First Friday Art Trail . Have you seen him lately ? I ’m glad you ’re in therapy . I ’ve had my own brand of therapy . Found a muse , which is nice because I converted a bedroom in my new apartment into an art studio . Finding my art again … you know ? Waffle likes the studio , too . She might not be just pink anymore . Anyway , I talked to Maggie . I do n’t think you actually expected me to , but I did . So , I believe you . I ’m still upset about what happened . That anything happened at all . Maybe my moral high ground should say that I have no right to be upset , considering we were broken up at the time , but that does n’t stop me from feeling it . I want to move past that , but even after talking to her and her yelling at me about you , I still feel panic at the thought of you two . Phew . Okay , had to get that off my chest . I do n’t know where this leaves us . Maybe I do n’t have to figure it out right now . Write me again , and I ’ll keep thinking about it . Julia P.S. I like the snail mail , and your handwriting does n’t totally suck . I answered that letter . And the next . And the one after that . Every three days , I had a letter from Julia . I thought we ’d talked more in the weeks I was away than we had when we were together . Without her sexy body in front of me and the weight of the alcohol abuse clouding everything , I found that I always had something to say to her . The fact that I had n’t just picked up a phone or emailed or flown her out to see me made the anticipation so much more intense . No instant gratification in that . With each passing day , I ached for her more and more . Ached for her like I had n’t known was possible . But I had a long way to go . Another month of rehab before I could even get out of California . Who knew what would happen when I was finally back in Lubbock ? All I knew was that I ’d do anything to make up for what had happened with Julia . One of the things that the center really pushed was family therapy days . It helped the therapist connect to the entire situation . And mine was always trying to get to the root of the problem . What had caused me to be this way ? I insisted I had always been this way . He smiled and assured me that I did n’t come out of the womb as an alcoholic . It might run in my family , but that did n’t mean I had to succumb to it . We were in one of those sessions when Jensen leaned back in his chair . “
94551	94552	94553	94553	You	1453	” “
94560	94577	94553	94553	You	1453	” Sutton whispered . Her voice was as light as a feather caught in the wind . “
94580	94591	94592	94592	I	52	” I said , angling away from that particular conversation . “
94603	94604	94592	94592	I	52	” “
94613	94633	94611	94611	Austin	48	” my therapist said . He pointed his pen toward me , as if to say , Go on . “

94649	94653	94654	94654	Me	52	” Morgan said . “
94657	94677	94654	94654	Me	52	” Landon admitted . My eyes found Jensen ’s in a panic . He nodded and patted my back . “
94693	94699	94687	94687	We	1456	” I swallowed and nodded . “
94766	94802	94763	94763	I	52	” I reached for the glass of water in front of me and took a long drink . I was off on a tangent . That was n’t what they wanted to know about anyway . “
94824	94832	94821	94821	you	1460	” I said , gesturing to Jensen , “
94840	94841	94834	94834	I	52	” “
94845	94849	94842	94842	I	52	” he said . “

94924	94929	94908	94909	five children	1461	” the therapist said . “
94933	94973	94974	94974	I	52	” My siblings nodded . I could see that they were all remembering their version of what had happened after Mom died . Jensen had taken over . Life had gone on , but it was never the same . “

95046	95051	95044	95044	Austin	48	” Morgan said softly . “

95182	95187	95188	95188	I	52	” the therapist continued . “
95208	95223	95197	95197	I	52	” I said , as if that memory had just dropped into my mind . “
95241	95242	95197	95197	I	52	” “
95245	95249	95197	95197	I	52	” I muttered . “

95304	95335	95336	95336	I	52	” Morgan said . Sutton ’s eyes were red , and she was looking down at her hands . She looked like she might burst into tears at any point . “
95341	95345	95336	95336	I	52	” Jensen said . “

95391	95761	95382	95382	we	1470	” I looked around at my family in shock . Deep down , I ’d known that Mom ’s and Dad ’s deaths had affected me , but I had n’t ever wanted to believe that I was drinking to cover up that hurt . Now that it was in front of me , it felt like a hurdle I could overcome . And maybe it would help all of the Wrights to finally deal with it . Julia Dillon ’s trial had been moved up . I ’d been dreading this day for a long three months . But I was also glad that I could deal with this before Austin got back . I kept his last letter in my pocket through the entire ordeal . Dear Julia , You are the strongest person I ’ve ever met . I ca n’t imagine how it must feel to testify against Dillon , but if anyone can do it , for a second time , then you can . You held him at gunpoint in your apartment . You got away from him twice . You can do this . My only regret is that I ca n’t be there , too . I ’d be the best moral support you could ask for . I ’ll be thinking about you , worrying over you , anxiously awaiting another letter to find out how it went . I have faith that the judge will make the right decision . Counting down the days until I see you again . Always yours , Austin Having his words with me helped . Dillon was a shadow of himself after spending three months behind bars again . He looked like a wreck . And that helped , too . When the jury came back and found him guilty , I nearly stood up and cheered . The judge gave him thirty years in prison for a laundry list of crimes . And , just like that , I was free . Finally free . Heidi and Emery were waiting for me when I left the courtroom . They threw their arms around me , jumping up and down at the victory . “
95767	95771	95764	95764	you	1471	” Heidi asked . “

95834	95847	95829	95829	I	52	” I bit my lip and pulled out the letter from Austin . “
95855	95865	95848	95848	I	52	” Heidi and Emery shared one of their looks . “
95873	95877	95868	95868	he	1275	” Heidi asked . “
95888	95905	95868	95868	he	1275	” Emery added . I let them read the letter , and they both sighed dramatically . “
95916	95921	95923	95923	he	1275	” Heidi read aloud . “
95933	95934	95927	95927	Jesus	67	” “
95941	95962	95963	95963	He	1275	” I said , finally admitting the feeling that had been building in me over the last couple of weeks . “
95984	95988	95989	95989	We	1475	” Heidi asked . “
96003	96004	96001	96001	we	1475	” “
96017	96021	96024	96024	Heidi	594	” Heidi asked . “
96029	96033	96024	96024	Heidi	594	” Emery muttered . “
96045	96046	96024	96024	Heidi	594	” “
96066	96070	96061	96061	her	594	” I laughed . “

96081	96091	96071	96071	You	1471	” Heidi smacked Emery ’s ass and grinned wickedly . “
96094	96098	96101	96101	Julia	48	” Emery groaned . “
96103	96107	96101	96101	Julia	48	” Heidi prodded . “
96136	96609	96610	96610	Julia	48	” Thirty - Seven Austin I left rehab with one suitcase and a box of letters . It had been the longest ninety days of my life , yet … it had flown by . I ’d been skeptical when I first arrived . How could ninety days change my life ? But it had . In more ways than I could even articulate . For the first time in a decade , my thoughts were clear . I had a foundation to continue my path and grow into the person I ’d always wanted to be . Instead of the drunk I ’d become . I still had a lot to make up for . Relationships that I ’d splintered , work that I ’d neglected , and trust I needed to build up again . But one step forward . One step at a time . Jensen had sent the private jet to pick me up from the facility , and I flew from Malibu to my home alone . In some way , it was fitting . I might have shown up to rehab with Jensen , but my road to recovery had been a long one , and I ’d had to do it all by myself . After all my time away , I needed to prove I could return home on my own , too . The plane touched down at Lubbock International Airport in the middle of the afternoon on the day before Halloween . After months with an oceanside vista , Lubbock looked flat as a pancake and lifeless . Yet … it was home . This was the longest I ’d been away since that one summer I was an intern in California . Apparently , California was the place I got away . Not that I was in any hurry to get out of here again . I carried the box of letters off the plane and was handed my suitcase after disembarking . My eyes flickered over the empty tarmac in disappointment . I ’d thought one of my siblings would have at least come to get me . I ’d been gone for three months ! Then , I heard an engine revving behind me . I whirled around and found my shiny red Alfa Romeo idling . Fuck , I ’d missed that car . It had been weird , not driving . I was more than ready to get behind the wheel and take off . I laughed and headed for the car . Man , it was good to be home . I had almost made it to the driver ’s side when the door popped open , and out came a vision . The girl I ’d been dreaming about seeing for three very long months . “
96612	96713	96716	96716	Austin	48	” I said in awe . I drank her in . She ’d changed her hair . It was lighter and shone in the fading afternoon sun . And that was n’t the only change . She looked … happier . A coy smile touched her lips , and her dark eyes lit up . She was in black skinny jeans and a black V - neck T - shirt that hugged her curvy features . Paint smudged her fingers . It looked like it belonged there . And she was still the most beautiful woman I ’d ever seen . “
96718	96719	96716	96716	Austin	48	” “
96726	96737	96738	96738	You	48	” I asked with a raised eyebrow . She laughed . “
96743	96744	96738	96738	You	48	” “
96750	96751	96754	96754	she	48	” “
96766	96772	96760	96760	I	52	” She patted the roof . “
96779	96780	96760	96760	I	52	” “
96787	96796	96783	96783	I	52	” I said , stepping up to her . “
96801	96808	96783	96783	I	52	” Her eyes twinkled in delight . “
96812	96813	96783	96783	I	52	” “
96820	96854	96783	96783	I	52	” I set the letters down on my suitcase and left it behind as I approached Julia . She leaned back against the car and tilted her head up to look at me . “
96863	96864	96783	96783	I	52	” “
96871	96872	96867	96867	your	48	” “
96882	96883	96875	96875	I	52	” “
96890	96894	96895	96895	I	52	” I nodded . “
96917	96918	96919	96919	You	48	” “
96927	96936	96919	96919	You	48	” she asked , worry in her voice . “
96947	96948	96949	96949	I	52	” “
96954	97082	96949	96949	I	52	” God , I wanted to kiss her . I wanted to feel her lips against mine and taste that cherry flavor and get lost in her . I wanted so much . But we had n’t made any promises in all of our letters . I had n’t even known that she ’d be the one picking me up today . It had been a long game of waiting to find out if she ’d forgive me for what had happened . Not forget it because no one could forget , but learn to move forward . I ’d done all of this for me , but I ’d be lying if I said I did n’t hope that it ’d helped my chances with Julia . “
97091	97115	97116	97116	I	52	” I told her instead . I was n’t going to press . If she wanted this , she ’d let me know . “
97126	97138	97119	97119	I	52	” Then , her eyes rounded , and she started laughing . “
97146	97190	97140	97140	you	1478	” I whipped around and saw that the wind had carried my suitcase and the precious box of letters away from me . I dashed after it and scooped them both up . Julia was cracking up , laughing , when I returned . “
97199	97200	97140	97140	you	1478	” “
97208	97234	97235	97235	I	52	” She leaned down into the car to pop the trunk , and I placed my suitcase inside and fit the letters next to it . “
97241	97253	97235	97235	I	52	” she said when I came back around to the front . “
97258	97290	97291	97291	I	52	” She tossed Waffle at me . I caught the pink - sequined unicorn in both hands and stared at the designs that Julia had added to our unicorn love child . “
97318	97319	97314	97316	a neglectful parent	1480	” “
97326	97327	97314	97316	a neglectful parent	1480	” “
97335	97339	97314	97316	a neglectful parent	1480	” she asked . “
97346	97347	97348	97348	You	1478	” “
97351	97355	97348	97348	You	1478	” she gasped . “
97362	97363	97348	97348	You	1478	” “
97374	97380	97364	97364	I	52	” Her eyes were wide . “
97386	97387	97388	97388	I	52	” “
97434	97435	97420	97420	I	52	” “
97438	97442	97420	97420	I	52	” she whispered . “
97449	97453	97420	97420	I	52	” I laughed . “
97511	97512	97502	97502	I	52	” “
97520	97521	97522	97522	Jensen	1111	” “
97530	97534	97522	97522	Jensen	1111	” She nodded . “
97550	97556	97544	97544	her	1478	” My eyes met hers . “
97561	97775	97544	97544	her	1478	” Julia ’s cheeks heated . She knew I did n’t really mean the car . We both got inside , and I turned over the engine . It purred to life . Then , I was pulling away from the airport and off onto the country back roads that would take me into Lubbock . The windows were rolled down , Julia ’s hair whipped in the wind , and it was a perfect sort of freedom . How had I taken this for granted before ? I had my car , my girl , and my freaking unicorn . Maybe I could have a life again . We pulled up to Jensen ’s house , and I parked in the driveway . I still did n’t know what I thought about my decision to stay with Jensen . I loved my brother , and he had a freaking mansion , but it was n’t my place . I knew it was the right decision to get rid of the house . It was not the best place for me right now . Especially considering the last time I ’d been in it and what had happened . I did n’t want those memories . It definitely would n’t assist my recovery . “
97783	97823	97829	97829	mine	52	” Julia said . She grabbed the box where I kept all of her letters . It popped open when she adjusted it in her hands . Then , she froze , and a slow grin stretched her face . “
97831	97832	97829	97829	mine	52	” “
97843	97850	97834	97834	you	52	” I asked . She shrugged . “
97856	97857	97858	97858	They	1483	” “
97905	97909	97914	97915	Your therapist	2247	” Julia laughed . “
97920	97921	97922	97922	He	52	” “
97932	97938	97922	97922	He	52	” I paused before adding , “
97946	98028	98029	98029	I	52	” She smiled shyly , as if this were the first time I ’d ever said something like that to her before . She touched my arm just briefly . I wondered what she was thinking . Was I pushing her ? Going too fast ? I felt like I was going slower than our snail mail . I did n’t want to fall back into old habits , but I would do anything to crash into her all over again . “
98037	98093	98029	98029	I	52	” she finally said . Then , she turned to walk through the front door . A thrill ran through me . I felt like she was slowly acknowledging where this was going . When I followed her through the front door , suitcase in hand , my heart nearly beat out of my chest . “
98097	98448	98450	98450	y’	1487	” the roomful of people cheered . She whirled around to stare at me with her mouth open and hand over her heart , as if to say that she had n’t known either . I laughed and dropped the suitcase as I took in the scene before me in awe . A giant Welcome Home sign was slung from one side of the living room to the other . Blue and green streamers hung from the fan way up above . A sheet cake was on a table in the center of the room with Welcome Home , Austin ! in big blue and green letters . A handprint took up one side , and I noticed that Jensen ’s son , Colton , had icing on his face . And the best part of all , of course , was that my entire wonderful family was all together . Jensen had his arm around Emery , trying to restrain Colton . Kimber and Noah were standing together , holding a sleeping Bethany . Lilyanne was laughing at Colton ’s face , and I suspected she might have had something to do with it . Landon and Heidi were lounging on the couch with giant smiles on their faces . Patrick stood by Morgan . Neither of them looked as if they ’d admit that they were drawn together . Next to Morgan , I was surprised to see the new CFO , David Calloway , in attendance . I supposed anyone that high up in the company was now a member of the Wright family . I had n’t seen him since the Fourth of July when he was interviewed , but we ’d been so caught up with Maverick ’s death that I did n’t get that much time with him . Then , my eyes landed on Sutton . She was still a shadow of her former self , and I knew no amount of therapy would help her with Maverick ’s death . Her only link to her husband was toddling around at her ankles . “
98462	98469	98450	98450	y’	1487	” I said to the crowd . “
98478	98482	98470	98470	We	1488	” Jensen said . “
98500	98501	98502	98502	I	52	” “
98518	98523	98524	98524	I	52	” I assured them . “
98533	98617	98524	98524	I	52	” I hurried up the steps and found the guest bedroom . I stashed the suitcase in a corner and then sank onto the bed . Fuck , I loved having everyone together , but fear crept through me . Events like this had always involved alcohol . Not that they would now , but … it was hard not to worry . Not to wonder . I ’d prepared myself for this kind of thing . But it was a bit much . “
98622	98632	98633	98633	You	52	” Julia said , leaning into the guest bedroom . “
98636	98654	98633	98633	You	52	” I opened my mouth to tell her that I was fine . But I was n’t . “
98660	98661	98633	98633	You	52	” “
98686	98706	98676	98676	They	1492	” She set the box of letters down on a dresser and then came to sit next to me . “
98736	98737	98738	98738	You	52	” “
98769	98781	98783	98783	you	52	” she said , reaching out and threading our fingers together . “
98797	99028	99029	99029	I	52	” My eyes bore into hers with all the intensity from our time apart . She bit her lip and then glanced down at my mouth . I was about to respond when she leaned forward and pressed her lips against mine . It was tentative at first . As if she could n’t believe she had done it in the first place . Then , her hand knotted in my shirt , and she pulled me closer . My hands went into her hair , and I cupped her face . Every day that I ’d spent without her , I pushed into that kiss . Fear that I ’d lost her forever . Regret that I ’d probably deserved it . Hope that she ’d changed her mind . Despair that I had n’t thought she would . Lust … so much lust . And more … so much more . I did n’t want to ever stop kissing her . She tasted like cherry and turned my world upside down . The way she used her tongue heated my blood . Her body under my practiced hands sent shivers up her skin . This was paradise . Nothing more than that one perfect kiss . When she finally drew back , pink - cheeked and breathless , she smiled and dropped another hasty kiss on my lips . “
99041	99042	99029	99029	I	52	” “
99045	99055	99029	99029	I	52	” I admitted , just as short on breath . “
99063	99064	99065	99065	I	52	” “
99089	99090	99093	99093	Austin	48	” “
99095	99111	99093	99093	Austin	48	” She leaned her forehead against mine . Our breath mingled in the short distance . “
99140	99141	99093	99093	Austin	48	” “
99145	99146	99147	99147	You	52	” “
99157	99169	99171	99171	I	52	” she said , pulling back to look into my eyes . “
99186	99187	99188	99188	I	52	” “
99202	99203	99196	99196	I	52	” “
99211	99212	99206	99206	we	1495	” “
99226	99227	99228	99228	I	52	” “
99296	99297	99287	99287	I	52	” “
99311	99323	99309	99309	Julia	48	” I assured her , pulling her in for another kiss . “
99330	99335	99309	99309	Julia	48	” Thirty - Eight Julia “
99346	99396	99336	99336	I	52	” Austin said . We ’d just pulled up in front of Sutton ’s house . He got out of the car and tugged on the Captain America T - shirt I ’d gotten him for Halloween when I went out that morning , looking for something to wear . “
99409	99413	99414	99414	I	52	” He laughed . “
99427	99428	99431	99431	you	52	” “
99434	99439	99431	99431	you	52	” I droned sarcastically . “
99459	99494	99452	99452	he	1497	” His eyes scanned the black leather pantsuit I ’d stuffed my body into . It all fit once everything was in place , but it ’d been ridiculous , getting to that moment . “
99510	99523	99524	99525	Captain America	197	” He laughed as we walked up to Sutton ’s front door . “
99530	99531	99524	99525	Captain America	197	” “
99535	99548	99524	99525	Captain America	197	” I knocked on the door , and I heard Sutton yell , “
99551	99594	99524	99525	Captain America	197	” She pulled open the door to the house she and Maverick had lived in together . I could n’t believe that she still lived here with all the memories . Or maybe she just could n’t let go of it yet . “
99603	99607	99524	99525	Captain America	197	” Sutton said . “
99643	99644	99636	99636	he	71	” “
99652	99727	99645	99645	We	1502	” I said , pulling Austin inside . We ’d volunteered to walk Jason around the neighborhood with Sutton for Halloween . I ’d known that she needed the company and that it would be hard for Austin to come right back to life in Lubbock on a party night . Halloween had always been a night to get wasted unless you had kids . So , the whole thing worked out for us . “
99741	99750	99730	99730	I	52	” Austin said . Sutton waved him off . “
99776	99801	99804	99804	he	1504	” She disappeared into one of the bedrooms and appeared a few minutes later with Jason decked out in a bright yellow Minion costume . “
99808	99835	99804	99804	he	1504	” I gushed . Jason ’s eyes lit up when he saw Austin and me . He toddled over to Austin and held his hands up . “
99838	99879	99804	99804	he	1504	” Austin laughed and pulled Jason into his arms . Seeing them like that made my heart swell . But one look at Sutton ’s face , and I saw all the happy what - ifs flash before her eyes . “
99887	99891	99892	99892	Your	1504	” I suggested . “
99899	99903	99897	99897	Julia	48	” Sutton said . “
99919	99920	99897	99897	Julia	48	” “
99937	99941	99897	99897	Julia	48	” I suggested . “
99949	99962	99944	99944	I	52	” She turned away from us and took a steadying deep breath . “
99969	100082	100083	100083	He	1508	” She got out Jason ’s stroller filled with goodies for him and a bag for the candy , and then we were off . Jason made it through three whole houses before being too tuckered out to walk . Austin threw him up onto his shoulders from there , and Jason squealed in delight at the attention . This was how it was supposed to be . This was how an uncle was supposed to act with his nephew . By the time we made it to the last house on the street , Jason was fast asleep in the stroller with a bagful of candy that he ’d never eat . “
100092	100096	100083	100083	He	1508	” Sutton said . “
100109	100113	100099	100099	he	1508	” I said . “
100126	100141	100142	100142	I	52	” Sutton got Jason into bed before coming back out to the living room . “
100166	100167	100154	100154	I	52	” “
100170	100174	100154	100154	I	52	” Austin said , “
100197	100198	100193	100193	You	1511	” “
100208	100212	100213	100213	I	52	” I said . “
100256	100260	100240	100240	I	52	” She sighed . “
100266	100267	100240	100240	I	52	” “
100270	100274	100240	100240	I	52	” I said . “
100282	100299	100275	100275	You	1511	” Sutton beamed at that . At this point , it was all she really had . “
100320	100342	100311	100311	I	52	” We laughed and nodded before leaving Sutton ’s house . Both of us sagged as soon as the door closed . “
100348	100352	100353	100353	I	52	” I admitted . “
100367	100368	100360	100360	I	52	” “
100379	100380	100374	100374	she	1513	” “
100392	100398	100374	100374	she	1513	” I nodded my head . “
100401	100402	100374	100374	she	1513	” “
100413	100423	100374	100374	she	1513	” Austin said as we walked to his car . “
100435	100440	100427	100427	we	1514	” I suggested hesitantly . “
100446	100450	100427	100427	we	1514	” he said . “
100455	100456	100427	100427	we	1514	” “
100464	100598	100427	100427	we	1514	” I tried not to second - guess inviting him into my personal space . I wanted him there . I wanted us to work . It was almost a little scary , how easy it was to be with him again . Almost as if his absence had made me fall for him even harder . Not to mention , there was the box of letters I had in my apartment . Those had brought us together more than anything else ever had . And I loved exploring the man those letters had helped me find . We made it to my apartment fifteen minutes later . I quickly turned off the security system and then reactivated it once we were inside . Austin was quiet as he surveyed my new place . “
100601	100608	100427	100427	we	1514	” I asked self - consciously . “
100623	100624	100617	100617	My	52	” “
100631	100632	100617	100617	My	52	” “
100640	100682	100617	100617	My	52	” He turned to face me . I felt a sudden rush of emotions . Austin was here . In my apartment . We were together . Sober . Three months ago , I never would have thought that was possible . “
100693	100694	100683	100683	You	1517	” “
100702	100736	100700	100700	Jason	71	” Austin said . He took a seat on the couch , and I followed him , sitting next to him . He wrapped an arm around my shoulders and held me close . “
100741	100742	100739	100739	Jason	71	” “
100796	100826	100784	100784	I	52	” It was a sobering thought . He ’d been a high - functioning alcoholic for so long that he definitely missed a lot of those kinds of moments . “
100874	100875	100862	100862	I	52	” “
100882	100883	100862	100862	I	52	” “
100930	100931	100924	100924	I	52	” “
100947	100948	100951	100951	I	52	” “
100972	101070	100963	100963	I	52	” I tilted my head up to meet his dark eyes . There was remorse there . True remorse . What I ’d seen from him in the last two days was n’t an act . Of course , I had n’t thought it was . But seeing him torn up like this showed me how much he ’d really changed . For him to even think about all the experiences he ’d missed out on because of alcohol was self - reflective in a way that the old Austin never would have come to terms with . “
101081	101093	101094	101094	Me	52	” I whispered . My lips hovered an inch from his . “
101098	101110	101094	101094	Me	52	” His eyes darted to my lips and then back up . “
101115	101116	101094	101094	Me	52	” “
101121	101130	101131	101131	I	52	” I whispered , aching for a kiss . “
101135	101147	101148	101148	You	1519	” My heart stopped , and butterflies erupted in my stomach . “
101151	101155	101148	101148	You	1519	” He nodded . “
101166	101167	101148	101148	You	1519	” “
101174	101175	101148	101148	You	1519	” “
101180	101190	101191	101191	I	52	” he asked , brushing his nose against mine . “
101197	101326	101191	101191	I	52	” No other words had to be spoken . We ’d both been holding that in for so long , neither willing to really dig into our feelings , that it was as if a dam had broken . Austin and I cleared the distance between us at the same time . Our kiss was full of the love we ’d been denying . His lips were soft and inviting . His tongue promised all the dirty things my mind drifted to with him this close . His hands roamed over my tight bodysuit . He leaned me backward on the couch , covering my body with his . I wrapped one leg around his waist . Our hips pressed tightly together , and heat rushed through me . “
101329	101451	101191	101191	I	52	” I groaned as he started to circle his hips in place against me . All coherent thoughts fled my mind . There was just the feel of him against me and the desire to be in a hell of a lot less clothes . One hand slid down the side of my suit and then reached around to grab my ass . He broke off the kiss to trail his mouth down my neck and across my collarbone . I could feel him , thick and ready for me , through his jeans . I could n’t help myself as I pressed my pelvis up . He pushed back , sliding his dick against the thin material covering my body . “
101461	101499	101456	101456	I	52	” he asked . He slipped his hands up and down my sides , hoping to find an easy way to get me out of this suit . I laughed and tossed my head back in exasperation . “
101509	101510	101456	101456	I	52	” “
101528	101584	101585	101585	Julia	48	” Austin gripped my arm when I offered it to him , and he pulled me up off the couch . I dragged him into my bedroom and showed him the tiny zipper in the back . He tugged it down . He whistled softly through his teeth when the zipper rounded over my ass . “
101587	101686	101585	101585	Julia	48	” he groaned . His lips touched the base of my neck and then slowly worked down my back , vertebra by vertebra . Then , he kissed my tailbone and lower . His hands splayed over my ass cheeks as he thoroughly kissed each of them . I tugged my arms out of the sleeves of the suit in my haste to be naked . He helped me drag it the rest of the way down my body until it was in a crumpled pile on my floor . He turned me back around to face him . “
101701	101705	101706	101706	You	1520	” He shuddered . “
101711	101760	101706	101706	You	1520	” His thumbs brushed against my nipples until they hardened into points . Then , he took one in his mouth , sucking on it , until I writhed beneath his touch , and when I was purring in his grip , he moved to the other one . “
101775	101815	101816	101816	I	52	” I muttered , trembling from his touch . My eyes dropped on that Captain America shirt . It showed off those biceps and that chest . But , fuck , I could n’t wait until it was off . “
101830	101834	101818	101818	I	52	” He laughed . “
101841	101842	101818	101818	I	52	” “
101847	101848	101818	101818	I	52	” “
101860	101933	101850	101850	I	52	” He stripped the shirt off over his head . And then … yes . I trailed my nails down his pecs , down those abs , and to that V. Then , I hastily removed his remaining clothes and saw all my other favorite parts of him that I loved to run my hands down . Austin threw his head back and moaned when I palmed his cock in my hand . “
101943	101947	101936	101936	I	52	” he said . “
101959	102089	101955	101955	I	52	” I licked around the head of his cock before popping it into my mouth . His hand went through my hair , tightening ever so slightly . I released him from my mouth with a smirk and then crawled back on the bed . He followed after me , his cock jutting out toward me . Austin settled down between my legs , hiking them up around his hips . He leaned forward onto his elbows to stare down at me . I gripped his biceps as he eased inside me , stretching and filling me to the hilt . His gaze was intent on me as he pushed my hair out of my face . He did n’t move at first , and I squirmed under him . “
102092	102096	101955	101955	I	52	” I whispered . “
102103	102104	101955	101955	I	52	” “
102107	102108	101955	101955	I	52	” “
102114	102118	101955	101955	I	52	” he said , “
102140	102141	102142	102142	Me	52	” “
102151	102155	102156	102156	I	52	” I confessed . “
102162	102427	102156	102156	I	52	” He leaned forward to kiss me and then started moving , keeping to his word . I could n’t even describe how good it felt . His body pressed against mine . His cock sliding in and out of my pussy . Our breath mingling in the space . There was no rush . We had all the time in the world . And , still , he barely had to move as our bodies eased together and then apart and then back together . We were n’t just fucking , like we always had before . For the first time , we were really making love . While I liked both options , when we finally came apart at the same time , my orgasm hit me relentlessly . I saw stars . My mind went blank . I probably could have spoken in tongues . Nothing compared . And I realized that nothing ever would with Austin . Being away from one another for those three months was the best decision of our lives . I ’d found my art again . Austin had stopped drinking . We ’d both healed . It had been necessary . Without it , we never would have gotten to where we were right now . We never would have been able to move on . It had taken that time to show that we were strong enough separate … but better as one . We might be works in progress separately . But , together , we were complete . Epilogue Austin Five Months Later “
102441	102455	102429	102429	I	52	” I asked Julia as we drove to the First Friday Art Trail . “
102458	102597	102429	102429	I	52	” she said coyly . She ’d been hinting at a big event that she had been working toward for months . But nothing I ’d said or done — and , trust me , I ’d tried — could get her to change her mind . She was set on me finding out with everyone else . Because of that , I had n’t been allowed to step foot into her art studio at her apartment . I ’d respected her privacy , but it had been killing me not to know . Julia had a parking spot for the event this time , so she would n’t have to park in a tow zone . I hopped out of her Tahoe and followed her around the corner to one of the warehouses already crowded with people . “
102602	102615	102616	102616	I	52	” she asked . I took her hand and kissed the palm . “
102626	102630	102633	102633	boy	1523	” She laughed . “
102641	102683	102633	102633	boy	1523	” Julia walked me to the back of the exhibit , and when I realized what I was looking at , I stopped dead in my tracks . Julia shot me a worried look . And then I burst into laughter . “
102686	102690	102691	102691	You	1523	” she gasped . “
102700	102707	102691	102691	You	1523	” I said through my laughter . “
102718	102719	102722	102722	Jules	52	” “
102724	102768	102722	102722	Jules	52	” I said , sliding back into that nickname . It had taken a long time before she decided that I could start calling her that again . I was glad . I did n’t want her to associate anything with that douche . “
102774	102800	102769	102769	You	52	” I wiped a tear from my eye , and then I scooped her up in my arms and twirled her around in a circle . “
102809	102818	102769	102769	You	52	” She giggled when I set her down . “
102834	102835	102826	102826	Everyone	253	” “
102844	102845	102836	102836	Everyone	253	” “
102906	102929	102895	102895	I	52	” She bit her lip and then glanced around at the fifteen canvases that showed the range and depth of her abilities . “
102946	102987	102988	102988	I	52	” I could see it when I knew what I was looking at . A watercolor of Waffle . A collection of letters . A charcoal of water . And so many more that I recognized . It was perfect . “
102994	102995	102988	102988	I	52	” “
103000	103019	102988	102988	I	52	” Then , she handed me a piece of paper . I glanced down at it and beamed . “
103032	103038	102988	102988	I	52	” I asked in awe . “
103092	103093	103094	103094	You	1527	” “
103098	103103	103094	103094	You	1527	” I told her . “
103108	103112	103113	103113	I	52	” She beamed . “
103128	103129	103119	103119	I	52	” “
103144	103172	103119	103119	I	52	” I leaned down and drew her into a kiss . A throat cleared behind us , and I whirled around to find Patrick standing behind us . “
103179	103198	103119	103119	I	52	” he asked , pointing at the naked picture of me . I laughed at his astounded face . “
103218	103219	103208	103208	I	52	” “
103226	103233	103234	103234	My	52	” I asked in mock seriousness . “
103239	103313	103234	103234	My	52	” A minute later , the rest of my family showed up with David in tow once more . He had Jason on his shoulders , and Sutton actually seemed not to be miserable at the gesture . That was something at least . Jensen ’s and Landon ’s eyes rounded in the same way that Patrick ’s had when they saw the naked picture of me that Julia had painted last summer . “
103325	103329	103319	103319	you	48	” Landon asked . “
103358	103364	103365	103365	You	48	” Jensen raised his eyebrows . “
103395	103418	103388	103388	I	52	” Julia snort - laughed , and I could n’t keep my laughter in . I clapped my brothers on their backs . “
103423	103427	103388	103388	I	52	” I insisted . “
103433	103455	103456	103456	I	52	” Landon said as he wandered over to look at the picture of Waffle . Heidi came forward and hugged Julia . “
103463	103464	103456	103456	I	52	” “
103471	103475	103456	103456	I	52	” Emery agreed . “
103481	103488	103456	103456	I	52	” Heidi added with a wink . “
103492	103504	103456	103456	I	52	” Emery tilted her head as she stared at the picture . “
103517	103518	103519	103519	Emery	269	” “
103521	103529	103519	103519	Emery	269	” Julia said , covering her face . “
103537	103553	103554	103554	Jesus	67	” Heidi added . It was my turn for my face to turn beet red . “
103564	103565	103566	103566	Duh	199	” “
103568	103706	103707	103707	Lemonade	200	” Heidi said , swishing her blonde hair off her shoulder . Emery just shrugged . Her eyes glanced down to my shorts once , and then she laughed . It was Julia who finally herded them away . I could hear them chatting and giggling . As thick as thieves , that trio was . We spent the rest of the First Friday camped out near Julia ’s exhibit . She sold three pictures while we were there , but I thought she was more excited about the experience of the whole thing . To use her art for good , no matter what money it brought in . When I could see she was flagging , I finally drew her away from the warehouse and out to the food trucks to grab something for dinner . “
103709	103713	103707	103707	Lemonade	200	” I guessed . “
103722	103726	103707	103707	Lemonade	200	” she teased . “
103733	103857	103730	103730	I	52	” I got her the lemonade and both of us barbeque . My eyes drifted to the red Solo cups everyone was carrying and the signs for alcohol . Several months ago , I would n’t have even been able to come to First Friday . It was a testament to the fact that I was now eight months sober and that I was able to be here for Julia . It was n’t easy . There were times when I thought I ’d never make it , but it was the right choice . And , as we moved to an empty picnic table amid the chaos and I sat across from Julia , I knew that it was worth the effort . “
103868	103876	103858	103858	I	52	” I told Julia . She flushed . “
103888	103889	103884	103884	I	52	” “
103897	103906	103891	103891	you	1534	” Julia ’s eyes flashed up to mine . “
103909	103910	103891	103891	you	1534	” “
103919	103920	103891	103891	you	1534	” “
103928	103935	103936	103936	I	52	” she said with a laugh . “
104022	104023	104024	104024	Austin	48	” “
104032	104036	104024	104024	Austin	48	” I grinned . “
104061	104069	104048	104048	you	1534	” She laughed and shook her head . “
104077	104078	104048	104048	you	1534	” “
104084	104085	104086	104086	I	52	” “
104105	104106	104096	104096	I	52	” “
