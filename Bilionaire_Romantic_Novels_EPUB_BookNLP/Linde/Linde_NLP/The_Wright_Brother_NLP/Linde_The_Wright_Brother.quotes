382	389	390	390	I	678	“ God , this is embarrassing , ”
393	421	390	390	I	678	“ I ’m leaving . I ’m leaving you , I ’m leaving the program , and I ’m leaving the university . I ’m fucking done . ”
422	432	433	433	he	210	“ You ca n’t leave the program , Emery , ”

545	579	580	580	He	210	“ That ’s rich , coming from you . I ’m well aware of what I saw . I doubt it was the first time , too . How many others are there ? ”
594	603	590	590	I	678	“ We can make this work , Emery . ”
604	615	622	622	he	210	“ God , do you think I ’m an idiot ? ”
616	621	622	622	he	210	“ Oh , Em , ”
631	638	639	639	I	678	“ Do n’t act so childish . ”
646	691	639	639	I	678	“ I am not acting childish by accusing the man I loved of sleeping with someone else . I ’m standing up for what I think is right , and your bullshit routine is far from that . Are you sleeping with other students ? ”
692	698	639	639	I	678	“ Honey , come on . ”
699	707	708	708	I	678	“ You are , are n’t you ? ”
715	747	708	708	I	678	“ Wow , I am an idiot . Not only do I really not want to be in academia , but I also really do n’t want to be with you . ”
748	751	752	752	he	678	“ Emery , ”
761	774	775	775	I	678	“ It ’s been three years . You ca n’t do this . ”
779	798	799	799	He	678	“ Tell me you ’re not fucking anyone else and that I ’m the only girl for you . ”

1349	1368	1343	1343	I	678	“ Lubbock . It ’s west Texas . Stuff actually exists there . Texas Tech and Buddy Holly . ”
1459	1465	1466	1466	I	678	“ Hey , Lily Bug , ”

1536	1542	1512	1512	Kimber	227	“ You could say that . ”
1576	1598	1599	1599	Lilyanne	557	“ Em ! Do you want to see my new dress ? It has dinosaurs on it . Dinosaurs say rawr ! ”
1602	1626	1627	1627	Kimber	227	“ Not now , Lily . We have to get Emery into the guest room . Can you show her where to go ? ”
1646	1658	1637	1637	she	557	“ Come on , Auntie Em . I know the way . ”
1664	1672	1659	1659	Kimber	227	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
1673	1704	1705	1705	I	678	“ Me , too . She ’s a handful . But it ’s good to have her . How else would I be able to find my way around here ? ”
1718	1738	1739	1739	I	678	“ Seriously , are we in Beauty and the Beast ? Is there a west wing I should avoid ? ”
1749	1756	1742	1742	Kimber	227	“ It ’s not that big . ”
1757	1770	1742	1742	Kimber	227	“ Never too big for a library with ladders , of course . ”
1771	1782	1742	1742	Kimber	227	“ Of course . We might have one of those . ”
1783	1807	1808	1808	Kimber	227	“ I knew it ! Please tell me all the dirty romance novels we read in high school are proudly on display now . ”

1867	1870	1871	1871	I	678	“ Fancy , ”
1880	1901	1902	1902	Kimber	227	“ I could use an iPad . Just throwing that out there in case Noah needs gift ideas for Christmas . ”
1905	1913	1902	1902	Kimber	227	“ God , I ’ve missed you . ”
1960	1966	1967	1967	Kimber	227	“ Come on , Lilyanne , ”
1970	1978	1967	1967	Kimber	227	“ We have cookies in the oven . ”
1979	1982	1983	1983	I	678	“ Cookies ? ”

2088	2101	2102	2102	Kimber	227	“ Did you even let her know you were coming into town ? ”
2153	2158	2146	2146	I	678	“ No , but … ”
2159	2195	2148	2148	Kimber	227	“ Gah , Emery ! She ’s going to kill me if you stay here without telling her you ’re in town . I do not want to deal with that while I ’m pregnant . ”
2196	2204	2205	2205	I	678	“ I ’m going to tell her ! ”
2221	2233	2213	2213	Kimber	227	“ Those are too hot . Wait for them to cool . ”
2234	2244	2245	2245	Lilyanne	557	“ You do n’t want a boo - boo , ”
2263	2266	2248	2248	I	678	“ Fine . ”
2385	2389	2376	2376	I	678	“ Missed you . ”
2390	2405	2406	2406	My	678	“ You , too , Em . I heard you were having some trouble . ”
2410	2424	2406	2406	My	678	“ Yeah . Thanks for letting me stay while I figure things out . ”
2425	2466	2467	2468	My sister	227	“ You ’re always welcome here . It ’ll be good to have you around for Kimber , too . She ’s home a lot with this one , and I know she ’s ready to get back to work . ”

2742	2761	2736	2736	I	678	“ Guys , I ’m going to have to finish this game early . My bestie is here . ”
2897	2902	2903	2904	the guy	261	“ You hustled us ! ”
2917	2921	2907	2907	She	208	“ Pay up ! ”
2957	2962	2963	2963	Heidi	208	“ Emery , baby , ”
2973	2980	2963	2963	Heidi	208	“ I have missed your face . ”

3029	3035	3022	3022	Peter	76	“ Hey , prom queen . ”
3036	3044	3051	3051	he	76	“ That was Kimber . Not me ! ”
3045	3050	3051	3051	he	76	“ Oh , right , ”
3068	3078	3079	3079	I	678	“ You dated that Wright brother though , right ? ”
3121	3124	3125	3125	I	678	“ Yeah , ”
3128	3134	3125	3125	I	678	“ a long time ago . ”
3135	3142	3143	3143	Heidi	208	“ Speaking of the Wright brothers , ”
3167	3170	3125	3125	I	678	“ Nope . ”
3171	3187	3125	3125	I	678	“ Now that you ’re newly single after you kicked that jerk to the curb . ”
3188	3201	3125	3125	I	678	“ Oh God , Heidi , can we not talk about Mitch ? ”
3202	3218	3219	3219	I	678	“ I promise I wo n’t talk about the skeezeball if you hear me out . ”
3223	3232	3219	3219	I	678	“ All right . What about the Wrights ? ”
3233	3242	3125	3125	I	678	“ Sutton Wright is getting married on Saturday . ”
3243	3247	3248	3248	I	678	“ She is ? ”
3253	3261	3262	3262	Heidi	208	“ Is n’t she still at Tech ? ”
3265	3286	3262	3262	Heidi	208	“ She found the one . It ’s kind of a rush job . They only got engaged on Halloween . ”
3287	3290	3291	3291	I	678	“ Shotgun ? ”
3337	3369	3326	3329	the five Wright siblings	275	“ No idea really , but I ’d guess so . Either way , who cares ? I am not missing a chance for an open bar and a swank party . ”
3370	3376	3377	3377	I	678	“ Have fun with that , ”
3381	3391	3392	3392	Heidi	208	“ I ’m taking you with me , bitch , ”
3430	3443	3426	3426	I	678	“ You know I have a rule about Wright siblings , right ? ”
3444	3461	3426	3426	I	678	“ I know you ’ve been jaded against the lot of them after Landon , yes . ”
3462	3474	3426	3426	I	678	“ Oh no , you know it ’s not just Landon . ”
3475	3504	3505	3505	Heidi	208	“ Yeah , so they ’re all a bag of dicks . Who cares ? Let ’s go get drunk on their dime and make fun of them . ”
3521	3527	3528	3528	I	678	“ I ’ll put out . ”
3535	3542	3528	3528	I	678	“ You ’re such a whore . ”
3543	3561	3562	3562	I	678	“ You love me . I ’ll get you a new dress . We ’ll have fun . ”
3570	3576	3577	3578	Two Jensen	2210	“ Fine . Why not ? ”
3579	3597	3598	3598	I	678	“ My whore sister is pregnant again , and this time , she wants to keep it , ”
3617	3633	3636	3636	Austin	1648	“ Yeah , that ’s kind of the point of the wedding today , Jensen , ”
3711	3722	3704	3704	he	278	“ Ca n’t believe we ’re fucking doing this today . ”
3723	3731	3732	3732	Austin	1648	“ She ’s in love , man , ”
3754	3789	3743	3743	I	678	“ He ’s looking for a paycheck . A paycheck that I ’m going to have to provide because there ’s no way he ’ll be able to take care of our little sister . ”
3803	3818	3822	3822	him	278	“ Have a drink . You ’re being too uptight about the whole thing . ”
3906	3921	3893	3893	I	678	“ Have another drink , Austin . You remind me so much of Dad . ”
3922	3937	3944	3944	Morgan	86	“ Fuck you , Jensen . Ca n’t you just be happy for Sutton ? ”
3938	3943	3944	3944	Morgan	86	“ Yeah , Jensen , ”
4014	4025	4026	4026	I	678	“ Do n’t you start in on this , too , ”
4030	4056	4057	4057	Morgan	86	“ Sutton is her own person . She always has been . She does whatever she wants to do , no matter what anyone says , ”
4075	4109	4069	4069	she	86	“ Do n’t you remember that time she decided she was a princess superhero ? Mom could n’t get her out of a tutu , cape , and crown for almost a year . ”
4138	4167	4168	4168	I	678	“ Yeah , I remember . I ’d be happier about the whole thing with what ’s his face if he was n’t such a completely incompetent dipshit , ”
4172	4178	4179	4179	Austin	1648	“ His name is Maverick , ”
4183	4198	4199	4199	he	1648	“ And you ca n’t fucking talk , man . Your name is Jensen , ”
4210	4220	4199	4199	he	1648	“ It ’s a fucking weird name , too . ”
4221	4249	4250	4250	Morgan	86	“ It ’s not a weird name . Maverick is a douche name , especially since he goes by Maverick and not Mav or Rick or something . ”
4263	4277	4250	4250	Morgan	86	“ Let ’s drop it , shall we ? Where is Landon anyway ? ”
4336	4341	4342	4342	Austin	1648	“ Hey , Landon , ”
4360	4363	4364	4364	Landon	278	“ Hey , ”
4609	4619	4620	4620	Miranda	215	“ Well , what a happy reunion this is , ”
4658	4661	4662	4662	Austin	1648	“ Miranda , ”
4674	4680	4665	4665	He	1648	“ Good to see you . ”
4681	4686	4687	4687	she	303	“ Thanks , Austin , ”
4816	4822	4823	4823	Miranda	215	“ Come on , Morgan , ”
4826	4839	4823	4823	Miranda	215	“ I ’m sure Sutton will need us with the other bridesmaids . ”
4840	4862	4863	4863	Morgan	86	“ I ’m sure . Why do n’t you head over there and tell her I ’ll be just a minute ? ”
4904	4917	4898	4898	she	215	“ I ’ll see you at the ceremony , honey . Kiss ? ”
4937	4942	4927	4927	she	215	“ I love you . ”
4943	4950	4951	4951	he	278	“ I love you , too , ”
4968	4973	4974	4974	Morgan	86	“ Bless her heart , ”
4977	4980	4981	4981	Landon	278	“ Y’all , ”
4984	4988	4981	4981	Landon	278	“ do n’t . ”
5003	5016	5017	5017	Landon	278	“ Are you ever going to give it a break , Morgan ? ”
5020	5026	5017	5017	Landon	278	“ No , probably not . ”
5027	5037	4981	4981	Landon	278	“ We ’ve been married for two years now . ”
5038	5050	5051	5051	I	678	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re staying at a hotel , ”
5069	5076	5054	5054	Landon	278	“ Miranda wanted to stay downtown . ”
5077	5091	5092	5092	Austin	1648	“ And , before we start World War III by bringing up Miranda , ”
5096	5135	5092	5092	Austin	1648	“ I feel like someone should grab Sutton . We ’re about to suffer through a couple of hours of pictures with eighteen of her closest friends . Might have some time , just the five of us . ”
5136	5144	5145	5145	I	678	“ I limited her to nine bridesmaids , ”
5148	5154	5155	5155	Morgan	86	“ That ’s a limit ? ”
5161	5172	5155	5155	Morgan	86	“ I do n’t think I even like nine people . ”
5173	5182	5183	5183	I	678	“ You were n’t in a sorority either , ”
5187	5211	5212	5212	Austin	1648	“ I do n’t like people . I certainly would n’t like to pay for new sisters . Sutton is above and beyond . ”
5300	5311	5293	5293	we	315	“ You want to go see if she ’s decent ? ”
5319	5332	5316	5316	She	86	“ This is what I get for being the only other girl . ”
5480	5486	5487	5487	Sutton	80	“ Hey , y’ all ! ”
5501	5511	5487	5487	Sutton	80	“ Morgan said you needed me for something important . ”
5525	5545	5546	5546	She	86	“ Your brothers tried to drink the bottle before you got here , but I thought , a toast ? ”
5551	5560	5546	5546	She	86	“ You know I ca n’t have that . ”
5584	5589	5579	5579	she	86	“ How about this ? ”
5590	5598	5599	5599	she	86	“ Yes ! Make mine a double , ”
5647	5650	5651	5651	Sutton	80	“ Annnd , ”
5655	5675	5651	5651	Sutton	80	“ while I have you here , Jensen , I wanted to run one teensy little thing by you . ”
5789	5793	5794	5794	I	678	“ Oh no , ”
5797	5802	5794	5794	I	678	“ What is it ? ”
5803	5826	5777	5777	she	86	“ Look , I was talking to Maverick last night , and I know that he already signed the prenup , but — ”
5832	5835	5777	5777	she	86	“ No . ”
5836	5844	5777	5777	she	86	“ I did n’t even ask anything ! ”
5845	5861	5777	5777	she	86	“ I know what you ’re going to ask , and the answer is no . ”
5862	5928	5929	5929	Morgan	86	“ But it ’s silly , Jensen . Really ! He ’s the love of my life . We ’re going to spend eternity together . A prenup is ridiculous . It ’s a bad way to enter a marriage . If you ’re thinking about how it ’s going to end before it even starts , then what does that say about a person ? ”
5975	6033	5967	5967	I	678	“ You are worth a small fortune , Sutton . And I do n’t give a fuck who you ’re marrying . You get a prenup to protect yourself in case something happens . Thinking about the future is a way to ensure that you are not getting scammed . No matter how much somebody loves you . ”
6034	6039	6040	6040	Sutton	80	“ But , Jensen — ”
6049	6052	6053	6053	Austin	1648	“ Sutton , ”
6059	6089	6053	6053	Austin	1648	“ do you really want to do this right now ? I mean , Jensen and Landon both had a prenup . No one marries a Wright without it . ”
6090	6095	6096	6096	I	678	“ That ’s right , ”
6106	6116	6117	6117	Morgan	86	“ Plus , you ’re only twenty - one , ”
6120	6127	6117	6117	Morgan	86	“ Who knows what could happen ? ”
6128	6137	6138	6138	Sutton	80	“ Oh , wow . Thanks , Morgan , ”
6141	6155	6156	6156	she	80	“ I did n’t mean that Maverick is n’t ‘ the one , ’ ”
6162	6183	6156	6156	she	80	“ I just mean , Jensen did n’t think he ’d divorce Vanessa under any circumstances and look what happened . ”
6227	6249	6250	6250	I	678	“ If Maverick really wants to throw out the prenup , I ’d be happy to talk to him about it , ”
6263	6278	6258	6258	She	80	“ I ’m not that stupid . You ’d scare him half to death . ”
6279	6299	6258	6258	She	80	“ Well , if he ’s trying to take you for your money , then he ’d deserve it . ”
6300	6326	6258	6258	She	80	“ Okay , fine . I get it . I just thought I ’d ask . Maverick and I had a long talk about it . ”
6327	6331	6332	6332	Landon	278	“ I bet , ”
6338	6343	6344	6344	Sutton	80	“ Anyway , shots ! ”
6376	6396	6370	6370	I	678	“ To Sutton , on the happiest day of her life and to many more amazing years to come . ”
6449	6460	6461	6461	I	678	“ Heidi , what are you doing to my hair ? ”
6470	6492	6493	6493	She	208	“ I ’m making you look presentable , Em . You just wait . It will come together at the end . ”
6743	6754	6755	6755	Heidi	208	“ I swear , it ’s going to be cute , ”
6759	6767	6768	6768	I	678	“ I know . I trust you , ”
6771	6810	6768	6768	I	678	“ I can not believe that you talked me into going to this wedding with you . Is it going to be like a high school reunion ? I do n’t know if I ’m prepared for that . ”
6811	6820	6821	6821	Heidi	208	“ It ’s not a high school reunion , ”
6824	6863	6821	6821	Heidi	208	“ I got invited because I work for the Wrights and , like , half of the company was invited . It ’s going to be a big wedding . I doubt you ’ll even run into him . ”
6864	6885	6886	6886	I	678	“ I am not worried about running into Landon . It ’s been almost ten years since we broke up , ”
6890	6898	6899	6899	Heidi	208	“ Did n’t he get married anyway ? ”
6912	6927	6902	6902	She	208	“ I do n’t follow him . You would know more than I would . ”
6936	6986	6928	6928	I	678	“ Stop giving me that look . Do you know how many guys I ’ve dated since Landon ? No , you do n’t . Because I ca n’t even remember , but it ’s a lot . And I ’m currently sitting right here because of guy trouble . ”
6987	6995	6996	6996	Heidi	208	“ I just know you and Landon , ”
7000	7030	7031	7031	I	678	“ Perfect high school couple . That was , like , the only thing that you beat Kimber in . You and Landon got Best Couple in the yearbook . ”
7036	7049	7031	7031	I	678	“ Please stop reminiscing about high school , or I ’ll vomit . ”
7050	7055	7056	7056	Heidi	208	“ You were cute , ”
7059	7114	7115	7115	Heidi	208	“ If you think for a minute that something is going to happen with him at this wedding , you ’re out of your mind . Not only is he married , but he ’ll also be there with his wife . And , as of today , I ’m officially swearing off men . ”
7118	7125	7126	7126	she	208	“ Yeah , right , Em , ”
7129	7148	7126	7126	she	208	“ You are boy crazy and always have been . Even when you were our little skater girl . ”
7149	7188	7189	7189	I	678	“ Look , Mitch fooled me into thinking that he loved me . He was , like , fifteen years older than me and a total player . I ’m almost certain he was sleeping with an undergrad , ”
7193	7224	7189	7189	I	678	“ I mean … how bad is my judgment skewed that I ended up with someone like that ? I think I just need to be single for a while . ”
7225	7229	7230	7230	Heidi	208	“ All right , ”
7263	7269	7258	7258	she	208	“ More for me tonight . ”
7270	7275	7276	7276	Heidi	208	“ All for you . ”
7299	7307	7284	7284	She	208	“ There . What do you think ? ”
7397	7403	7404	7404	I	678	“ You have a gift , ”
7408	7417	7404	7404	I	678	“ You ’ve made me look human again . ”
7418	7425	7426	7426	Heidi	208	“ Go put on your dress , ”
7429	7440	7426	7426	Heidi	208	“ I ca n’t wait to see it all together ! ”
7441	7452	7453	7453	I	678	“ All right . All right . I ’m going . ”
7480	7485	7477	7477	Heidi	208	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
7580	7590	7591	7591	Heidi	208	“ You are so getting laid in that dress , ”
7600	7612	7594	7594	I	678	“ No boys . This is a no - fly zone . ”
7613	7632	7633	7633	Heidi	208	“ You wo n’t be saying that tonight when you ’re getting fucked . All I ’m saying , ”
7636	7651	7633	7633	Heidi	208	“ Hopefully , it ’s Landon Wright . That would be so full circle . ”
7652	7672	7673	7673	I	678	“ Do n’t even say that . If I see him , I will run in the opposite direction , ”
7689	7696	7697	7697	Heidi	208	“ All right , all right , ”
7705	7730	7697	7697	Heidi	208	“ No boys . I got it . If Landon approaches you , I ’ll distract him . I still have some cheer moves . ”
7767	7808	7762	7762	she	208	“ Oh my God , if you do that in your dress , you are going to be more than a distraction for Landon . You are going to rip your dress in half for the entire party to see . ”
7814	7828	7809	7809	Heidi	208	“ I ’m going to get dressed , and then we can go . ”
7858	7881	7850	7850	She	208	“ Come on , sexy . You ’re my date tonight . Let ’s get Kimber to take a picture of us ! ”
7969	7987	7988	7988	Heidi	208	“ This is so going on Instagram . Damn , it ’s good to have you back , ”
7991	7996	7997	7997	I	678	“ Use a filter , ”
8000	8007	8008	8008	Kimber	227	“ You just filtered your face , ”
8020	8028	8008	8008	Kimber	227	“ You do n’t need a filter . ”
8029	8036	8037	8037	Heidi	208	“ My life needs a filter , ”
8097	8109	8110	8110	I	678	“ You really do n’t mind dropping us off , Kimber ? ”
8113	8132	8110	8110	I	678	“ Not a problem . I want to hear all about the antics when y’ all are done . ”
8133	8140	8141	8141	Heidi	208	“ I ’ll live tweet you , ”
8144	8161	8162	8162	Kimber	227	“ Oh my God , you are not going to be on your phone all night , ”
8165	8180	8162	8162	Kimber	227	“ You should enjoy yourself . Get drunk and make a mistake or two . ”
8181	8186	8187	8187	Heidi	208	“ Done and done , ”
8193	8201	8187	8187	Heidi	208	“ Let ’s get out of here . ”
8247	8255	8256	8256	I	678	“ How many people did Sutton invite ? ”
8266	8276	8277	8277	Heidi	208	“ It looks like everyone she ’s ever met , ”
8280	8287	8288	8288	I	678	“ Or the whole freaking city , ”
8291	8299	8300	8300	Heidi	208	“ Maybe we should hop out here , ”
8303	8307	8308	8308	Kimber	227	“ Be safe , ”
8311	8319	8320	8320	Heidi	208	“ Take some condoms for the kids . ”
8335	8340	8325	8325	I	678	“ Thanks , Kimber . ”
8341	8346	8347	8347	Heidi	208	“ Bye , babe ! ”
8449	8453	8454	8454	Heidi	208	“ Stop hobbling , ”
8470	8491	8463	8463	they	361	“ I ’m not hobbling . I just do n’t think I ’ll be able to wear these all night . ”
8492	8519	8520	8520	I	678	“ We ’ll take them off once we get to the reception . But , right now , you need them to be able to see . ”
8525	8544	8520	8520	I	678	“ I ’m not that short . I can see fine . You ’re just super freaking tall . ”
8545	8557	8463	8463	they	361	“ Well , we ca n’t both be perfect , Em . ”
8558	8571	8572	8572	I	678	“ Oh my God , why are you my best friend again ? ”
8575	8579	8580	8580	she	208	“ Beats me , ”
8680	8685	8686	8687	the boy	371	“ Bride or groom ? ”
8723	8726	8727	8727	Heidi	208	“ Bride , ”
8730	8738	8727	8727	Heidi	208	“ We ’re friends of the bride . ”
8739	8748	8749	8749	he	371	“ Cool . How do you know Sutton ? ”
8764	8770	8771	8771	Heidi	208	“ We grew up together , ”
8783	8790	8780	8780	she	208	“ Family friend . Got it . ”
8849	8855	8856	8856	he	371	“ Family friends up front , ”
8883	8892	8870	8870	Heidi	208	“ You ’re leaving me on the end ? ”
8898	8906	8893	8893	I	678	“ Yeah . Sit your ass down . ”
8907	8918	8919	8919	I	678	“ This was not part of the deal , Martin , ”
8928	8941	8919	8919	I	678	“ Ohhh , using my last name . I ’m real scared . ”
8942	8950	8893	8893	I	678	“ You owe me big for this . ”
8951	8979	8919	8919	I	678	“ Just enjoy it , Em . It ’ll be over in , like , fifteen minutes , and then we can drink for free all night . ”
8980	8985	8986	8986	I	678	“ Right . Priorities , ”
9203	9207	9191	9192	the bridesmaids	384	“ Canon in D ”
9314	9323	9303	9303	Heidi	208	“ Ten bucks , she ’s a crier . ”
9324	9335	9336	9336	I	678	“ She ’s pregnant . She ’s definitely a crier , ”
9381	9388	9389	9389	he	378	“ You may all be seated , ”
9407	9426	9392	9392	I	678	“ We are gathered here today to join Sutton Marie Wright to Maverick Wayne Johnson in holy matrimony . ”
9548	9552	9553	9553	Yada	96	“ I do . ”
9559	9566	9567	9567	Yada	96	“ Till death do us part . ”

10285	10296	10297	10297	Heidi	208	“ You so did . You so , so did ! ”
10333	10384	10330	10330	she	208	“ Do you remember mooning over him in high school ? He was , like , this hottie college guy , a totally unattainable god . Like Zeus on Mount Olympus . Or maybe we just wanted to get on his lightning bolt , if you know what I mean . ”
10385	10395	10330	10330	she	208	“ Heidi , God , you ’re so embarrassing . ”
10396	10416	10330	10330	she	208	“ Em , just think about Jensen when we were in high school . He belonged in a magazine . ”
10417	10424	10330	10330	she	208	“ I was dating his brother . ”
10425	10430	10431	10431	she	418	“ But before that , ”
10434	10449	10330	10330	she	208	“ Okay . I might remember staying at your house a time or two … ”
10450	10454	10330	10330	she	208	“ Or ten . ”
10455	10464	10330	10330	she	208	“ Where we talked about him being hot . ”
10465	10489	10490	10490	Heidi	208	“ Yes . And he has gone from hot to one damn fine wine . The bottle gets better with age , honey , ”
10499	10521	10490	10490	Heidi	208	“ Are you really suggesting I hook up with Jensen Wright at his sister ’s wedding when I dated his brother ? ”
10531	10560	10522	10522	I	678	“ Getting ahead of yourself , are n’t you ? I did n’t say hook up with him . You said that . Are you thinking about that ? ”
10561	10564	10565	10565	I	678	“ No , ”

10841	10851	10832	10832	Heidi	208	“ We ’re table twelve . My lucky number . ”
10852	10870	10877	10877	Heidi	208	“ That ’s because Brandon McCain wore that number on the football team all through high school . ”
10871	10876	10877	10877	Heidi	208	“ Okay , fine , ”
10883	10892	10893	10893	I	678	“ It ’s my get - lucky number . ”
10896	10901	10893	10893	I	678	“ That ’s rich . ”

10971	10991	10949	10949	I	678	“ But at least we have Julia . Julia Banner . She ’s cool . You ’ll like her . ”
10992	11002	10949	10949	I	678	“ I ’ve never heard you mention her before . ”

11033	11084	11018	11018	she	208	“ I like to make sure they ’re going to stick around Lubbock for more than a year . So many burned friendships with people who move here and then relocate immediately . We ’ll see if she survives , and then I ’ll decide if we bring her in . ”
11085	11095	11096	11096	I	678	“ You act like we ’re in a gang , ”
11113	11117	11106	11106	Heidi	208	“ We are . ”

13365	13386	13360	13360	He	278	“ I hope she ’s as big of a challenge as the Tarman merger I ’m working on right now . ”
13396	13415	13387	13387	Patrick	278	“ I doubt it . You ’re a fucking Wright , man . Girls are not a challenge . ”
13422	13427	13387	13387	Patrick	278	“ We ’ll see . ”
13617	13620	13621	13621	I	678	“ Ladies , ”
13642	13652	13628	13628	I	678	“ You looked like you could use a refill . ”
13653	13661	13662	13662	Heidi	208	“ Oh , look at that service , ”
13671	13682	13683	13683	Julia	100	“ Not every day you get champagne from the boss , ”
13692	13695	13696	13698	the other girl	462	“ Thanks , ”
13725	13733	13734	13734	I	678	“ Are y’ all enjoying the party ? ”
13737	13742	13743	13743	Julia	100	“ It ’s nice , ”
13746	13754	13755	13755	Heidi	208	“ Your sister sure likes to dance , ”
13778	13794	13795	13795	I	678	“ Well , I ’m glad you could make it . Who is your friend ? ”
13843	13846	13847	13847	she	462	“ Heidi , ”
13850	13859	13847	13847	she	462	“ what did you do to my face ? ”
13860	13866	13867	13867	Heidi	208	“ This is … Em , ”
13914	13928	13929	13929	I	678	“ Well , it ’s nice to meet you . I ’m Jensen , ”
13939	13944	13945	13945	Em	67	“ Uh - huh , ”
14011	14019	14020	14020	Heidi	208	“ Head of Wright Construction , Em , ”
14036	14043	14029	14029	Em	67	“ I know who he is . ”
14044	14056	14057	14057	I	678	“ I promise , whatever you ’ve heard is a lie , ”
14063	14074	14075	14075	she	462	“ I did n’t say I ’d heard anything bad , ”
14093	14104	14078	14078	She	462	“ Seriously … what is it with you Wright brothers ? ”
14105	14109	14110	14110	I	678	“ Excuse me ? ”
14117	14121	14122	14122	Heidi	208	“ Ignore her , ”
14125	14141	14122	14122	Heidi	208	“ She ’s an old friend , and she just needs another glass of champagne . ”
14160	14168	14169	14169	Em	67	“ Give . Him . A. Chance . ”
14217	14222	14208	14208	she	208	“ I ’m just … ”
14235	14242	14223	14223	She	208	“ Mind if I join you ? ”
14246	14249	14250	14250	she	208	“ Sure , ”
14402	14410	14411	14411	I	678	“ I noticed you at the ceremony , ”
14509	14515	14516	14516	She	208	“ Yes . That was … ”
14548	14552	14535	14535	she	208	“ I noticed . ”
14553	14561	14562	14562	I	678	“ Are you in town , visiting ? ”
14584	14598	14599	14599	I	678	“ Look , whatever this is , it ’s not going to work . ”
14604	14613	14599	14599	I	678	“ And what do you think this is ? ”
14614	14622	14599	14599	I	678	“ Honestly , I do n’t know . ”
14623	14631	14632	14632	I	678	“ I ’m just talking to you , ”
14635	14646	14649	14649	she	208	“ I ’m not fooled by that notion , Jensen . ”
14814	14821	14822	14822	She	208	“ Do you have a boyfriend ? ”
14835	14848	14822	14822	She	208	“ I do n’t need a reason to say no to you . ”
14892	14910	14911	14911	I	678	“ I know you do n’t need a reason . But it feels like you have one , ”
14921	14946	14911	14911	I	678	“ Yes , I have a reason . And , when you figure it out , you ’ll no longer be interested in me . ”
14947	14953	14954	14954	I	678	“ I highly doubt that , ”
14960	14982	14954	14954	I	678	“ I swore off the Wright family a long time ago . So , you ’ll have better luck somewhere else . ”
15451	15454	15455	15455	she	86	“ Fuck ! ”
15458	15462	15455	15455	she	86	“ Gimme that . ”
15492	15497	15498	15498	I	678	“ Trouble with Landon ? ”
15506	15513	15514	15514	She	86	“ With Miranda , of course . ”
15526	15532	15514	15514	She	86	“ What happened this time ? ”
15533	15537	15538	15538	she	86	“ Get this , ”
15558	15571	15547	15547	She	86	“ Miranda was pissed because Landon ’s ex - girlfriend is here ! ”
15572	15594	15544	15544	her	86	“ Why would she care if his ex was here ? He ’s married to her , for Christ ’s sake . ”
15595	15602	15603	15603	Morgan	86	“ Well , that ’s Miranda . ”
15606	15612	15613	15613	I	678	“ Yes , it is , ”
15624	15640	15616	15616	I	678	“ She drives me batshit crazy . I do n’t know why they ’re together . ”
15641	15650	15651	15651	I	678	“ Your guess is as good as mine . ”
16302	16308	16282	16282	she	100	“ You were watching me . ”
16309	16315	16316	16316	I	678	“ Is that a crime ? ”
16319	16329	16316	16316	I	678	“ Suppose not . Why were you watching me ? ”
16330	16350	16282	16282	she	100	“ Because you ’re the most beautiful girl in the room , and I like the way you move . ”
16351	16359	16316	16316	I	678	“ Jensen , this could never happen . ”
16360	16365	16366	16366	I	678	“ You mentioned that , ”
16385	16393	16394	16394	she	100	“ Do you know who I am ? ”
16397	16409	16410	16410	I	678	“ Em . And that ’s all I need to know . ”
16468	16471	16472	16472	she	100	“ Fuck , ”
16491	16494	16495	16495	I	678	“ Yes , ”
16498	16518	16495	16495	I	678	“ You tell me to go away yet ask me to come here . What exactly do you want ? ”
16584	16596	16597	16597	she	100	“ I do n’t know . This is a bad idea , ”
16600	16609	16610	16610	She	100	“ Seems like a good idea to me . ”
16615	16624	16610	16610	She	100	“ I ’ve had a lot to drink . ”
16625	16630	16631	16631	I	678	“ Me , too , ”
16639	16651	16652	16652	I	678	“ And , now , I really want to kiss you . ”
16690	16696	16674	16674	She	100	“ But we ca n’t . ”
16697	16701	16702	16702	She	100	“ Ca n’t ? ”
16717	16720	16702	16702	She	100	“ Nope . ”
16721	16728	16729	16729	I	678	“ You want to kiss me , ”
16744	16754	16729	16729	I	678	“ But you ca n’t . Or wo n’t ? ”
16755	16761	16762	16762	she	100	“ Oh , I will , ”
16765	16771	16774	16774	she	100	“ But I should n’t . ”
17045	17052	17034	17034	She	100	“ Jensen … I … we … ”
17053	17056	17057	17057	I	678	“ Em , ”
17149	17152	17153	17153	I	678	“ Hello ? ”
17156	17162	17165	17165	Margaret	107	“ Hello , Mr. Wright , ”
17168	17202	17165	17165	Margaret	107	“ I hope this is a good time . I got the paperwork in that you need to look over , and you told me to contact you as soon as it arrived . ”
17203	17209	17210	17210	I	678	“ Yes . Thank you , ”
17290	17310	17311	17311	she	107	“ Do you need me to come into the office today to go over this with you , sir ? ”
17314	17341	17342	17342	She	107	“ No , thank you , Margaret . I ’ll look at it in my home office and get back with you about it on Monday . ”
17349	17363	17342	17342	She	107	“ I think they ’re going to want an answer today , sir . ”
17364	17418	17342	17342	She	107	“ They ’ve kept me on the line for five days about this . And I ’ll have to fly there to finish off the negotiations with Tarman . We have another day to wait . Plus , if I can lower their offer , we ’ll all have bigger bonuses this Christmas . ”
17419	17430	17342	17342	She	107	“ Make them wait all you like then , sir . ”
17431	17437	17438	17438	I	678	“ Thank you , Margaret , ”
17802	17806	17797	17797	he	278	“ Bad time ? ”
17832	17844	17858	17858	his	278	“ Of course not . Just got bogged down in work . ”
17845	17851	17852	17852	Landon	278	“ On Sunday , Jensen ? ”
17880	17901	17902	17902	Landon	278	“ Every day . Someone has to run the company . Not everyone gets to play golf on the weekends . ”
17905	17914	17902	17902	Landon	278	“ Every day . Not just the weekends . ”
17915	17922	17923	17923	I	678	“ How ’s your back anyway ? ”
17950	17987	17946	17946	Landon	278	“ It ’s fine . Better anyway . The physical therapist thinks I should n’t be pushing it as much as I have this year , but none of the Wrights know how to slow down . ”
17994	18020	17946	17946	Landon	278	“ As long as you ’re taking care of it , then you ’ll be fine . People can have a professional golf career forever . ”
18021	18029	18030	18030	Landon	278	“ Yeah , I ’m on it . ”
18035	18054	18030	18030	Landon	278	“ Actually , I came over here so early because Miranda and I are going to head out . ”
18055	18058	18059	18059	I	678	“ What ? ”
18064	18074	18075	18075	Landon	278	“ I thought you were staying through the holidays . ”
18078	18094	18075	18075	Landon	278	“ Miranda wants to go back to Florida until Christmas . We ’ll be back . ”
18095	18106	18107	18107	I	678	“ You ’re staying for church today though , right ? ”
18110	18115	18116	18116	he	278	“ I … no , ”
18123	18129	18119	18119	I	678	“ Not even for Mom ? ”
18130	18134	18135	18135	he	278	“ I know , ”
18139	18147	18135	18135	he	278	“ I want to , but Miranda … ”
18192	18205	18186	18186	He	278	“ Speaking of Miranda , I heard she freaked out last night . ”
18218	18236	18206	18206	Landon	278	“ Yeah , bro , my ex - girlfriend Emery Robinson was there . You remember her ? ”
18249	18253	18254	18254	I	678	“ Emery Robinson , ”
18257	18290	18254	18254	I	678	“ Yeah . You know , my high school girlfriend . I did n’t even recognize her , and Miranda was pissed that she had n’t been informed she ’d be there . ”
18291	18298	18299	18299	I	678	“ You did n’t recognize her ? ”
18311	18320	18299	18299	I	678	“ Nope . How fucked up is that ? ”
18335	18338	18321	18321	I	678	“ Fuck . ”
18339	18342	18343	18343	Landon	278	“ What ? ”
18417	18424	18403	18403	I	678	“ Jensen , what ’s up ? ”
18473	18479	18480	18480	I	678	“ Nothing . Hangover headache , ”
18483	18497	18480	18480	I	678	“ Tell me more about Emery . I remember her … only vaguely . ”
18558	18616	18617	18617	He	536	“ We dated in high school for two years , but we broke up on graduation . The last time I saw her was our five - year high school reunion , and we did n’t talk then , and I had no idea she ’d be at Sutton ’s wedding . I guess Heidi invited her . ”
18622	18633	18634	18634	he	536	“ I mean , I did n’t even recognize her ! ”
18637	18646	18617	18617	He	536	“ How could you not have recognized her ? ”
18647	18669	18670	18670	Landon	278	“ When we dated , she was the captain of the soccer team , who liked to skateboard on the weekends , ”
18676	18712	18670	18670	Landon	278	“ Even at prom , she wore her hair up and no makeup . I do n’t know what she ’s been up to in the past decade . We ’re not even Facebook friends . ”
18713	18719	18720	18720	Landon	278	“ And Miranda was pissed ? ”
18723	18755	18720	18720	Landon	278	“ I do n’t know why . I ’m not interested in the girl I dated in high school , who I have n’t seen in years . I married Miranda . ”
18815	18827	18804	18804	I	678	“ Is that the real reason you ’re leaving this morning ? ”
18837	18856	18828	18828	Landon	278	“ I do n’t know , man . Probably . She ’s super jealous of all my exes . ”
18952	18963	18964	18964	I	678	“ Are you sure you ca n’t stay for church ? ”
18999	19002	19003	19003	I	678	“ Miranda ? ”
19008	19014	19015	19015	he	278	“ The one and only , ”
19018	19025	19015	19015	he	278	“ I should probably head out . ”
19026	19041	19042	19042	Miranda	215	“ Landon ! Let ’s go ! We have to get on the road ! ”
19057	19079	19048	19048	Landon	278	“ I should probably go . I certainly do n’t want to stand between the two of you in another confrontation . ”
19080	19090	19091	19091	Landon	278	“ Morgan ’s the instigator ; I assure you . ”
19101	19115	19116	19116	I	678	“ You do n’t fool as many people as you think you do . ”
19139	19155	19134	19134	Landon	278	“ I just want you to be happy . Tell me Miranda makes you happy . ”
19156	19159	19160	19160	she	541	“ Landon ! ”
19183	19190	19191	19191	Landon	278	“ You ’re a good brother , ”
19207	19233	19234	19234	Landon	278	“ Would you hurry up , or would you rather me leave you behind so that you could be with your ex - girlfriend instead ? ”
19237	19263	19234	19234	Landon	278	“ Come on , Miranda . I ’ve told you a hundred times that I did n’t even know she was going to be here . ”
19264	19289	19290	19290	she	543	“ Well , I ’m sure you ’ll know when we ’re back for Christmas so that you can sneak away and see her , ”
19293	19323	19324	19324	Landon	278	“ Seriously , she ’s just back from college for a few days , visiting a friend . She ’ll be gone before we get back . Calm down , ”
19330	19342	19343	19343	she	543	“ Whatever . Do n’t make me late for the flight , ”
19354	19365	19366	19366	Landon	278	“ I ’ll see you in a couple of weeks , ”
19439	19451	19452	19452	I	678	“ I can not believe you ’re making me do this , ”
19549	19563	19564	19564	Kimber	227	“ You were never going to come over here unless I made you , ”
19591	19600	19601	19601	Kimber	227	“ Do n’t act like you know me . ”
19604	19609	19610	19610	she	290	“ Okay . Done , ”
19680	19690	19691	19691	she	290	“ Well , look what the cat dragged in , ”
19694	19707	19708	19708	I	678	“ Funny , Mom . I ’ve never heard that one before , ”
19714	19729	19708	19708	I	678	“ You ’re not too old to have your ass paddled , young lady . ”
19910	19932	19896	19896	We	559	“ If I ’m not too old for a paddling , that means you ’re not too old either , Mom , ”
19941	19949	19952	19952	she	239	“ Oh , I know , honey . ”
19957	19981	19952	19952	she	239	“ You know , I ’ve been talking to Harry Stevenson across the way , and he used to be a police officer . ”
19982	19988	19989	19989	I	678	“ Oh God , Mom ! ”
20005	20028	20029	20029	she	239	“ Now , where is my granddaughter ? You ca n’t make me feel old by popping out babies , Kimber Leigh , ”
20040	20052	20029	20029	she	239	“ and then not bring them around when you come visit . ”
20053	20071	20029	20029	she	239	“ Lilyanne is with Noah . We ’re going to meet up with them at the church . ”
20072	20080	20081	20081	Autumn	110	“ I suppose that will be fine , ”
20089	20099	20081	20081	Autumn	110	“ How am I supposed to spoil her rotten ? ”
20100	20109	20110	20110	Kimber	227	“ You ’re doing just fine at that , ”
20153	20161	20150	20150	I	678	“ I ’ve missed you , Emery , ”
20166	20190	20150	20150	I	678	“ But , girl , what have you been eating in Austin ? Is anyone feeding you ? You ’re skin and bones . ”
20254	20266	20267	20267	I	678	“ I ’m eating fine . And … I left Austin , ”
20271	20279	20267	20267	I	678	“ I dropped out of the program . ”
20280	20296	20297	20297	Autumn	110	“ Oh . I was really looking forward to having another doctor in the family , ”
20304	20317	20297	20297	Autumn	110	“ Ah , if only I had been guaranteed Noah ’s salary . ”
20318	20325	20326	20326	Kimber	227	“ If only we all were , ”
20329	20342	20326	20326	Kimber	227	“ Are you sad about it ? You do n’t seem sad , ”
20383	20423	20379	20379	I	678	“ Nope . I think it ’s the right choice . Just have to get a job and clean out my apartment . I know someone who will sublet it for next semester . At least that ’s covered . ”
20424	20432	20433	20434	my mother	239	“ Maybe you ’ll change your mind , ”
20441	20456	20433	20434	my mother	239	“ Let me put on my Sunday best , and then we can go . ”
20477	20484	20485	20485	she	239	“ It was not that bad , ”
20488	20503	20485	20485	she	239	“ You ’re right . It was n’t . Probably because you ’re here . ”
20504	20517	20554	20554	She	239	“ You ’re so dramatic . She ’s happy you ’re home . ”
20518	20521	20522	20522	I	678	“ Yeah , ”
20531	20535	20522	20522	I	678	“ Maybe so . ”
20536	20544	20545	20545	Autumn	110	“ Okay , all ready to go , ”
20574	20585	20586	20586	I	678	“ Think Harry Stevenson will be able to resist me ? ”
20592	20611	20586	20586	I	678	“ If we talk about your sex life one more time , I will vomit on your floor . ”
20612	20619	20620	20621	my mother	239	“ We could talk about yours , ”
20624	20629	20630	20630	I	678	“ Let ’s not , ”
20665	20676	20677	20677	Autumn	110	“ I heard that you saw the Wright family yesterday , ”
20680	20687	20688	20688	I	678	“ Good news does travel fast , ”
20783	20806	20807	20808	my mother	239	“ If you had told me that you were in town , I would n’t have had to hear it from Barbara , ”
20827	20850	20820	20820	I	678	“ Tina was there , too . She said you looked very pretty , and all the boys were staring at you . ”
20890	20917	20885	20885	I	678	“ Heidi did my hair and makeup . Only reason anyone looked at me all night . You know , Landon did n’t even recognize me . ”
20918	20921	20922	20922	Kimber	227	“ What ? ”
20925	20933	20922	20922	Kimber	227	“ You did n’t tell me that . ”
20934	20957	20885	20885	I	678	“ So , funny story , Landon did n’t recognize me , and then his wife showed up and flipped her shit . ”
20958	20963	20964	20965	my mother	239	“ Language , Emery , ”
21357	21360	21361	21361	Noah	70	“ Kimber , ”
21405	21419	21396	21396	Kimber	227	“ Hey , baby girl . Are you excited to see Grandma Autumn ? ”
21420	21428	21429	21429	Lilyanne	557	“ It ’s not autumn , Mommy , ”
21437	21442	21429	21429	Lilyanne	557	“ It ’s winter . ”
21443	21446	21447	21447	I	678	“ Actually , ”
21450	21469	21447	21447	I	678	“ the winter solstice is n’t until the twenty - first . So , it still is autumn . ”
21470	21476	21477	21477	Lily	65	“ But it ’s cold , ”
21480	21484	21485	21485	Noah	70	“ Sound logic . ”
21506	21515	21516	21516	Kimber	227	“ So , tell me about seeing Landon , ”
21525	21537	21516	21516	Kimber	227	“ Shh , Kim , we should n’t gossip in church . ”
21543	21565	21538	21538	Kimber	227	“ It ’s not gossip if it comes from the source . Are n’t you all about firsthand accounts in history ? ”
21566	21595	21604	21604	she	227	“ Meh . Let ’s not talk about history right now . I ’ve thought of next to nothing else for nine years . I need a break . ”
21596	21603	21604	21604	she	227	“ A break like Landon Wright ? ”
21607	21618	21604	21604	she	227	“ Uh , no . Landon is married , remember ? ”
21619	21624	21625	21625	Kimber	227	“ Oh , right , ”
21631	21645	21625	21625	Kimber	227	“ Well , there are a lot of other hot guys in town . ”
21661	21666	21667	21667	he	70	“ What was that ? ”
21670	21677	21678	21678	she	227	“ Oh , shush , you ! ”
21721	21738	21739	21739	Kimber	227	“ I ’m just asking if you are looking for some fun while you ’re here , ”
21745	21754	21755	21755	I	678	“ Speaking of hook - ups in church ? ”
21771	21776	21764	21764	Kimber	227	“ You ’re horrible . ”
21777	21780	21781	21782	my mother	239	“ Lilyanne ! ”
21838	21846	21847	21847	I	678	“ She sure loves your little girl , ”
21850	21864	21865	21865	Kimber	227	“ She does . I could n’t have asked for a better grandma , ”
21868	21874	21865	21865	Kimber	227	“ Who would have guessed ? ”
21875	21878	21879	21879	Kimber	227	“ Everyone , ”
21886	21895	21883	21883	she	239	“ Look who just walked in the building . ”
22664	22673	22674	22674	he	2210	“ Hey . Surprised to find you here , ”
22702	22707	22694	22694	I	678	“ Hey . Yeah , ”
22728	22740	22741	22741	he	2210	“ I did n’t realize your family went to church here , ”
22763	22776	22752	22752	Noah	70	“ Yeah . My mom has been going here since … forever . ”
22777	22789	22790	22790	He	2210	“ Right . I did n’t put two and two together . ”
22793	22806	22807	22807	My	678	“ Well , I really came over to apologize about last night . ”
22819	22827	22812	22812	I	678	“ What exactly are you apologizing for ? ”
22851	22855	22856	22856	he	2210	“ Everything apparently , ”
22859	22891	22892	22892	Ha	119	“ I realized that my advances must have been … unwanted . I think I might have pushed you and made you feel … uncomfortable , which was not my intention . ”
22926	22938	22939	22939	I	678	“ You did n’t push your luck . It ’s fine , ”
22984	22995	22978	22978	his	2210	“ I assume you ’ve figured out who I am . ”
22996	23000	23001	23001	he	2210	“ Emery Robinson , ”
23004	23013	23001	23001	he	2210	“ Yes , I know who you are . ”
23014	23025	23026	23026	I	678	“ And see , now , you ’re not interested , ”
23035	23038	23039	23039	he	2210	“ Oh , ”
23048	23053	23039	23039	he	2210	“ but I am . ”
23130	23148	23111	23111	He	278	“ Perhaps we should take this conversation outside . I try to avoid impure thoughts in church . ”
23199	23202	23203	23203	I	678	“ Okay , ”
23248	23252	23238	23238	I	678	“ Okay then . ”
23253	23258	23259	23259	I	678	“ Hey , Kimber , ”
23281	23294	23268	23268	Her	227	“ I’m … I’m just going to go outside , all right ? ”
23295	23298	23299	23299	she	227	“ Sure , ”
23302	23315	23299	23299	she	227	“ Just , um , come find me when Mom is done . ”
23316	23335	23336	23336	Kimber	227	“ Will do . But … if you get another ride home , that ’s okay , too , ”
23405	23410	23411	23411	I	678	“ Good to go , ”
23433	23438	23439	23439	he	2256	“ That ’s it ? ”
23442	23456	23457	23457	He	2256	“ What ? Oh , my phone ? Yeah . Purses are annoying . ”
23467	23483	23457	23457	He	2256	“ Interesting . Why do you think that ? I thought most women loved purses . ”
23491	23537	23484	23484	I	678	“ Yeah , well , I ’m not most women . I think they ’re pretty , but why would I want to lug something around full of junk that I probably wo n’t need , only to hurt myself by carrying the weight around ? ”
23538	23542	23543	23543	he	2256	“ Fair point , ”
23611	23618	23619	23619	I	678	“ This is a little strange , ”
23622	23625	23626	23626	I	678	“ Why ? ”
23634	23646	23647	23647	Jensen	2210	“ I do n’t know … because I dated your brother ? ”
23664	23674	23647	23647	Jensen	2210	“ That was a long time ago , right ? ”
23675	23678	23679	23679	I	678	“ Yeah , ”
23682	23692	23679	23679	I	678	“ You ’re right . It was forever ago . ”
23693	23703	23704	23704	I	678	“ And you ’re away at school right now ? ”
23744	23765	23766	23766	I	678	“ Away is kind of a loose phrase for someone who has n’t lived in Lubbock in almost ten years , ”
23770	23795	23796	23796	he	2210	“ That ’s true , I suppose . It ’s not like many people move back once they ’ve seen the big wide world , ”
23802	23812	23796	23796	he	2210	“ Yeah . There ’s a reason for that . ”
23813	23819	23820	23820	he	2210	“ What would that be ? ”
23897	23913	23914	23914	I	678	“ Because not everyone has a private jet that can fly them wherever they want , ”
23926	23954	23919	23919	I	678	“ Oh God , you know what ? That was really rude . Definitely rude . I do n’t even know if you have a private jet . ”
23955	23959	23960	23960	he	678	“ I do , ”
23974	23987	23960	23960	he	678	“ Okay . Well , even if you didn’t … still rude . ”
23988	23998	23999	23999	Jensen	2210	“ Do you want to go out with me ? ”
24005	24008	24009	24009	I	678	“ What ? ”
24012	24026	24009	24009	I	678	“ I was just rude to you . Why would you want to ? ”
24027	24065	24066	24066	His	678	“ You ’re refreshing . You do n’t have to apologize to me . I ’ve been in your presence for fifteen minutes , and I ’m already certain that I want to continue to do so . ”
24095	24106	24107	24107	I	678	“ But … but you do n’t even know me , ”
24121	24147	24110	24110	I	678	“ That ’s true . However , I would very much like to get to know you , if you ’d let me , Emery . ”
24350	24354	24355	24355	I	678	“ All right , ”
24359	24368	24369	24369	He	678	“ Great . Let me get your number . ”
24394	24407	24387	24387	I	678	“ I was thinking tomorrow night . Does that work for you ? ”
24408	24411	24412	24412	I	678	“ Tomorrow ? ”
24415	24423	24424	24424	he	678	“ Fine , you ’ve convinced me , ”
24430	24435	24424	24424	he	678	“ How about tonight ? ”
24436	24439	24387	24387	I	678	“ Tonight ? ”
24440	24447	24448	24448	he	678	“ We could just go now , ”
24451	24465	24466	24466	My	678	“ I do n’t have a free day , but I can rearrange . ”
24475	24484	24466	24466	My	678	“ You want to see me right now ? ”
24485	24493	24494	24494	He	678	“ I am seeing you right now . ”
24501	24509	24510	24510	I	678	“ And I like what I see . ”
24524	24542	24510	24510	I	678	“ Well , I think maybe tonight would be good . Where do you want to go ? ”
24543	24549	24550	24550	he	678	“ I have an idea , ”
24556	24567	24550	24550	he	678	“ Bring a big coat , and wear something comfortable . ”
24572	24589	24550	24550	he	678	“ You do n’t strike me as a wear - something - comfortable sort of date . ”
24590	24600	24601	24601	he	678	“ It ’s the suit , is n’t it ? ”
24604	24609	24550	24550	he	678	“ I suppose so . ”
24610	24622	24550	24550	he	678	“ I have a question . How do you like sleeping ? ”
24623	24630	24631	24631	I	678	“ What does that even mean ? ”
24637	24658	24631	24631	I	678	“ I love sleeping . Does n’t everyone ? Though I did n’t get much of it in grad school . ”
24659	24672	24673	24673	he	678	“ Okay , good . Do n’t plan on getting any tonight , ”
24677	24683	24684	24684	I	678	“ That ’s awfully presumptuous , ”
24755	24771	24748	24748	I	678	“ Big coat and something comfortable . We ’ll see if I ’m presumptuous tonight . ”
24784	24792	24772	24772	He	678	“ I ca n’t wait until then . ”
24869	24876	24868	24868	Emery	1077	“ I should call and cancel , ”
24904	24913	24885	24885	She	208	“ Why the hell would you do that ? ”
24914	24922	24885	24885	She	208	“ Because he ’s Landon ’s brother ! ”
24923	24926	24927	24927	she	208	“ So ? ”
24932	24953	24927	24927	she	208	“ He ’s smoking hot ! You ’ve already made out with his face . You should so fuck him . ”
24966	24978	24954	24954	I	678	“ Shut up ! We ’re not going to have sex . ”
24979	24990	24991	24991	I	678	“ Sure . Then , why are you wearing that ? ”
25022	25025	25026	25026	I	678	“ What ? ”
25030	25050	25026	25026	I	678	“ I have nothing in my closet . I need to get the rest of my stuff from Austin . ”
25051	25056	25057	25057	she	208	“ Yeah , okay , ”
25068	25078	25061	25061	I	678	“ Is n’t it just a little … weird ? ”
25079	25089	25026	25026	I	678	“ You are the only one making it weird . ”
25090	25104	25105	25105	Heidi	208	“ I think maybe I ’d feel better if I talked to Landon . ”
25108	25123	25105	25105	Heidi	208	“ Now , that ’s something I never thought I ’d hear you say . ”
25124	25130	25131	25131	I	678	“ Oh , shut it , ”
25139	25174	25131	25131	I	678	“ You ’ve talked to Landon twice in over nine years since the breakup , including this weekend ! Other than the sad , sappy messages you left on his voice mail in college . ”
25175	25179	25180	25180	I	678	“ Do n’t , ”
25246	25277	25278	25278	I	678	“ Come on , Em . This will be fine . You thought Jensen Wright was sexy as hell since before you had any interest in Landon . Cut loose . ”
25352	25361	25372	25372	She	674	“ All right . I wo n’t cancel . ”
25362	25371	25372	25372	She	674	“ Excellent . I ’d go with this . ”
25425	25431	25419	25419	I	678	“ What do you think ? ”
25432	25453	25419	25419	I	678	“ I still think a little black dress would be better . Are you sure he said warm and comfortable ? ”
25454	25457	25419	25419	I	678	“ Definitely . ”
25475	25491	25472	25472	Lilyanne	557	“ I ’ll get it . I ’ll get it . I ’ll get it ! ”
25492	25497	25498	25498	I	678	“ He ’s early , ”
25506	25527	25528	25528	Heidi	208	“ Well , hurry up . Go and intercept the minion , or he ’s going to be taking Lily , ”
25588	25594	25586	25586	Ugh	123	“ And who are you ? ”
25650	25659	25660	25660	she	678	“ I ’m Lilyanne . Who are you ? ”
25663	25677	25660	25660	she	678	“ So nice to meet you , Lilyanne . My name is Jensen . ”
25678	25684	25685	25685	she	678	“ Are those for me ? ”
25699	25729	25696	25696	He	2210	“ They most certainly are . Do you have a vase to put them in ? I can show you how to keep them pretty for a long time . ”
25740	25745	25746	25746	she	678	“ Mommy ! Daddy ! ”
25749	25754	25746	25746	she	678	“ I have flowers ! ”
25755	25759	25760	25760	Kimber	227	“ How nice , ”
25763	25771	25760	25760	Kimber	227	“ I think I have a boyfriend ! ”
25800	25815	25792	25792	Noah	70	“ You ’re a little young for a boyfriend , I think . Right ? ”
25816	25819	25820	25820	Kimber	227	“ Yep , ”
25823	25828	25829	25829	Lilyanne	557	“ Much too young . ”
25840	25854	25855	25855	Noah	70	“ Let ’s go with Mom to find something to put them in , ”
25990	25993	25975	25975	Heidi	208	“ Hey , ”
26041	26046	26047	26047	he	2210	“ Hey , Emery , ”
26089	26096	26078	26078	I	678	“ I had flowers for you . ”
26110	26133	26097	26097	I	678	“ That ’s okay . You just made Lily ’s day . She ’s going to be talking about you forever now . ”
26134	26150	26151	26151	I	678	“ Ah , good . She ’s adorable . How old is she ? Four ? ”
26172	26175	26097	26097	I	678	“ Yeah . ”
26176	26183	26097	26097	I	678	“ That ’s a great age . ”
26184	26190	26191	26191	I	678	“ She ’s the best , ”
26282	26289	26290	26290	he	2210	“ I know I ’m early , ”
26293	26321	26290	26290	he	2210	“ I saw that a cold front would be moving through tonight . That was not in the plan , especially with how the wind is now . ”
26322	26327	26328	26328	I	678	“ Only in Texas , ”
26334	26354	26328	26328	I	678	“ The weather is crazy unpredictable . With my luck , we ’ll have a dust storm blow through . ”
26355	26361	26290	26290	he	2210	“ Let ’s hope not . ”
26362	26369	26370	26370	I	678	“ I ’ll get my coat . ”
26410	26413	26400	26400	I	678	“ Ready . ”
26660	26670	26654	26654	he	2210	“ So , what are you in school for ? ”
26719	26729	26711	26711	she	208	“ Um … PhD in history at UT Austin . ”
26745	26753	26737	26737	I	678	“ A PhD ? That ’s incredible . ”
26754	26757	26758	26758	I	678	“ Thanks , ”
26807	26813	26793	26793	I	678	“ What kind of history ? ”
26814	26852	26863	26863	his	2210	“ Oh . European female figures with some interest in European monarchy mistresses . Well , I was writing my dissertation on Madame de Pompadour , who was the renowned mistress of King Louis XV of France . ”
26853	26856	26857	26857	he	2210	“ Mistresses , ”
26866	26876	26857	26857	he	2210	“ There ’s a lot of research on that ? ”
26877	26883	26884	26884	I	678	“ A surprising amount honestly , ”
26888	26902	26903	26903	he	2210	“ Interesting . I always wanted to go back and get another degree , ”
26906	26923	26924	26924	He	2210	“ Pretty hard to do while you ’re running your own business , I would guess . ”
27038	27055	27029	27029	he	2210	“ That would be the main reason . Just too busy to go back to school . ”
27056	27071	27072	27072	I	678	“ Are n’t you in charge though ? Why would you need another degree ? ”
27080	27085	27086	27086	His	2210	“ I would n’t . ”
27226	27234	27221	27221	I	678	“ You ’re taking me for tacos ? ”
27269	27278	27279	27279	He	2210	“ What ? Do you not like tacos ? ”
27284	27292	27296	27296	him	2210	“ Tacos are a deal - breaker . ”
27307	27320	27321	27321	He	2210	“ Of course I like tacos . Do people not like tacos ? ”
27324	27328	27321	27321	He	2210	“ Traitors maybe . ”
27329	27334	27335	27335	I	678	“ You ’re ridiculous , ”
27341	27350	27335	27335	I	678	“ I just did n’t expect … tacos . ”
27351	27357	27358	27358	His	2210	“ What were you expecting ? ”
27397	27417	27335	27335	I	678	“ I do n’t know . I guess I ’m just realizing that you ’re not what I thought . ”
27418	27430	27335	27335	I	678	“ Good . You are n’t what I was expecting either . ”
27431	27441	27335	27335	I	678	“ Oh , yeah ? What were you expecting ? ”
27442	27460	27461	27461	I	678	“ After meeting you yesterday ? A girlie girl who likes makeup and hair and designer clothes . ”
27477	27491	27335	27335	I	678	“ Yes , well , I realize that ’s not who you are . ”
27492	27497	27498	27498	I	678	“ Not even close . ”
27550	27567	27568	27568	I	678	“ Let ’s suspend all preconceived notions about each other then . What do you think ? ”
27571	27577	27568	27568	I	678	“ I ’d like that . ”
27875	27881	27863	27863	she	713	“ What was that about ? ”
27882	27885	27886	27886	she	713	“ Heidi , ”
27959	27996	28004	28004	she	208	“ Heidi ’s great . I do n’t know what we would do without her . Though you ’d never guess that from talking to her about it . How long have you known each other ? ”
28082	28102	28103	28103	she	726	“ That sounds like Heidi . Always the hard worker who acts as if she could n’t care less , ”
28113	28122	28103	28103	she	726	“ We ’ve been best friends basically forever . ”
28123	28131	28132	28132	She	726	“ Well , she ’s lucky then . ”
28140	28158	28159	28159	She	726	“ Nah , I ’m the lucky one . She keeps me on the straight and narrow . ”
28166	28171	28159	28159	She	726	“ Well … mostly . ”
28199	28210	28211	28211	I	678	“ No one wants to be too straight and narrow . ”
28220	28228	28229	28229	She	726	“ I color outside of the lines . ”
28296	28299	28287	28287	I	678	“ Ready ? ”
28307	28313	28300	28300	She	726	“ Tacos on the go ? ”
28314	28321	28322	28322	I	678	“ We have places to be , ”
28394	28398	28399	28399	she	726	“ All right , ”
28405	28410	28399	28399	she	726	“ lead the way . ”
28485	28494	28495	28495	she	726	“ Where the hell are you taking me ? ”
28503	28509	28495	28495	she	726	“ You have n’t guessed ? ”
28516	28549	28495	28495	she	726	“ I mean … I know what ’s out this way , but I have no idea why you would be taking me into the middle of nowhere on a first date . ”
28550	28562	28495	28495	she	726	“ Lubbock , by definition , is the middle of nowhere . ”
28563	28570	28571	28571	she	726	“ That is a fair point , ”
28594	28601	28585	28585	she	726	“ You do n’t like surprises ? ”
28615	28689	28610	28610	she	726	“ I mean … sometimes . Like , surprise , my sister is pregnant , that ’s awesome . But I ’m kind of horrible at this waiting thing . I was that kid who would sneak into my mom ’s closet and peek at my Christmas presents . I called Oklahoma before they announced scholarship letters and convinced the person in administration to tell me whether or not I ’d made it . ”
28730	28737	28738	28738	she	726	“ Do n’t laugh at me , ”
28746	28751	28738	28738	she	726	“ I ’m impatient . ”
28752	28765	28738	28738	she	726	“ I do n’t fault you . I am the same way . ”
28766	28774	28738	28738	she	726	“ So … where are we going ? ”
28775	28781	28784	28784	she	726	“ It ’s a surprise . ”
28789	28798	28784	28784	she	726	“ Ugh ! Okay . I ’ll wait . ”
28860	28864	28865	28865	Emery	128	“ Ransom Canyon ? ”
28960	28969	29064	29064	She	745	“ Have you seen their Christmas lights before ? ”
28970	29021	29064	29064	She	745	“ Nope . I ’ve been here a million times before . We used to go to the lake as kids . I ’ve spent many a summer weekends on boats here . But I did n’t know about the Christmas lights . When did they start to do that ? ”
29022	29054	29064	29064	She	745	“ A couple of years ago . They even have a radio station tuned in so that you can listen to Christmas music as you circle the neighborhood and the lake . ”
29055	29058	29059	29059	Her	745	“ Festive . ”
29088	29097	29072	29072	She	745	“ Are we going to see them all ? ”
29098	29102	29103	29103	I	678	“ Of course , ”
29242	29252	29233	29233	Emery	128	“ Slow down ; you ’re going too fast . ”
29335	29344	29345	29345	Emery	128	“ All I Want for Christmas Is You . ”
29359	29397	29345	29345	Emery	128	“ Oh my God , if I had thought for one second in high school that I would be singing Mariah Carey with Jensen Wright on a real date , I think I would have dropped dead . ”
29398	29406	29407	29407	I	678	“ Hey , do n’t dis Mariah , ”
29410	29416	29407	29407	I	678	“ She ’s an icon . ”
29417	29425	29345	29345	Emery	128	“ She ca n’t even sing anymore ! ”
29426	29439	29440	29440	She	132	“ I ’m going to pretend like you did n’t say that . ”
29448	29458	29440	29440	She	132	“ Oh my God , what is my life ? ”
29459	29464	29465	29465	I	678	“ Seems pretty awesome , ”
29471	29480	29465	29465	I	678	“ Even if you do n’t like Mariah . ”
29481	29487	29488	29488	she	132	“ I do like Mariah ! ”
29491	29499	29488	29488	she	132	“ Stop twisting my words , you ! ”
29500	29507	29508	29508	Her	132	“ I ’m not twisting anything . ”
29790	29798	29799	29799	she	761	“ Are you going to kiss me ? ”
30172	30183	30196	30196	Jensen	2210	“ Fuck ! I did n’t mean to do that . ”
30184	30195	30196	30196	Jensen	2210	“ It ’s fine . You should kiss me again , ”
30338	30345	30330	30330	she	774	“ Fuck . Fuck . Fuck ! ”
30423	30435	30436	30436	He	2210	“ Come on . We have to get out of here . ”
30452	30455	30456	30456	I	678	“ Jensen , ”
30462	30469	30456	30456	I	678	“ get your cute ass moving . ”
30470	30477	30478	30478	he	2210	“ All right , all right , ”
30505	30516	30517	30517	I	678	“ So long as you think my ass is cute . ”
30611	30620	30608	30608	my	678	“ I can not believe that just happened . ”
30621	30628	30629	30629	he	2210	“ It was n’t that bad , ”
30648	30659	30642	30642	I	678	“ What is your definition of was n’t that bad ? ”
30660	30678	30642	30642	I	678	“ You do n’t know that woman , and you ’ll never have to see her again . ”
30679	30685	30686	30686	Jensen	2210	“ Not with my luck ! ”
30695	30702	30689	30689	his	2210	“ Emery , look at me . ”
30715	30718	30689	30689	his	2210	“ What ? ”
30719	30733	30689	30689	his	2210	“ Do n’t be embarrassed . I thought it was sexy as hell . ”
30734	30738	30739	30739	I	678	“ Getting caught ? ”
30751	30758	30759	30759	he	2210	“ The way you rode me , ”
30848	30853	30854	30854	I	678	“ You liked that ? ”
30862	30878	30879	30879	he	2210	“ I ’d like to do more than let you ride me in my truck , ”
30922	30937	30915	30915	I	678	“ I ’d love to get you to make those moaning noises all night . ”
30953	30961	30962	30962	he	2210	“ I would n’t mind this either , ”
30977	30983	30984	30984	I	678	“ Oh , dear God , ”
31001	31008	30997	30997	we	787	“ Is that what you want ? ”
31009	31016	31017	31017	I	678	“ For you to fuck me ? ”
31034	31047	31020	31020	He	2210	“ I ’d like nothing more than to fuck you , Emery . ”
31373	31379	31380	31380	I	678	“ Whose house is this ? ”
31404	31407	31395	31395	he	2210	“ Mine . ”
31408	31411	31412	31412	I	678	“ Oh , ”
31471	31480	31481	31481	he	2210	“ I originally planned to bring you here , ”
31494	31543	31489	31489	he	2210	“ Not like that . I planned to use the fire pit and make s’mores . I have the supplies in the back . I figured it ’d be about fifty degrees , and if the weather permitted , we could night hike . Hence the warm clothes … ”
31647	31654	31655	31655	he	2210	“ We could still do that , ”
31658	31679	31655	31655	he	2210	“ Though it has dropped down to twenty with a wind chill of eleven . So … we might freeze . ”
31680	31693	31694	31694	I	678	“ You turned the car off , so I ’m already freezing , ”
31720	31732	31710	31710	I	678	“ Let ’s get you inside and warm you up then . ”
31898	31901	31902	31902	Jensen	2210	“ Brr , ”
31917	31954	31905	31905	He	2210	“ I ’m going to build a fire . If you want to look in that crate right there , there ’s a bunch of blankets . Make yourself at home while I get some firewood . ”
32162	32174	32175	32175	he	2210	“ Why do n’t you come get closer to the fire ? ”
32203	32212	32200	32200	I	678	“ Did that thing used to be alive ? ”
32213	32216	32217	32217	he	2210	“ Synthetic , ”
32221	32226	32217	32217	he	2210	“ Just as warm . ”
32300	32307	32288	32288	He	2210	“ I hope you like red . ”
32308	32313	32314	32314	I	678	“ Red or champagne . ”
32329	32338	32314	32314	I	678	“ And since we did n’t get to do s’mores”—he
32364	32372	32314	32314	I	678	it—“I thought this would have to do . ”
32373	32382	32383	32383	I	678	“ This had better be a dessert wine , ”
32459	32475	32476	32476	I	678	“ If I did n’t know better , I ’d think you were seducing me , ”
32479	32492	32493	32493	His	2210	“ I think I made my intentions pretty clear in the truck . ”
32583	32586	32587	32587	he	2210	“ But , ”
32601	32634	32587	32587	he	2210	“ I would be okay if you just wanted a nice fire , some good wine , and deconstructed s’mores . I could get you home at a semi decent hour even . ”
32696	32710	32711	32711	I	678	“ What happened to , do n’t plan on getting any sleep tonight ? ”
33100	33103	33104	33104	he	2210	“ Emery , ”
33165	33171	33172	33172	he	2210	“ Holy fuck , woman , ”
33254	33258	33236	33236	He	2210	“ Oh God , ”
33412	33418	33419	33419	he	2210	“ I take it back , ”
33448	33480	33435	33435	He	2210	“ I like your screams as you come better than your groans as you ride me . I wonder if I would like your screams as you rode me the best . ”
33481	33489	33490	33490	I	678	“ Do you want to find out ? ”
33494	33507	33508	33508	He	2210	“ I want to find all the ways to make you scream . ”
33522	33529	33515	33515	I	678	“ Fuck , woman . Fuck . ”
33565	33568	33569	33569	I	678	“ Please , ”
33572	33583	33584	33584	he	2210	“ Oh , I do like when you ask nicely , ”
33590	33598	33599	33599	I	678	“ Then , let me try again , ”
33609	33627	33599	33599	I	678	“ Please , oh , please , Jensen Wright , fuck me . Fuck me right now . ”
33681	33695	33696	33696	Jensen	2210	“ I ’d like to give you what you want , Miss Robinson , ”
33706	33718	33696	33696	Jensen	2210	“ I might have to hear you ask one more time . ”
33750	33776	33743	33743	he	2210	“ I want you inside me . All of you . Until you have me screaming again from your cock and not just your mouth . ”
33777	33780	33781	33781	he	2210	“ Fuck , ”
33919	33928	33929	33929	He	2210	“ Jensen , God , please . Harder . ”
34046	34049	34050	34050	I	678	“ Wow , ”
34053	34058	34050	34050	I	678	“ Holy fucking wow . ”
34059	34066	34050	34050	I	678	“ You can say that again . ”
34067	34079	34050	34050	I	678	“ We’re … we’re going to need to do that again . ”
34080	34085	34086	34086	Jensen	2210	“ A few times . ”
34307	34310	34311	34311	Emery	1077	“ Mmm , ”
34403	34409	34410	34410	she	813	“ What time is it ? ”
34413	34416	34410	34410	she	813	“ Nine . ”
34417	34421	34422	34422	She	813	“ That early ? ”
34428	34431	34432	34432	I	678	“ Mmhmm , ”
34629	34643	34644	34644	I	678	“ I ’ll just … get your things , so we can go , ”
34855	34861	34862	34862	I	678	“ Just late for work , ”
34866	34873	34862	34862	I	678	“ We have to get going . ”
34874	34880	34881	34881	she	331	“ Right . Of course , ”
34966	34970	34940	34940	Emery	1077	“ All ready . ”
34971	34974	34975	34975	We	827	“ Great . ”
35044	35050	35051	35051	she	331	“ Have fun at work , ”
35116	35125	35131	35131	she	331	“ Thanks . Have fun with your sister . ”
35126	35130	35131	35131	she	331	“ My sister , ”
35135	35144	35145	35145	She	331	“ Okay . Well , um … bye . ”
35195	35198	35191	35191	her	331	“ Shit , ”
35353	35360	35361	35361	she	107	“ Good morning , Mr. Wright , ”
35379	35472	35361	35361	she	107	“ Mr. McCoy called this morning , said it was urgent about the merger , sir . You also had a call from Vanessa . Well , two calls , but I let one go to voice mail . Nick Brown left a message about canceling his appointment because he ’s going out of town . Alex Langley called out sick . Personally , it sounded like he was out late and hungover . Elizabeth Copeland had an important update on the Lakeridge complex , sir . Sounded rather urgent as well . ”
35473	35476	35477	35477	I	678	“ Margaret , ”
35491	35496	35497	35497	She	843	“ Yes , sir ? ”
35512	35544	35497	35497	She	843	“ I feel a bit under the weather . Cancel all of my appointments for the day and let Mr. McCoy know that I ’ll handle the merger in the morning . ”
35545	35550	35551	35551	she	843	“ But , sir — ”
35555	35564	35551	35551	she	843	“ Margaret , let me run my company . ”
35565	35569	35570	35570	she	843	“ Of course , ”
35587	35597	35598	35598	I	678	“ Also , Morgan is waiting in your office . ”
35602	35613	35598	35598	I	678	“ Thank you , Margaret . That will be all . ”
35653	35657	35658	35658	she	843	“ Late night ? ”
35665	35668	35658	35658	she	843	“ Indeed . ”
35706	35716	35717	35717	She	843	“ What ’s with the late start , bro ? ”
35737	35742	35743	35743	Morgan	86	“ I slept in . ”
35750	35765	35766	35766	I	678	“ Yeah , right ! You do n’t sleep . You ’re a vampire . ”
35787	35796	35769	35769	I	678	“ Do n’t know what to tell you . ”
35797	35811	35812	35812	she	843	“ How about who you were fucking when you slept in this morning ? ”
35841	35851	35822	35822	I	678	“ Wait … do I even want to know ? ”
35852	35856	35857	35857	I	678	“ Probably not , ”
35893	35903	35904	35904	she	843	“ Okay , whatever . Landon called this morning , ”
35915	35919	35920	35920	She	843	“ What for ? ”
35925	35940	35941	35941	I	678	“ Miranda , of course . Why ? Why do you look so scared ? ”
35952	35959	35941	35941	I	678	“ What did Miranda do now ? ”
35960	35971	35972	35972	Morgan	86	“ She wants to keep him in Tampa for Christmas , ”
35981	35991	35992	35992	I	678	“ He ’s not considering it , is he ? ”
35998	36004	35995	35995	She	843	“ I guess he is . ”
36014	36044	36005	36005	I	678	“ I ’ll call him right now and set him straight . He ca n’t stay there because of Miranda . It ’s Christmas , for Christ ’s sake . ”
36045	36067	36068	36068	Morgan	86	“ I know , Jensen . Miranda has it in her head that Emery Robinson is here to win Landon back , ”
36077	36083	36084	36084	I	678	“ That seems very unlikely , ”
36099	36108	36087	36087	I	678	“ She ’s leaving in a few days . ”
36109	36112	36113	36113	Morgan	86	“ What ? ”
36116	36133	36113	36113	Morgan	86	“ No , she ’s not . Landon said she was staying here for a while . ”
36134	36139	36140	36140	I	678	“ He … what ? ”
36148	36235	36236	36236	I	678	“ He tried to tell Miranda that she ’d be leaving soon to get her off his case . But she did n’t believe him , and it turned out , she had a reason . Emery told Landon at Sutton ’s wedding that she was staying here indefinitely . But I mean … I do n’t know why Emery is back in town , but it sure is n’t for Landon . He does n’t even live here . Miranda is out of her mind . ”
36316	36319	36320	36320	I	678	“ Shit , ”
36323	36373	36374	36374	Morgan	86	“ Right ? So , you have to call and convince Landon to bring Miranda here for Christmas . Do whatever you have to , all right ? I mean … I can even call Emery or whatever and ask her to stay away from Landon if that helps … ”
36382	36389	36374	36374	Morgan	86	“ Why have you gone pale . ”
36390	36393	36394	36394	I	678	“ Morg , ”
36402	36407	36409	36409	Emery	1077	“ I fucked up . ”
36410	36425	36426	36426	I	678	“ And he just threw my clothes at me and then drove me home ! ”
36433	36436	36437	36437	Heidi	208	“ Bastard ! ”
36442	36447	36437	36437	Heidi	208	“ What a bastard ! ”
36448	36495	36437	36437	Heidi	208	“ Right ? I mean … we had sex for hours last night , and then this morning , it was like a light switch had been flipped . Walking into this , I just knew it was a bad idea . He totally used me . ”
36496	36507	36508	36508	Heidi	208	“ And it sucked , using him back , right ? ”
36529	36537	36538	36538	I	678	“ Dude , the sex was phenomenal , ”
36546	36575	36538	36538	I	678	“ The turning into a jerk in the morning and dumping me at Kimber ’s , like a dorm - level walk of shame , not so much . ”
36633	36645	36646	36646	Heidi	208	“ Yeah , well , at least you had some fun , ”
36649	36659	36646	36646	Heidi	208	“ That was good for you after Professor McJerkface . ”
36675	36679	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ Professor McJerkface ? ”
36687	36691	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ Pretty much . ”
36692	36712	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ Well , it was a good time . But , you know … it was more than that . ”
36726	36733	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ I kind of like him . ”
36734	36739	36740	36740	Heidi	208	“ A Wright brother ? ”
36746	36760	36740	36740	Heidi	208	“ Are n’t you President of the Anti - Wright Family Fan Club ? ”
36761	36766	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ Something like that , ”
36770	36776	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ But he was different . ”
36777	36786	36787	36787	Heidi	208	“ Oh , boy ! Here it goes , ”
36790	36793	36794	36794	I	678	“ What ? ”
36797	36804	36794	36794	I	678	“ You ’re doing that thing . ”
36805	36809	36680	36680	Heidi	208	“ What thing ? ”
36810	36814	36815	36815	Heidi	208	“ You know , ”
36818	36851	36852	36852	I	678	“ The whole the guy is a jerk , but he ’s different with me . News flash , Robinson , he ’s not different . He just wanted to fuck you . ”
36855	36862	36852	36852	I	678	“ Thanks for that cheery message . ”
36863	36890	36794	36794	I	678	“ Gah , I ’m sorry . I had a weird night , and I worry about you . What happened with Landon was bad enough . ”
36891	36903	36794	36794	I	678	“ You were the one pushing me into Jensen ’s arms . ”
36904	36988	36852	36852	I	678	“ Yeah , but that was before you got all doe - eyed and decided he was different . I like Jensen just fine . He ’s a great boss . He cares about his employees . He knows what he ’s doing , and he makes us all a lot of money . But I ca n’t pretend that he ’s this perfect person either . I ’ve heard that he sleeps around when he ’s at business meetings out of town . ”
36989	37039	36794	36794	I	678	“ Ugh ! I do n’t want to think about it . We ’ve all done stupid things . I do n’t want to judge him . Maybe he ’s just a manwhore , and that ’s what last night was about . But you should have warned me ! ”
37040	37065	36794	36794	I	678	“ I thought you ’d fuck around with him as a nice rebound , Em . I did n’t think it ’d be anything . ”
37066	37073	37074	37074	I	678	“ Well , it ’s not , ”
37078	37122	37074	37074	I	678	“ It ’s definitely not . Remember the whole dropped me off at Kim ’s like he was taking out the trash ? Because I ’m pretty sure , no matter how different he was with me , that asshole sure shone through . ”
37123	37141	36794	36794	I	678	“ Good . That ’s good . I do n’t want to see you get hurt again . ”
37142	37161	37162	37162	I	678	“ I ’m not going to get hurt . Now , what was this about a weird night ? ”
37178	37204	37166	37166	She	850	“ Nothing honestly . I had a strange phone call , and I ended up talking to the person all night . It was unexpected . ”
37221	37236	37212	37212	Heidi	208	“ Do you want to go shopping with me and Julia sometime this week ? ”
37237	37249	37168	37168	her	850	“ Two weeks before Christmas . Your favorite time to shop . ”
37250	37267	37212	37212	Heidi	208	“ All the crowds and sales and screaming — it makes for a great horror flick . ”
37268	37285	37212	37212	Heidi	208	“ Sure , I ’m in . I can never resist a good bit of horror . ”
37294	37297	37298	37298	I	678	“ Fuck , ”
37387	37395	37381	37381	I	678	“ Let me guess … lover boy ? ”
37396	37399	37400	37400	I	678	“ Yeah . ”
37479	37487	37488	37488	I	678	“ What does he have to say ? ”
37496	37504	37488	37488	I	678	“ I ’m way more confused now . ”
37505	37516	37517	37517	Heidi	208	“ He wants to meet you at Kimber ’s bakery ? ”
37523	37536	37517	37517	Heidi	208	“ I ’m sure he does n’t know that she owns it . ”
37537	37584	37488	37488	I	678	“ True , but damn . I wonder what happened in his head . Besides the fact that canceling meetings is so not like him . I ’ve never heard of him willfully canceling a meeting . He must have realized how much he fucked up . ”
37585	37588	37517	37517	Heidi	208	“ Maybe . ”
37589	37596	37597	37597	I	678	“ Or he wants round two . ”
37607	37613	37597	37597	I	678	“ There ’s no way . ”
37614	37624	37517	37517	Heidi	208	“ Well , are you going to meet him ? ”
37625	37632	37633	37633	I	678	“ Did curiosity kill the cat ? ”
37637	37648	37651	37651	Chocolate	146	“ Yeah , but it had nine lives and shit . ”
37711	37740	37741	37741	I	678	“ Cupcakes in the morning , cookies in the evening , chocolate at suppertime . When Kimber ’s in the kitchen , you can eat baked goods anytime , ”
37849	37855	37856	37857	a girl	726	“ Can I help you ? ”
37875	37891	37860	37860	She	726	“ I ’ll take a snickerdoodle cookie and two of the strawberry macarons , please . ”
37892	37902	37903	37903	Jensen	2210	“ And a slice of death by chocolate cake , ”
37920	37927	37909	37909	I	678	“ Jesus , you scared me . ”
37928	37949	37950	37950	he	2210	“ I did n’t mean to sneak up on you . I thought you ’d have heard the bell chime , ”
38071	38076	38077	38077	I	678	“ It ’s fine , ”
38125	38132	38133	38134	the woman	863	“ Anything else for you two ? ”
38145	38154	38155	38155	I	678	“ I ’ll take a cup of coffee , ”
38158	38163	38155	38155	I	678	“ Make that two . ”
38189	38195	38184	38184	He	2210	“ I ’ve got it . ”
38196	38205	38206	38206	I	678	“ I can pay for my own things , ”
38210	38228	38229	38229	His	2210	“ I know you can , but I invited you here . So , I ’m paying . ”
38267	38275	38254	38254	I	678	“ I ’ll get us a table . ”
38368	38371	38372	38372	he	2210	“ Emery , ”
38375	38378	38372	38372	he	2210	“ I … ”
38403	38406	38391	38391	I	678	“ What ? ”
38407	38417	38391	38391	I	678	“ I think I ’ve made a horrible mistake . ”
38418	38425	38391	38391	I	678	“ And what would that be ? ”
38426	38434	38435	38435	he	2210	“ Going on a date with you , ”
38454	38467	38391	38391	I	678	“ Well , that ’s just … that ’s wonderful , Jensen . ”
38468	38480	38391	38391	I	678	“ Emery , sit down . Come on , just sit . ”
38481	38487	38488	38488	I	678	“ And why should I ? ”
38500	38535	38488	38488	I	678	“ We had an awesome time last night , and then poof , you turned into an asshole . Then , you invited me here , only to tell me you regret last night ? ”
38536	38541	38542	38542	he	2210	“ Emery , please , ”
38570	38575	38576	38576	I	678	“ Let me explain . ”
38583	38587	38576	38576	I	678	“ Explain what ? ”
38588	38634	38635	38635	he	2210	“ I thought you were getting your PhD. I thought you said you were still at school in Austin , studying history and European mistresses . That ’s what you told me . That ’s what I thought . But you ’re not doing that , ”
38643	38649	38576	38576	I	678	“ What do you mean ? ”
38650	38661	38662	38662	he	2210	“ You ’re staying in town , are n’t you ? ”
38672	38698	38699	38699	I	678	“ How could you possibly know that ? I ’ve told only a handful of people , and even my mom does n’t believe me , ”
38703	38709	38710	38710	he	2210	“ Because you told Landon , ”
38716	38722	38723	38723	I	678	“ You talked to Landon ? ”
38726	38730	38710	38710	he	2210	“ About me ? ”
38731	38736	38710	38710	he	2210	“ Not … exactly . ”
38737	38749	38750	38750	I	678	“ You did n’t tell him what happened , did you ? ”
38758	38810	38750	38750	I	678	“ Look , I did n’t talk to him . Morgan did . His wife is still pissed that you ’re here . Morgan did n’t know about what happened with us . So , no , he does n’t know . And I ’d like to keep it that way . ”
38811	38828	38829	38829	Jensen	2210	“ You said … didn’t know . Morgan did n’t know , but she does now ? ”
38833	38841	38829	38829	Jensen	2210	“ It was kind of an accident . ”
38842	38850	38851	38851	I	678	“ Oh , for the love of … ”
38857	38883	38851	38851	I	678	“ You do n’t want Landon to find out about your big mistake , but you told Morgan ? Are you out of your mind ? ”
38884	38891	38892	38892	he	2210	“ Starting to feel like it , ”
38895	38924	38892	38892	he	2210	“ Great . You brought me all the way here to tell me what a big mistake I was and that Landon is probably going to find out . ”
38954	39004	39005	39005	I	678	“ It ’s not like that . It ’s more a matter of principle , Emery . I had a great time , but I do n’t date girls in town . And , if I had known you were staying , I never would have asked you out . ”
39075	39102	39060	39060	he	2210	“ I guessed that when you dropped me off this morning . You did n’t need to come here to tell me that to my face , ”
39121	39146	39112	39112	I	678	“ Have a macaron . They ’re my sister ’s favorite . She owns this bakery . She ’d want you to have one . ”
39155	39158	39159	39159	he	2210	“ Emery , ”
39201	39208	39188	39188	He	2210	“ Emery . Hey , stop . ”
39209	39212	39213	39213	I	678	“ Why ? ”
39216	39229	39213	39213	I	678	“ We had one night together . What am I to you ? ”
39230	39236	39237	39237	he	2210	“ I do n’t know ! ”
39242	39275	39237	39237	he	2210	“ I do n’t know , all right ? It ’s like some goddamn self - preservation kicked in , and I had to stop this before it got out of hand . ”
39276	39286	39287	39287	I	678	“ How could it possibly get out of hand ? ”
39290	39300	39287	39287	I	678	“ Because being with you breaks all the rules ! ”
39301	39309	39237	39237	he	2210	“ Rules are meant to be broken . ”
39310	39315	39316	39316	I	678	“ Not these rules . ”
39319	39348	39349	39349	I	678	“ I have rules , too . I swore , I ’d never look at another person from the Wright family . I decided Wright is n’t right , ”
39358	39364	39349	39349	I	678	“ Yet here we are . ”
39547	39552	39553	39553	I	678	“ How dare you ! ”
39556	39605	39553	39553	I	678	“ You can not send me mixed signals like this , Jensen . Either you want more or you do n’t . I wo n’t play games with you . I ’m tired of being jerked around by men who think that they can do whatever they want . ”
39606	39613	39619	39619	I	678	“ Emery , that ’s not — ”
39614	39618	39619	39619	I	678	“ Save it , ”
39629	39635	39619	39619	I	678	“ I ’ve heard enough . ”
39759	39770	39771	39771	Betty	118	“ Hi , Emery , dear . How are you ? ”
39791	39800	39801	39801	I	678	“ Doing all right . How about yourself ? ”
39821	39837	39838	39838	I	678	“ I ’m just fine . This way . Oh , you know the way . ”
39848	39874	39838	39838	I	678	“ I ’m dreadfully sorry that we ’re closed today . We had to do some maintenance and decided to shut down during the holidays . ”
39875	39878	39879	39879	I	678	“ Maintenance ? ”
39882	39918	39919	39919	Better	148	“ Replace the floors , new roof — that sort of thing . Wright Construction offered to do the whole thing at a discount since we ’re a historic museum . Is n’t that wonderful ? ”
39932	39936	39937	39937	I	678	“ Just wonderful , ”
39950	39961	39937	39937	I	678	“ That Jensen Wright came over to tell me himself . ”
39962	39969	39970	39970	I	678	“ That was nice of him , ”
39976	39981	39982	39982	Betty	118	“ Here we are , ”
39985	40029	39982	39982	Betty	118	“ Thank you for being able to meet with me today . I ’m going to Florida to visit my grandbabies for Christmas , and I wo n’t be back until after the New Year . It would have delayed everything for you . ”
40030	40059	40060	40060	I	678	“ This is great . I appreciate you coming in early for me . Who is going to be here to let people in for the construction crew ? ”
40084	40117	39982	39982	Betty	118	“ We have a few people who will be here for the holidays . They have keys and can alternate days . But we ’re closed up from Christmas to New Years . ”
40118	40135	39982	39982	Betty	118	“ Well , if you need someone , let me know . I will be around . ”
40136	40165	40166	40166	she	118	“ I ’m sure they would love to work you into the schedule . Let me get you a copy of the key while we ’re at it , ”
40593	40607	40608	40608	I	678	“ I ’m here . I made it . Sorry I ’m late , ”
40614	40621	40622	40622	Heidi	208	“ Em ! Just in time , ”
40625	40638	40622	40622	Heidi	208	“ Tell Julia that she would look smoking hot in this dress . ”
40639	40648	40652	40652	my	678	“ It ’s black . I like it . ”
40682	40690	40691	40691	Heidi	208	“ I knew you would say that , ”
40832	40846	40813	40813	she	205	“ It ’s so not me , but I ’ll try it on . ”
40847	40857	40858	40858	I	678	“ Nothing in this store is ever me either , ”
40862	40889	40858	40858	I	678	“ But , if you do n’t try on everything Heidi wants you to wear , then you wo n’t make it out of here alive . ”
40890	40894	40895	40895	Heidi	208	“ Damn straight , ”
40905	40915	40895	40895	Heidi	208	“ Now , let me play dress - up ! ”
41033	41044	41045	41045	Heidi	208	“ Okay , I know it ’s a touchy subject , ”
41053	41061	41045	41045	Heidi	208	“ but can we talk about Jensen ? ”
41081	41084	41074	41074	she	208	“ No . ”
41085	41090	41091	41091	Julia	100	“ What about Jensen ? ”
41118	41123	41124	41124	Heidi	208	“ Can I tell ? ”
41127	41144	41145	41145	I	678	“ Fine , but I ’m not trying on that weird patterned thing you gave me , ”
41149	41164	41145	41145	I	678	“ Ugh ! Fine ! I ’m just trying to brighten up your wardrobe . ”
41165	41181	41182	41182	She	100	“ You ’ve been trying for twenty years . It ’s not going to work . ”
41189	41200	41182	41182	She	100	“ Anyway , Emery went on a date with Jensen . ”
41201	41210	41211	41211	Julia	100	“ Oh , wow ! Was it hot ? ”
41214	41218	41219	41219	Heidi	208	“ So hot , ”
41222	41229	41230	41230	I	678	“ Heidi , can you not ? ”
41233	41236	41237	41237	she	208	“ Sorry ! ”
41240	41275	41237	41237	she	208	“ Anyway , he was a total ass to her afterward , and then he was an even bigger ass by asking her to coffee to tell her the whole thing was a mistake . ”
41276	41284	41285	41285	Julia	100	“ That sucks . Sorry , Emery , ”
41288	41293	41294	41294	I	678	“ It ’s fine , ”
41298	41367	41294	41294	I	678	“ Really , it was one date . And then … another kiss that meant nothing . He kissed me after telling me how much of a mistake our date was because he does n’t date in town and how it never should have happened because I moved back home . Oh ! And he fucking told Morgan . Now , Landon is totally going to find out . ”
41368	41383	41384	41384	Julia	100	“ And Landon does n’t know you went on a date with his brother ? ”
41392	41402	41387	41387	I	678	“ I ’d like to keep it that way . ”
41477	41487	41488	41488	Heidi	208	“ Yeah , but he ’s still messaging you , ”
41491	41499	41500	41500	Julia	100	“ Then , he must like you , ”
41503	41513	41500	41500	Julia	100	“ Maybe he ’s just … bad at communication . ”
41514	41527	41500	41500	Julia	100	“ Just what I want in a guy . A bad communicator . ”
41528	41536	41537	41537	Julia	100	“ That ’s not what I meant , ”
41540	41588	41589	41589	I	678	“ I mean , what if he is scared of how he feels for you ? You said he did n’t date in town . Maybe it freaked him out when he realized that you were going to live here , and he said things all wrong . ”
41597	41634	41589	41589	I	678	“ Jensen Wright does not say things wrong . He is a businessman . He says what he means and takes what he wants . I feel that I have to take him at face value . ”
41635	41640	41641	41641	Julia	100	“ That seems fair , ”
41644	41661	41662	41662	I	678	“ But the real question is it worth always having that what - if with him ? ”
41679	41690	41691	41691	Heidi	208	“ Just go into it with your eyes wide open , ”
41694	41758	41691	41691	Heidi	208	“ You know he has baggage and shit . He ’s a Wright . He ’s filthy rich and sleeps with supermodels and all that . You know his deal . If you can live with him flying to New York every holiday , then who am I to stop you from having some fun ? I just want you to be happy . ”
41759	41768	41769	41769	Julia	100	“ Also , that dress is fucking hot , ”
41845	41850	41851	41851	Heidi	208	“ You need it , ”
41856	41867	41851	41851	Heidi	208	“ I mean , you really , really need it . ”
41881	41896	41851	41851	Heidi	208	“ It ’s three hundred dollars . I do n’t need it that bad . ”
41897	41924	41925	41925	Heidi	208	“ Oh , but you do ! And … I have n’t gotten you a Christmas present yet . So , that can be my present ! ”
41928	41952	41925	41925	Heidi	208	“ Psht ! Are you insane ? I ’m not letting you get me a three - hundred - dollar dress for Christmas . ”
41953	41957	41851	41851	Heidi	208	“ Why not ? ”
41958	41998	41851	41851	Heidi	208	“ Because I could never repay you for a present like that . Anyway , where would I even wear this ? I live in jeans and T - shirts . I would get no use out of it . ”
41999	42002	42003	42003	Heidi	208	“ Actually , ”
42009	42013	42014	42014	I	678	“ Oh no , ”
42020	42038	42014	42014	I	678	“ You ’re about to tell me the real reason we ’re shopping , are n’t you ? ”
42039	42073	42074	42074	My	678	“ There ’s a Christmas party I want you to come to with me and Julia on Friday night . And I thought we could all get our dresses for the party here ! ”
42080	42094	42074	42074	My	678	“ Where ’s the party ? I know she wo n’t tell me . ”
42095	42098	42014	42014	I	678	“ Uh … ”
42099	42111	42014	42014	I	678	“ Come on , Em . It ’s just one party . ”
42112	42131	42132	42132	I	678	“ Yeah , and it was just one wedding . Look how well that worked out for me , ”
42136	42161	42162	42162	Julia	100	“ I think it worked out pretty well . You ’re not thinking about Professor McJerkface , and you had a lot of sex . ”
42172	42176	42162	42162	Julia	100	“ Professor McJerkface ? ”
42177	42184	42185	42185	I	678	“ It ’s a long story , ”
42189	42195	42196	42196	Heidi	208	“ Okay , picture this , ”
42199	42239	42196	42196	Heidi	208	“ You wear that dress . I do your hair and makeup . You borrow Kimber ’s stilettos , the really fancy Louboutins that crush your pinkie toes . But how can you resist the red - lacquered bottoms ? ”
42250	42292	42196	42196	Heidi	208	“ You walk into the party . All eyes fall on you . You ’re like fucking Cinderella for a moment . And then , poof , your Prince Charming shows up , and voilà , the night has endless possibilities . ”
42293	42297	42298	42298	I	678	“ Oh God , ”
42303	42313	42314	42314	Heidi	208	“ You ’re talking about your office Christmas party . ”
42320	42325	42314	42314	Heidi	208	“ Um … yes . ”
42326	42363	42196	42196	Heidi	208	“ And , when you say endless possibilities , you mean , I trip over my feet in front of Jensen , and he ’s the same jerk he was and laughs at me or something . ”
42364	42370	42314	42314	Heidi	208	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
42371	42389	42390	42390	Julia	100	“ Yeah , really , I do n’t think Jensen would ever laugh at someone like that , ”
42393	42416	42390	42390	Julia	100	“ Plus , it wo n’t suck because , it ’s open bar , and we can all get wasted on champagne . ”
42417	42424	42425	42425	I	678	“ Oh , I like you , ”
42429	42441	42442	42442	Heidi	208	“ See , Em ? ! Please , please , please , ”
42445	42452	42442	42442	Heidi	208	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
42453	42456	42457	42457	Heidi	208	“ Yes ! ”
42466	42473	42474	42474	Julia	100	“ While we ’re at it , ”
42486	42513	42474	42474	Julia	100	“ want to find me something that sexy ? There ’s a Wright brother I would n’t mind looking at me twice in something like that . ”
42514	42517	42518	42518	Heidi	208	“ Landon ? ”
42528	42531	42518	42518	Heidi	208	“ Austin ? ”
42542	42552	42532	42532	I	678	“ Landon does n’t even work for Wright Construction . ”
42553	42558	42559	42559	she	100	“ Process of elimination , ”
42563	42568	42559	42559	she	100	“ So , Austin ? ”
42569	42612	42532	42532	I	678	“ I think he ’s scared of me because I work in HR . But he ’s not technically my boss ; Jensen is . I do n’t think we could get in trouble . And I ’m head of HR anyway . ”
42613	42622	42623	42623	Heidi	208	“ Oh , I can find you something , ”
42626	42643	42623	42623	Heidi	208	“ Each of my girls with a Wright brother will be my New Year ’s resolution . ”
42644	42649	42650	42650	I	678	“ You kill me , ”
42659	42669	42670	42670	I	678	“ I ’m not letting you buy the dress . ”
43065	43091	43092	43092	Patrick	278	“ Tell me again that the girl from the wedding is Landon ’s ex - girlfriend . It ’s funnier every time you say it , ”
43107	43115	43095	43095	I	678	“ How about we skip that part ? ”
43116	43121	43122	43122	Patrick	278	“ Okay , okay , ”
43136	43159	43125	43125	He	278	“ I ’m just imagining you striking out now . I ’ve seen you pick up more girls than most famous athletes . ”
43160	43167	43168	43168	I	678	“ I did n’t strike out , ”
43175	43198	43168	43168	I	678	“ Yeah , y’ all fucked , and then she straight fucked with your head . What were you thinking , man ? ”
43199	43212	43213	43213	I	678	“ I was thinking that things were too complicated with Emery already , ”
43279	43282	43283	43283	Patrick	278	“ Complicated ? ”
43316	43336	43351	43351	his	278	“ Shit ’s not complicated , Jensen . You like her . That ’s why you ’re freaking out . ”
43337	43344	43345	43345	I	678	“ That would be a problem , ”
43367	43409	43359	43359	He	278	“ The problem is with your head , man . Get in good while you can . You do n’t know if things will go south , and stressing about it will only ruin it . Enjoy it while it lasts . ”
43519	43523	43524	43524	Morgan	86	“ Y’all ready ? ”
43611	43616	43617	43617	I	678	“ Yeah . Austin ? ”
43687	43694	43695	43695	Austin	1648	“ Good to go , bro , ”
43710	43717	43698	43698	He	1648	“ Let ’s get upstairs then , ”
44120	44131	44132	44132	I	678	“ Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention ? ”
44172	44222	44223	44225	A few people	392	“ I do n’t want to take up too much of your time . I just wanted to say thank you so much for all that you do for this company . Every single person in this room is integral to the development and continual progress of Wright Construction . ”
44242	44271	44233	44233	everyone	211	“ Additionally , I wanted to make you all aware that , as of next week , Wright Construction will merge with the Tarman Corporation headquartered in Austin . ”
44291	44310	44311	44311	I	678	“ Wright Construction is purchasing the company to continue to grow and expand in and out of Texas . ”
44429	44432	44433	44433	Morgan	86	“ Jensen , ”
44439	44453	44454	44454	I	678	“ Um … yes . Right . More details regarding that will follow , ”
44469	44477	44460	44460	I	678	“ Now , more booze ! Enjoy ! ”
44499	44505	44506	44506	she	1077	“ More booze ? Enjoy ? ”
44511	44520	44506	44506	she	1077	“ What the hell is wrong with you ? ”
44521	44529	44506	44506	she	1077	“ Something else is on my mind . ”
44530	44566	44506	44506	she	1077	“ Jensen , you did n’t even tell them that we were n’t downsizing here . You did n’t tell them what the merger meant or that we ’d be getting new employees from Tarman . ”
44567	44576	44577	44577	I	678	“ Then , you tell them , Morgan , ”
44619	44622	44623	44623	Morgan	86	“ What ? ”
44628	44637	44623	44623	Morgan	86	“ You want me to address the crowd ? ”
44638	44660	44623	44623	Morgan	86	“ You ’re a Wright , are you not ? You know just as much about the merger as I do . ”
44661	44666	44667	44667	she	1077	“ But , Jensen … ”
44677	44684	44670	44670	I	678	“ I have faith in you . ”
44685	44693	44694	44694	she	1077	“ Wait , where are you going ? ”
44703	44709	44710	44710	I	678	“ To make another mistake , ”
44745	44749	44735	44736	Drew Barrymore	156	“ Just breathe , ”
45051	45054	45055	45055	I	678	“ Oh , ”
45063	45066	45067	45067	he	2210	“ Oh ? ”
45153	45158	45159	45159	I	678	“ It ’s you , ”
45166	45179	45180	45180	he	2210	“ You do realize that this is an office party , right ? ”
45200	45208	45209	45209	I	678	“ I might have heard that somewhere . ”
45232	45247	45225	45225	I	678	“ Last I checked , you did n’t work for me , Miss Robinson . ”
45248	45251	45252	45252	I	678	“ True , ”
45259	45268	45252	45252	I	678	“ Are you going to kick me out ? ”
45269	45286	45287	45287	I	678	“ I might let you stay … if you tell me what you ’re doing here . ”
45330	45349	45350	45350	He	2210	“ I came to listen to your inspirational speech . More booze , Mr. Wright . Very motivational . ”
45362	45379	45350	45350	He	2210	“ Thank you . Probably not my best speech , but I got a little distracted . ”
45380	45385	45386	45386	I	678	“ Oh , yeah ? ”
45390	45395	45386	45386	I	678	“ What distracted you ? ”
45396	45405	45350	45350	He	2210	“ A beautiful woman walked in the door . ”
45406	45409	45410	45410	I	678	“ Oh , ”
45416	45425	45410	45410	I	678	“ You must get distracted a lot then . ”
45441	45444	45426	45426	Jensen	2210	“ Never . ”
45572	45583	45584	45584	Jensen	2210	“ I think I should escort you out , Emery , ”
45593	45597	45598	45598	I	678	“ Right now ? ”
45603	45618	45598	45598	I	678	“ Yes . Would you like to see my office on the way out ? ”
45671	45677	45678	45678	Jensen	2210	“ I ’d love to . ”
45876	45883	45884	45884	he	2210	“ You ’ve been ignoring me , ”
45930	45940	45941	45941	I	678	“ You told me you made a horrible mistake , ”
45947	45950	45941	45941	I	678	“ Emery . ”
45988	45995	45996	45996	I	678	“ You have principles , Jensen , ”
46073	46077	46078	46078	he	2210	“ Fuck principles , ”
46092	46109	46110	46110	Jensen	2210	“ Why ? Why would you say that about the very principles that pushed me away ? ”
46181	46197	46198	46198	he	2210	“ Because I had the best night with you , the best sex with you , ”
46223	46275	46198	46198	he	2210	“ and I slept seven whole hours with you in my arms . I ’m an insomniac , and I can not tell you the last time I slept that long . I said those things because I like you , and I did n’t know how to react to that . ”
46276	46284	46198	46198	he	2210	“ So , you pushed me away ? ”
46285	46297	46298	46298	His	2210	“ I did , and I ’m not proud of it . ”
46307	46343	46304	46304	he	2210	“ But I ca n’t get you out of my head . You ’ve taken over my thoughts , my daydreams , my every last desire , and I have n’t slept since that night . ”
46344	46359	46360	46360	I	678	“ How do I know you ’re not going to change your mind again ? ”
46393	46411	46412	46412	I	678	“ You do n’t , but I ’m willing to see where this goes if you are . ”
46415	46418	46412	46412	I	678	“ Yes . ”
46419	46433	46434	46434	he	678	“ Good . One question , how much do you like this dress ? ”
46441	46449	46434	46434	he	678	“ It ’s a Christmas present actually . ”
46450	46459	46460	46460	he	678	“ God bless whoever gave it to you , ”
46466	46476	46460	46460	he	678	“ but I ’d like it on the floor . ”
46565	46570	46571	46571	he	678	“ That ’s better , ”
46657	46661	46662	46662	he	678	“ Oh no , ”
46665	46690	46662	46662	he	678	“ If you ’re going to wear designer shoes around me , then it ’d be a shame not to fuck you in them . ”
46906	46909	46910	46910	I	678	“ Please , ”
47537	47548	47549	47549	I	678	“ Do you have to go back to the party ? ”
47579	47587	47588	47588	he	2210	“ I seem to be otherwise occupied , ”
47629	47634	47635	47635	I	678	“ I like that , ”
47638	47652	47635	47635	I	678	“ I think I ’m going to have to take you out now . ”
47653	47658	47659	47659	I	678	“ Oh ? Tacos ? ”
47665	47680	47681	47681	he	2210	“ Probably something nicer than tacos after the week I ’ve put you through , ”
47684	47710	47711	47711	I	678	“ You do n’t have to do that . I do n’t need a fancy dinner as an apology . I liked our first date , ”
47716	47722	47723	47723	He	2210	“ It felt … real . ”
47733	47737	47739	47739	Emery	1077	“ It was . ”
47740	47743	47744	47744	Kimber	227	“ Emery ! ”
47747	47752	47753	47753	I	678	“ Just a second , ”
47824	47829	47830	47830	Kimber	227	“ Emery , now ! ”
47845	47855	47838	47838	I	678	“ What is it ? What ’s going on ? ”
47880	47885	47886	47886	I	678	“ Oh my God ! ”
47889	47900	47886	47886	I	678	“ Are you having contractions ? Are you in labor ? ”
47901	47903	47871	47871	She	227	“ I don’t”—she
47914	47924	47871	47871	She	227	herself—“know . It could just be Braxton Hicks contractions . ”
47925	47934	47935	47935	I	678	“ You ’re speaking another language to me , ”
47952	47970	47938	47938	I	678	“ I do n’t know what that means . What can I do ? Where ’s Lily ? ”
47971	47979	47980	47980	she	227	“ Nothing . Just — oh God ! ”
47987	48001	47980	47980	she	227	“ Just stay here a minute . Lily is playing in her room . ”
48002	48017	47938	47938	I	678	“ Okay . Should I check on her ? Should I just stand here ? ”
48018	48028	47980	47980	she	227	“ Em , really not the time . Just hold my”—she
48034	48036	47980	47980	she	227	hand—“hand . ”
48037	48045	47938	47938	I	678	“ Got it . Hand - holding . ”
48046	48081	47938	47938	I	678	“ Braxton Hicks contractions are prep for actual labor . They usually go away all on their own , but if they do n’t , then I ’ll have to go to the hospital . ”
48082	48088	48089	48089	I	678	“ Should I call Noah ? ”
48097	48115	48092	48092	She	227	“ You ’d better , just in case . I know he ’d want to be here . ”
48243	48259	48234	48234	He	70	“ Looks like things are progressing quickly . Better safe than sorry , my love . ”
48260	48265	48266	48266	Kimber	227	“ Get the bag , ”
48272	48287	48266	48266	Kimber	227	“ I hoped that she ’d wait until after Christmas . This is early . ”
48288	48309	48310	48310	I	678	“ She ’s as stubborn as her mother . Comes and goes whenever she wants without consulting anyone at all , ”
48320	48342	48313	48313	Kimber	227	“ Can you watch Lilyanne for us ? I hate to ask . I know that you have a date tonight . ”
48343	48378	48379	48379	Kimber	227	“ Of course I can watch Lily . Do n’t even think twice about it . Just make sure everything is all right with you and know that I have things under control here . ”
48384	48390	48379	48379	Kimber	227	“ You ’re a lifesaver . ”
48391	48399	48400	48400	I	678	“ Text me if you need me ! ”
48481	48486	48487	48487	he	2210	“ Hey , Emery , ”
48495	48505	48487	48487	he	2210	“ I was just about to leave my house . ”
48506	48509	48487	48487	he	2210	“ Actually … ”
48510	48518	48487	48487	he	2210	“ Oh no , are you canceling ? ”
48519	48524	48525	48525	I	678	“ Not on purpose , ”
48529	48568	48525	48525	I	678	“ My sister went into labor , or maybe pseudo labor , and they ’re heading to the hospital . I promised her I ’d watch my niece . So , I guess we ’ll have to cancel . ”
48569	48572	48573	48573	he	2210	“ Hmm , ”
48576	48588	48573	48573	he	2210	“ How about I come over there and help you babysit ? ”
48589	48601	48602	48602	I	678	“ You … what ? You want to help watch Lily ? ”
48607	48621	48602	48602	I	678	“ I ’d still like to see you , and I like kids . ”
48622	48632	48525	48525	I	678	“ But it ’s not our fancy dinner date … ”
48633	48666	48573	48573	he	2210	“ Yes . But I have n’t seen you in days , and I ’m not giving up the opportunity . Unless you do n’t want me to be around your niece ? ”
48667	48691	48525	48525	I	678	“ No , it ’s not that . I ’d love for you to come over . I bet Lilyanne would , too . ”
48692	48702	48703	48703	I	678	“ Great . Then , it ’s a date . ”
48773	48779	48780	48780	I	678	“ Hey , Lily Bug , ”
48783	48790	48780	48780	I	678	“ What are you up to ? ”
48791	48796	48797	48797	She	65	“ Playing with Barbies . ”
48812	48842	48797	48797	She	65	“ Well , I wanted to let you know that your mommy and daddy went to the doctor for a checkup , and I get to watch you tonight . ”
48843	48851	48852	48852	she	65	“ Is my new baby sister coming ? ”
48859	48886	48887	48887	Lily	65	“ Not yet . Just a checkup , but that means you get to hang out with Auntie Em tonight . You know what that means ? ”
48894	48903	48887	48887	Lily	65	“ Ice cream and sprinkles and Disney movies ! ”
48904	48911	48912	48912	I	678	“ That ’s right , missy ! ”
49080	49086	49087	49087	she	65	“ I ’ll get it ! ”
49090	49101	49087	49087	she	65	“ Mommy , Daddy , is my new sister here ? ”
49112	49129	49102	49102	I	678	“ You know it ’s not time yet . I have another surprise for you instead . ”
49179	49183	49184	49184	Lily	65	“ My boyfriend ! ”
49190	49220	49187	49187	Jensen	2210	“ Hey , Lilyanne . I heard you had a pretty awesome babysitter and thought I would drop by to hang out , too . How does that sound ? ”
49221	49229	49230	49230	Lilyanne	557	“ Yes ! Where are my flowers ? ”
49236	49241	49233	49233	I	678	“ Oh , boy ! ”
49242	49252	49253	49253	Jensen	2210	“ Guess I should have seen that one coming , ”
49339	49354	49355	49355	Jensen	2210	“ I think I need my own ice cream before we start the movie , ”
49359	49364	49365	49365	Lilyanne	557	“ I can help ! ”
49368	49375	49365	49365	Lilyanne	557	“ I ’m great with sprinkles . ”
49376	49382	49383	49383	He	2210	“ I bet you are . ”
49475	49480	49481	49481	he	2210	“ I missed you , ”
49495	49511	49484	49484	He	2210	“ I missed you , too . Are you sure you do n’t mind this ? ”
49512	49520	49521	49521	I	678	“ Do I look like I mind ? ”
49531	49546	49547	49547	he	2210	“ Who could pass up a big bowl of ice cream and Disney movies ? ”
49550	49558	49547	49547	he	2210	“ I ’m certain , no one . ”
49559	49563	49564	49564	Lilyanne	557	“ Found it ! ”
49567	49572	49573	49573	I	678	“ Let me guess , ”
49576	49584	49573	49573	I	678	“ No ! It ’s a surprise . ”
49585	49593	49594	49594	I	678	“ Okay . I wo n’t look , ”
49691	49695	49699	49699	Jensen	2210	“ Let It Go ”
49882	49899	49870	49870	We	1018	“ All right . Everything is okay with Kimber . They ’re leaving the hospital soon . ”
49900	49914	49915	49915	Jensen	2210	“ Good . I ’m glad that the baby did n’t come early , ”
49918	49930	49915	49915	Jensen	2210	“ Want me to take this one up to her room ? ”
49931	49937	49938	49938	Jensen	2210	“ You do n’t mind ? ”
50037	50045	50029	50029	Tangled	162	“ You ’re really great with her , ”
50050	50055	50029	50029	Tangled	162	“ I like kids . ”
50056	50077	50029	50029	Tangled	162	“ I like kids who are raised right . Lilyanne is an angel compared to some other kids her age . ”
50078	50083	50084	50084	he	2210	“ That is true , ”
50098	50143	50144	50144	I	678	“ She ’s full of possibilities . I love that about her . She has so much joy and is full of life . I think she reminds us all that we need to live a little more . Be a bit more carefree . ”
50147	50153	50154	50154	I	678	“ That ’s definitely Lily . ”
50185	50198	50154	50154	I	678	“ It ’s part of the reason I left my PhD program . ”
50199	50212	50154	50154	I	678	“ What do you mean ? You did n’t feel carefree anymore ? ”
50213	50279	50154	50154	I	678	“ I did n’t have any joy . I just wish I ’d figured it out sooner . I wish I had n’t needed to be hit over the head to know the program was n’t right . I mean … I’d already completed my comprehensive exams . All I had to do was finish my dissertation and defend it to my committee to pass . ”
50280	50291	50292	50292	he	1022	“ How could you quit if you were so close ? ”
50306	50367	50296	50296	I	678	“ I really did n’t love it . I think I was doing it because one thread kept pulling me back to it . The stress got out of control . I could n’t handle it , and I had to get on anxiety medication . Plus , well , I found out my advisor was sleeping with an undergrad . ”
50368	50371	50372	50372	he	1022	“ Jesus , ”
50375	50385	50372	50372	he	1022	“ What a prick ! Did he get fired ? ”
50386	50405	50406	50406	I	678	“ I did n’t turn him in . I just broke up with him and quit the department . ”
50425	50432	50433	50433	he	1022	“ You were dating your professor ? ”
50436	50449	50450	50450	I	678	“ Yeah , for almost three years . Welcome to my life , ”
50457	50471	50472	50472	he	1022	“ How long ago did you find out about him cheating on you ? ”
50566	50575	50576	50576	I	678	“ I do n’t know . Two weeks ? ”
50580	50607	50608	50608	He	1022	“ Fuck . I ’m sorry about that . And only two weeks ago ? No wonder you did n’t want to go on a date . ”
50621	50629	50608	50608	He	1022	“ Is all of this too soon ? ”
50630	50633	50634	50634	I	678	“ No , ”
50669	50696	50657	50657	I	678	“ It had been over with Mitch long before I ended it . I just had n’t had the nerve to realize what I really wanted . ”
50697	50705	50706	50706	he	1022	“ And what do you really want ? ”
50721	50729	50657	50657	I	678	“ Something I ’m really passionate about . ”
50730	50736	50657	50657	I	678	“ And what is that ? ”
50737	50754	50657	50657	I	678	“ I ’m really not sure . I think I ’d just like time to decide . ”
50755	50765	50766	50766	He	1022	“ You have all the time in the world . ”
50814	50822	50823	50823	he	1022	“ What are you doing next week ? ”
50829	50836	50823	50823	he	1022	“ Seeing you , I hope . ”
50837	50862	50863	50863	I	678	“ I have to be in Austin for a few days to sign some paperwork . How would you like to show me around ? ”
50877	50890	50863	50863	I	678	“ Really ? But it ’s only a few days before Christmas . ”
50891	50895	50896	50896	he	1022	“ Business calls , ”
50900	50915	50896	50896	he	1022	“ But I ’d love to have you with me if you could come . ”
50916	50974	50975	50975	Jensen	2210	“ I ’ll have to check my schedule at the Buddy Holly Center , but I should be able to do it . Plus , it might be pretty awesome if we drove out there because I need to get the rest of my stuff from my apartment before someone comes to sublet the place in January . ”
50981	50999	51000	51000	His	2210	“ We can definitely stop to get your things while we ’re there , but , Emery … ”
51022	51025	51008	51008	I	678	“ Hmm ? ”
51026	51034	51035	51036	Nineteen Emery	1077	“ We ’re not driving , love . ”
51120	51131	51132	51133	a man	210	“ Allow me to get your bags , Ms. Robinson , ”
51149	51156	51136	51136	He	210	“ Oh , um … okay , ”
51164	51170	51171	51171	Jensen	2210	“ Thank you , Robbie , ”
51188	51202	51174	51174	He	210	“ Why do you seem so surprised ? You knew we were flying . ”
51203	51210	51211	51211	I	678	“ Sure . Just … crazy . ”
51236	51248	51217	51217	my	678	“ Is this how you try to impress all the girls ? ”
51249	51252	51253	51253	He	210	“ No . ”
51275	51279	51266	51266	he	210	“ Just you . ”
51453	51459	51440	51440	Jensen	2210	“ What is so funny ? ”
51460	51463	51447	51447	his	2210	“ Nothing . ”
51464	51469	51470	51470	he	2210	“ Are you sure ? ”
51477	51492	51493	51493	I	678	“ I just suspect that you have a hidden Jacuzzi or something back there , ”
51507	51517	51499	51499	He	2210	“ Not quite . It ’s used for business . ”
51518	51523	51524	51524	He	2210	“ Much more boring . ”
51566	51569	51559	51559	I	678	“ Cheers . ”
51570	51577	51578	51578	Jensen	2210	“ It ’s five o’clock somewhere , ”
51610	51623	51624	51624	I	678	“ So , what ’s the big plan for your paperwork thing ? ”
51627	51656	51624	51624	I	678	“ I officially sign the paperback for the Tarman Corporation merger this afternoon . So , we ’ll have the morning to ourselves today and all day tomorrow . ”
51657	51679	51624	51624	I	678	“ Oh , good . I like that . Is there anything you want to see while we are in town ? ”
51680	51698	51624	51624	I	678	“ Whatever you want to show me . You ’re the one who lived there after all . ”
51699	51710	51624	51624	I	678	“ True . I have a few things in mind . ”
51711	51718	51719	51719	he	2210	“ Good . Me , too , ”
51906	51910	51911	51911	he	2210	“ Apartment first ? ”
51924	51929	51911	51911	he	2210	“ I suppose so . ”
52101	52112	52113	52113	I	678	“ Um … maybe you should wait in the car , ”
52123	52128	52113	52113	I	678	“ What ? Why ? ”
52129	52152	52153	52153	Jensen	2210	“ Well , because it ’s a hot mess . And I need a few minutes … or hours to tidy up . ”
52158	52193	52153	52153	Jensen	2210	“ We ’re not wasting hours here . Why do n’t we just get the things you need ? Then , I can have a cleaning crew come through and box everything else up . ”
52194	52209	52113	52113	I	678	“ No way ! I ca n’t let you pay to clean my apartment ! ”
52210	52219	52220	52220	he	2210	“ Fine . Then , let me inside , ”
52243	52254	52228	52228	I	678	“ All right . Well , do n’t judge me . ”
52255	52275	52276	52276	I	678	“ I ’ll judge you for the incredible woman that you are , Emery . Not for anything else . ”
52286	52292	52293	52293	He	2210	“ You ’ve been warned . ”
52300	52306	52293	52293	He	2210	“ I spoke too soon . ”
52314	52317	52293	52293	He	2210	“ Jerk . ”
52318	52335	52336	52336	We	1048	“ I ’m kidding . I ’m kidding . Come on , let ’s get started . ”
52602	52606	52607	52607	I	678	“ Coffee first ? ”
52610	52613	52607	52607	I	678	“ Definitely . ”
52798	52803	52804	52804	Jensen	2210	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
52817	52827	52807	52807	He	2210	“ Hey , tell me what ’s going on . ”
52828	52831	52832	52832	Mitch	54	“ Emery , ”
52954	52962	52940	52940	He	2210	“ Let ’s just go somewhere else . ”
52963	52968	52969	52969	I	678	“ It ’s okay , ”
52984	52992	52976	52976	I	678	“ This is my favorite coffee shop . ”
52993	52998	52999	52999	he	54	“ Are you sure ? ”
53027	53042	53043	53043	Mitch	54	“ I ’m so glad you ’re back . I knew you would be , ”
53123	53132	53118	53118	He	54	“ Do n’t lay a hand on her , ”
53204	53215	53216	53216	Mitch	54	“ Always nice to meet a friend of Emery ’s , ”
53227	53238	53216	53216	Mitch	54	“ I ’m her dissertation adviser , Dr. Mitch Campbell . ”
53264	53271	53257	53257	Jensen	2210	“ I know who you are . ”
53272	53281	53282	53282	I	678	“ And you ’re not my dissertation adviser , ”
53286	53292	53282	53282	I	678	“ I quit the program . ”
53313	53352	53353	53353	My	678	“ You were just upset that day . I told the department to dismiss the withdrawal paperwork , and I had you reinstated . I knew you ’d want to finish up . You only have another year . ”
53368	53373	53353	53353	My	678	“ You did what ? ”
53374	53395	53396	53396	Mitch	54	“ The department seemed confused that you would up and leave out of nowhere . As was I , Emery , ”
53399	53443	53396	53396	Mitch	54	“ I do n’t know what you think happened or what you think you were doing by leaving , but it ’s over now . You do n’t have to be so irrational about it all . I ’ve fixed it for you . ”
53444	53450	53451	53451	I	678	“ What I think happened ? ”
53454	53457	53458	53458	Jensen	2210	“ Gaslighting , ”
53464	53467	53458	53458	Jensen	2210	“ Priceless . ”
53468	53480	53481	53481	I	678	“ I do n’t even have time to listen to this , ”
53489	53528	53481	53481	I	678	“ I know what happened . I know what you did to me . And I am leaving the program . I can not believe you went behind my back to toss out the paperwork I ’d filed . ”
53529	53532	53533	53533	he	2210	“ Emery , ”
53541	53544	53533	53533	he	2210	“ Stop . ”
53545	53550	53551	53551	Jensen	2210	“ You heard her , ”
53560	53607	53554	53554	He	2210	“ The last thing you want to do right now is make a scene . The last thing you want is for me to take this up with the president or the provost . I happen to be on a first - name basis with both . ”
53608	53614	53615	53615	Mitch	54	“ Are you threatening me ? ”
53618	53632	53615	53615	Mitch	54	“ Depends on whether or not you walk out of here right now . ”
53633	53641	53554	53554	He	2210	“ Who is this guy , Emery ? ”
53642	53647	53648	53648	I	678	“ He ’s my … ”
53659	53662	53663	53663	Jensen	2210	“ Boyfriend , ”
53752	53755	53756	53756	Mitch	54	“ Boyfriend , ”
53778	53785	53771	53771	I	678	“ Well , that was fast . ”
53786	53791	53792	53792	I	678	“ Not fast enough , ”
53795	53802	53803	53803	Mitch	54	“ Why am I not surprised ? ”
53814	53825	53803	53803	Mitch	54	“ You always did like to be a kept woman . ”
53858	53861	53856	53856	Ass	168	“ Emery … ”
53862	53870	53871	53871	I	678	“ Let ’s just get some coffee , ”
53899	53910	53911	53911	he	54	“ I did n’t mean to spring that on you , ”
53932	53970	53926	53926	he	54	“ I meant for the whole thing to be romantic . To take you out to dinner and ask you over candlelight if you ’d be my girlfriend . Then , it just kind of slipped out . ”
53971	53974	53975	53975	I	678	“ Oh , ”
53979	53982	53975	53975	I	678	“ Wow . ”
53983	54007	54008	54008	He	54	“ I know it ’s fast and that I have a lot to tell you , but I want you to be mine . ”
54023	54052	54053	54053	I	678	“ I ca n’t get you out of my head , and I do n’t want you out . So , do you want to be my girlfriend ? ”
54077	54080	54081	54081	Jensen	2210	“ What ? ”
54096	54109	54110	54110	He	2210	“ You really are n’t like any other guy , are you ? ”
54117	54145	54110	54110	He	2210	“ Most guys are too busy trying to keep girls dangling on the line , but you just come right out and say you want a relationship . ”
54146	54178	54110	54110	He	2210	“ I ’m a businessman . I say what I want , I negotiate for it , and then I take it . I do n’t want to lead you on . ”
54179	54184	54185	54185	He	2210	“ I like that . ”
54188	54200	54185	54185	He	2210	“ And I like that you said you were my boyfriend . ”
54201	54204	54205	54205	he	2210	“ Good , ”
54215	54223	54205	54205	he	2210	“ Does that make you my girlfriend ? ”
54224	54230	54185	54185	He	2210	“ I guess it does . ”
54560	54566	54549	54550	hurried receptionists	1086	“ Hello , Mr. Wright . ”
54631	54636	54637	54637	I	678	“ Gentlemen , lady , ”
54654	54659	54644	54645	Abigail Tarman	169	“ let ’s begin . ”
54749	54752	54753	54753	I	678	“ Marc , ”
54767	54770	54771	54771	he	108	“ Jensen , ”
54790	54794	54795	54795	Marc	1377	“ Shall we ? ”
54811	54817	54795	54795	Marc	1377	“ I believe we shall . ”
54959	54966	54967	54967	I	678	“ Good doing business with you , ”
54973	54984	54985	54985	Marc	1377	“ I wish I could say the same to you , ”
54992	54999	55004	55004	Abigail	169	“ Now , now , Marcus , ”
55008	55020	55004	55004	Abigail	169	“ Would you care to join us for dinner , Jensen ? ”
55021	55033	55000	55002	his younger sister	1098	“ I have to decline . But thank you , Abby . ”
55034	55058	55059	55059	My	678	“ Jensen , come on . I insist . We ’ve known each other too long for it to all end this way . ”
55066	55075	55076	55076	Marc	1377	“ I have my … girlfriend with me . ”
55090	55099	55076	55076	Marc	1377	“ Girlfriend ? That ’s a new one . ”
55100	55103	55104	55104	Abigail	169	“ Marcus , ”
55107	55125	55104	55104	Abigail	169	“ Your girlfriend is welcome to come , Jensen . I ca n’t wait to meet her . ”
55126	55142	55076	55076	Marc	1377	“ All right . Let me let her know . She ’s at the hotel . ”
55143	55155	55156	55156	Abigail	169	“ Why do n’t we pick her up on the way ? ”
55423	55432	55433	55433	she	169	“ Who is the new girl , Jensen ? ”
55436	55457	55458	55458	Abigail	169	“ She ’s recently moved to town . Was a PhD student here at UT before coming back to Lubbock . ”
55472	55488	55489	55489	I	678	“ An in - town girl ? Why , you never fail to surprise me . ”
55492	55498	55489	55489	I	678	“ She ’s worth it . ”
55499	55505	55506	55506	My	678	“ And does she know ? ”
55543	55548	55549	55549	Abigail	169	“ She does n’t , ”
55557	55565	55549	55549	Abigail	169	“ God help you with Marc here . ”
55734	55738	55739	55739	she	169	“ A limo ? ”
55742	55747	55739	55739	she	169	“ A bit much ? ”
55748	55753	55754	55754	she	169	“ Or just enough , ”
55757	55773	55754	55754	she	169	“ You seem like you ’re in a better mood than when I left you . ”
55774	55794	55795	55795	I	678	“ Well , I got all that nasty business resolved , and now , I ’m with you again . ”
55840	55846	55847	55847	Abigail	169	“ Come on , Jensen , ”
55853	55859	55847	55847	Abigail	169	“ We have to talk , ”
55884	55898	55876	55876	Her	169	“ I just have to … tell you some things . Ignore Marc . ”
55899	55905	55867	55867	she	169	“ I do n’t understand . ”
55906	55918	55919	55919	Emery	1077	“ I know . I ’m sorry . I ’ll explain . ”
55981	55984	55985	55985	Marc	1377	“ Ah , ”
55994	56002	56003	56003	Emery	1077	“ you do n’t seem the type . ”
56008	56014	56003	56003	Emery	1077	“ What does that mean ? ”
56015	56018	56019	56019	Abigail	169	“ Nothing , ”
56022	56034	56019	56019	Abigail	169	“ Ignore my brother . He ’s in a foul mood . ”
56080	56095	56096	56096	Marc	1377	“ I just mean that you ’re the girl of the weekend , right ? ”
56120	56123	56124	56124	Abigail	169	“ Marc ! ”
56127	56135	56136	56136	I	678	“ Just let it be , Marc , ”
56139	56146	56147	56147	Emery	1077	“ What exactly does that mean ? ”
56158	56181	56150	56150	He	1377	“ You know … the fling he has when he ’s out of town . You must realize that you ’re it . ”
56182	56189	56190	56190	she	1077	“ I ’ll have you know , ”
56193	56246	56190	56190	she	1077	“ I know all about his reputation , and I do n’t appreciate your insinuation that I ’m that kind of girl . Jensen and I are together . This is n’t a one - time thing . And who the hell are you to even say something like that to me ? ”
56260	56267	56268	56268	Marc	1377	“ Just an old family friend , ”
56271	56301	56302	56302	Emery	1077	“ Tell me everything about yourself . How did you manage to catch Jensen ’s eye and keep it ? I thought only one person was capable of that . ”
56344	56348	56349	56349	she	1077	“ Blow jobs , ”
56361	56366	56354	56354	Marc	1377	“ You surprise me . ”
56388	56396	56397	56397	Emery	1077	“ Also , I ’m completely irresistible , ”
56400	56406	56407	56407	Marc	1377	“ I have no doubt , ”
56424	56430	56410	56410	His	1377	“ No doubt at all . ”
56524	56532	56533	56533	she	1077	“ What the hell is going on ? ”
56547	56551	56536	56536	I	678	“ A lot . ”
56552	56574	56536	56536	I	678	“ I can see that , Jensen . Who are these people ? Why did you tell me to ignore Marc ? ”
56575	56608	56536	56536	I	678	“ Marc is an old family friend . Sort of . He and Abigail are Tarmans , who , up until a few minutes ago , were the Wrights ’ biggest rivals . ”
56609	56617	56536	56536	I	678	“ You were friends with your rivals ? ”
56618	56624	56536	56536	I	678	“ Money talks to money , ”
56628	56631	56632	56632	she	1127	“ Okay , ”
56636	56644	56632	56632	she	1127	“ But all of that other stuff ? ”
56645	56651	56632	56632	she	1127	“ I have a reputation . ”
56652	56658	56659	56659	I	678	“ I know that much . ”
56708	56735	56700	56700	I	678	“ But I ’m not doing that anymore . That ’s why I brought you . That ’s why I asked you to be my girlfriend . ”
56736	56748	56749	56749	she	1127	“ So … you would n’t be tempted to shop around ? ”
56757	56771	56772	56772	I	678	“ God , I ’m sorry . I should n’t have asked that . ”
56778	56792	56793	56793	I	678	“ It ’s a fair question , considering my background , but no , ”
56799	56816	56793	56793	I	678	“ I would never do that . I am a one - woman kind of man . ”
56817	56830	56793	56793	I	678	“ One woman being me … or that other girl Marc mentioned ? ”
56831	56846	56793	56793	I	678	“ The woman he was talking about is my ex - wife , Vanessa . ”
56847	56857	56858	56858	she	1127	“ Okay . So , you ’ve been married , ”
56861	56871	56793	56793	I	678	“ I do n’t follow the Wright family drama . ”
56872	56877	56878	56878	I	678	“ Any of it ? ”
56884	56907	56878	56878	I	678	“ Nope . Kind of swore off the whole bunch . Are you still in love with her ? Is that it ? ”
56908	56930	56878	56878	I	678	“ No . Vanessa is not the woman for me . If she were , I never would have divorced her . ”
56931	56934	56935	56935	I	678	“ Okay . ”
57008	57029	57000	57000	I	678	“ Emery , I want you and only you . I would never cheat on you . Never , ever . ”
57030	57037	57038	57038	I	678	“ How could you know that ? ”
57083	57097	57065	57065	she	1127	“ Because Vanessa cheated on me , and I divorced her for it . ”
57117	57121	57108	57108	Emery	1077	“ Oh God . ”
57122	57140	57108	57108	Emery	1077	“ It was nasty , and I ’d never put another human being through something like that . ”
57141	57146	57108	57108	Emery	1077	“ It feels insurmountable . ”
57147	57151	57152	57152	I	678	“ It was , ”
57155	57211	57152	57152	I	678	“ And I ’m not perfect by any means , Emery . I have trust issues . After what Vanessa did , I never thought that I would be open to another person again , but you ’re different . I want to open up to you . It ’s all going to take time . ”
57212	57215	57216	57216	she	1127	“ No , ”
57223	57248	57216	57216	she	1127	“ I was just cheated on . I ’m the one with major trust issues . I just freaked out , and then Marc — ”
57249	57255	57152	57152	I	678	“ Marc is a jackass . ”
57256	57261	57152	57152	I	678	“ I ’ve realized . ”
57262	57330	57331	57331	She	1129	“ Look , I do n’t want you to doubt me . This is the reason I reacted the way I did the first night we were together . I have enough baggage as it is . Though I may not be a hundred percent since the divorce , I know that I ’m better when I ’m with you . You make me a better man . ”
57527	57532	57533	57533	I	678	“ Sorry about that , ”
57541	57545	57546	57546	Marc	1377	“ Of course , ”
57560	57582	57583	57583	His	1377	“ I took the liberty of ordering you a vodka tonic . You do like vodka tonics , do n’t you ? ”
57608	57618	57619	57619	I	678	“ I ’m more of a champagne drinker myself . ”
57622	57632	57619	57619	I	678	“ Or tequila shots . Whatever you ’re into . ”
57633	57647	57648	57648	Marc	1377	“ No vodka tonic ? I ’m shocked . A girl like you ? ”
57655	57673	57648	57648	Marc	1377	“ Soon , you ’re going to tell me you ’ve never modeled with that pretty face . ”
57674	57677	57678	57678	Abigail	169	“ Marc , ”
57693	57788	57687	57687	I	678	“ Look , it ’s fine . Whatever you ’re doing is fine . Take shots at me all you want . I get you might be upset with Jensen , and you ’re petty enough to try to take it out on me , but I ’m not a vodka tonic – drinking , pretty - faced model . I ’m not anything you think I am . So , keep hurling insults and layered jabs . I can take it . It ’s not going to make a damn difference to me . ”
57857	57875	57851	57851	I	678	“ Can you replace that vodka tonic order with a glass of champagne ? Veuve Brut preferably . ”
57876	57880	57881	57881	My	678	“ Of course . ”
58134	58159	58160	58160	I	678	“ Glad I grabbed this dress from my place before we left or else I would have had to miss that really fun time , ”
58190	58207	58182	58182	He	2210	“ I ’m sorry about that . I should have realized it would be a mistake . ”
58208	58212	58213	58213	I	678	“ A mistake , ”
58234	58248	58217	58217	He	2210	“ Are you going to tell me what crawled up Marc ’s butt ? ”
58259	58270	58271	58271	I	678	“ Besides the fact that I just bought his company ? ”
58278	58290	58291	58291	He	2210	“ It was more than that . I ’m not blind . ”
58297	58315	58291	58291	He	2210	“ You ’re right . It ’s a long story . You already know part of it . ”
58316	58322	58323	58323	I	678	“ We have all night , ”
58327	58332	58333	58333	he	2210	“ Indeed we do , ”
58349	58366	58333	58333	he	2210	“ Tell me about it . I want to know you . I want to understand . ”
58367	58371	58372	58372	He	2210	“ All right . ”
58409	58459	58401	58401	Jensen	2210	“ Marc and I have known each other a long time . We were always thinly veiled enemies but hopeful friends . Against his father ’s wishes , he ended up at Texas Tech because of their architecture program . We were in the program at the same time . ”
58460	58468	58469	58469	I	678	“ You went to school for architecture ? ”
58474	58482	58469	58469	I	678	“ I thought you majored in business . ”
58483	58552	58401	58401	Jensen	2210	“ Yes . My father required I major in business , but I took architecture classes on the side . I believed , as did Marc , that business destroyed the soul , as we had seen it happen with our families . It did n’t build anything . It only tore things down . It never made things better . We were visionaries . We wanted more . ”
58553	58564	58565	58565	I	678	“ Yet you each run your respective father ’s business , ”
58568	58635	58636	58636	His	678	“ I knew I would always have a job at Wright Construction whenever I wanted it . So , post - graduation , I took an internship at an architectural company in New York for a year . Vanessa and I were engaged . My father was furious about the internship , but I had a whole plan . I was going to change the world . ”
58660	58772	58649	58649	He	678	“ Anyway , long story short , my father died . Left with nothing but his disappointment , I took over the company and moved back to Lubbock . There was n’t another option since Austin was still in college . Landon , as you know , was about to graduate high school . The board needed someone they could trust . They got me . Vanessa stayed in New York . She was … modeling part - time , and things were looking up . We got married that summer . She started modeling full - time , and Marc got my full - time job at the architectural company . ”
58794	58832	58778	58778	I	678	“ Wright did as much business in New York as I wanted . I could have flown there every weekend to see Vanessa , but I did n’t . I was engrossed in work and still grieving . ”
58833	58842	58843	58843	I	678	“ But it was n’t enough for Vanessa , ”
58852	58867	58846	58846	His	1149	“ Never could have been . Then she ended up in Marc ’s bed . ”
58882	58889	58846	58846	His	1149	“ That ’s not your fault . ”
58890	58973	58846	58846	His	1149	“ No , it ’s not . It took many years of therapy to realize that it was entirely her fault . She was the one who found solace with Marc . She was the one who could have stopped the whole thing , but she had n’t . She ’d wanted the visionary she had fallen in love with … but I was n’t that man anymore . So , she ’d settled for Marc in the meantime . Second best . ”
58974	58982	58983	58983	Jensen	2210	“ Everyone is second best to you . ”
58994	58997	58983	58983	Jensen	2210	“ Thanks . ”
58998	59015	58846	58846	His	1149	“ So … why is Marc so bitter when he was the one who did wrong ? ”
59016	59025	58846	58846	His	1149	“ To him , I ruined his life . ”
59026	59031	58983	58983	Jensen	2210	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
59032	59137	58846	58846	His	1149	“ It is . I understand it from his perspective though . He was always in love or obsessed with Vanessa . Whatever the case was , he finally had her , and then she left him again for me . I got the girl . He ended up having to take over his father ’s company . And , now , I ’ve taken that , too . He ’s bitter . But I do n’t , no , I ca n’t sympathize with him . He might find it convenient to blame me , but he ’s the bastard who did this . ”
59138	59168	58846	58846	His	1149	“ And you should n’t sympathize with him . I did n’t , and I did n’t even know the circumstances . I ’m glad I snapped at him . ”
59169	59176	59177	59177	Jensen	2210	“ God , you ’re amazing , ”
59180	59191	59192	59192	His	2210	“ The way you handled dinner , it was brilliant . ”
59274	59279	59280	59280	I	678	“ You think so ? ”
59283	59289	59280	59280	I	678	“ Know so , love . ”
59716	59723	59724	59724	I	678	“ I can feel my heartbeat , ”
59727	59731	59724	59724	I	678	“ Feel it . ”
59744	59749	59750	59750	he	2210	“ You ’re welcome , ”
59764	59771	59754	59754	I	678	“ Now , he has manners . ”
59772	59780	59750	59750	he	2210	“ Did n’t seem like you minded . ”
59781	59786	59754	59754	I	678	“ Not one bit . ”
59787	59801	59802	59802	he	2210	“ Good . Then , maybe you ’ll be up for round two ? ”
59809	59813	59814	59814	I	678	“ Oh God , ”
59820	59826	59814	59814	I	678	“ Let me recover first . ”
59852	59862	59843	59843	He	2210	“ How about we use that Jacuzzi for recovery ? ”
59875	59894	59843	59843	He	2210	“ Why do I have a feeling that you ’ll make that sexual , too , Mr. Wright ? ”
59895	59905	59906	59906	He	2210	“ Everything about you is sexual , Miss Robinson . ”
59916	59933	59906	59906	He	2210	“ And I intend to take full advantage of you being naked in my hotel room . ”
59944	59958	59959	59959	His	2210	“ Guess I ’ll turn the jets on and get started myself then . ”
60390	60400	60374	60374	He	2210	“ God , I ’m going to miss you , ”
60404	60413	60401	60401	I	678	“ Do n’t miss me . Stay here . ”
60419	60426	60414	60414	I	678	“ I ca n’t stay here . ”
60427	60444	60401	60401	I	678	“ Stay here every night you like . I sleep better when I ’m with you . ”
60445	60454	60455	60455	I	678	“ We have not been sleeping at night , ”
60458	60461	60462	60462	He	2210	“ Exactly . ”
60518	60521	60525	60525	Jensen	2210	“ Landon … ”
60526	60534	60535	60535	Landon	278	“ What the fuck is going on ? ”
60544	60547	60554	60554	she	1077	“ Landon , man”—I
60564	60567	60554	60554	she	1077	shocked—“you’re back . ”
60633	60651	60629	60629	he	278	“ Cut the shit , Jensen . Just answer the question . What is happening right here ? ”
60689	60696	60673	60673	Landon	278	“ I meant to tell you — ”
60697	60702	60703	60703	His	278	“ Tell me what ? ”
60730	60737	60742	60742	Emery	1077	“ Are you two … together ? ”
60738	60741	60742	60742	Emery	1077	“ Yes , ”
60749	60754	60742	60742	Emery	1077	“ we ’re together . ”
60767	60799	60800	60800	He	278	“ I was only gone a couple of weeks . I do n’t understand how this could have happened … and why I was never informed that this was fucking happening . ”
60811	60816	60800	60800	He	278	“ Where ’s Miranda ? ”
60830	60838	60800	60800	He	278	“ Did she come in with you ? ”
60839	60871	60872	60872	he	278	“ Are you kidding me ? After the fit she had when she found out that Emery was still here , you think she ’d have let me fly back alone ? ”
60876	60883	60884	60884	I	678	“ So … she ’s here ? ”
60910	60926	60927	60927	Landon	278	“ She ’s out shopping . Fuck , could you imagine if she was here ? ”
60941	60970	60927	60927	Landon	278	“ Could you fucking imagine ? I came back at your request , and you did n’t even tell me about Emery ? Is this what you wanted ? ”
60971	60974	60975	60975	I	678	“ No , ”
61035	61063	61030	61030	I	678	“ I wanted to tell you in advance about Emery so we could talk about this like men and not just get pissed off at each other . ”
61076	61084	61085	61085	Emery	1077	“ You know , I should go , ”
61097	61105	61088	61088	She	1077	“ It ’s been a long weekend . ”
61174	61179	61180	61180	I	678	“ Are you sure ? ”
61183	61201	61180	61180	I	678	“ Yeah . Um … I should go see my sister . Check in , you know . ”
61202	61212	61219	61219	She	1077	“ All right . I ’ll call you later . ”
61213	61218	61219	61219	She	1077	“ Yeah , sure . ”
61255	61267	61268	61268	Landon	278	“ So , you ’re fucking my ex - girlfriend now ? ”
61298	61305	61294	61294	Dad	85	“ It ’s not like that . ”
61306	61343	61344	61344	I	678	“ What is it like exactly ? Gave up on messing around with every girl you came across when you were out of town and decided to dick around with all those in town , too ? ”
61374	61384	61385	61385	I	678	“ I do n’t want to fight with you , ”
61389	61430	61385	61385	I	678	“ Well , you do n’t get to make that choice , Jensen . You walked in here with Emery Robinson . We ’d dated for two years . You knew her when we were in high school , Jensen . ”
61431	61452	61385	61385	I	678	“ I did n’t know her then , and like you , I did n’t even recognize her at first . ”
61453	61457	61385	61385	I	678	“ Like me ? ”
61458	61463	61464	61464	I	678	“ At the wedding , ”
61483	61507	61474	61474	he	278	“ You met her at Sutton ’s wedding ? You ’ve known who she is this whole time and did n’t say anything ? ”
61508	61545	61385	61385	I	678	“ Yes , all right ? Yes . I ’ve known who she was since that next morning . You were the one who told me that she was leaving town after a couple of days . ”
61546	61558	61474	61474	he	278	“ That was n’t an invitation to go and fuck her ! ”
61559	61568	61569	61569	I	678	“ I did n’t take it as one ! ”
61573	61602	61569	61569	I	678	“ I was going to leave her alone , but then we kept running into each other . I ’ve fallen for her , Landon . I have . ”
61603	61607	61608	61608	Landon	278	“ For now , ”
61614	61647	61608	61608	Landon	278	“ What happens when you ’re tired of her ? We all know you bore easily . You can fool her with whatever you ’re doing , but I know your reputation . ”
61648	61662	61663	61663	I	678	“ Emery does not compare to any other girl I ’ve been with , ”
61666	61680	61663	61663	I	678	“ Comparing Emery to any of my flings is an insult to her . ”
61681	61691	61663	61663	I	678	“ Or is it just an insult to you ? ”
61726	61733	61720	61720	I	678	“ I should have told you . ”
61734	61740	61706	61708	his horrible wife	1175	“ You said that already . ”
61741	61774	61720	61720	I	678	“ I was planning to tell you before Christmas . But I wanted to make sure this was a real thing . I did n’t want you to find out this way . ”
61775	61836	61837	61837	Landon	278	“ Whatever , Jensen . Just admit it . It ’s not that you did n’t want me to find out this way . It ’s that you did n’t want me to find out at all . Everyone else in the family can fuck up , and you solve their problems , but you ca n’t solve your own . ”
61846	61852	61837	61837	Landon	278	“ You just hide them . ”
61853	61897	61898	61898	I	678	“ That ’s not what I was going to do . I care for Emery . I wanted to make things right . This is n’t a joke to me . And why are you so pissed off anyway ? You ’re married . ”
61902	61920	61898	61898	I	678	“ By the way you ’re acting , I ’d think you still had feelings for Emery . ”
61921	61927	61928	61928	Landon	278	“ Fuck off , Jensen , ”
61957	61982	61983	61983	He	278	“ The breakup was ten years ago , Landon . This is all harsh for someone you ’ve barely spoken to since high school . ”
61991	61998	61983	61983	He	278	“ You do n’t know anything . ”
62009	62032	61999	61999	I	678	“ You went to different colleges . You were going different directions . A lot of couples break up for those reasons . ”
62033	62049	62050	62050	I	678	“ If you believe that is what happened , then you do n’t know Emery . ”
62105	62115	62116	62116	Landon	278	“ And you ’re smarter than this , Jensen , ”
62119	62134	62116	62116	Landon	278	“ You know that you do n’t want to bring her into your mess . ”
62135	62140	62116	62116	Landon	278	“ She already knows . ”
62141	62144	62145	62145	Landon	278	“ Everything ? ”
62148	62152	62153	62153	I	678	“ Not everything , ”
62157	62176	62153	62153	I	678	“ It ’s only been a couple weeks . I ’m trying to ease her into my life . ”
62177	62188	62116	62116	Landon	278	“ You better tell her , Jensen or I will . ”
62189	62197	62153	62153	I	678	“ Do n’t threaten me , Landon . ”
62198	62213	62214	62214	he	278	“ Fuck ! You know I wo n’t tell her . Though I should , ”
62220	62239	62214	62214	he	278	“ Emery is a good , kind , and genuine person . She ’s too good for you . ”
62318	62322	62323	62323	I	678	“ Heidi here ? ”
62326	62330	62323	62323	I	678	“ Pool table . ”
62331	62339	62340	62340	I	678	“ Of course . Should have known . ”
62377	62380	62381	62381	I	678	“ Shot ? ”
62384	62389	62390	62390	Heidi	208	“ God , yes , ”
62425	62434	62435	62435	she	208	“ Good to have you back , baby , ”
62442	62459	62460	62460	Heidi	208	“ Now , tell me all about your Wright brother . Is he the right brother ? ”
62470	62480	62481	62481	Heidi	208	“ How many drinks did you have before this ? ”
62489	62494	62481	62481	Heidi	208	“ More than one . ”
62495	62498	62435	62435	she	208	“ Whore . ”
62499	62525	62481	62481	Heidi	208	“ I did n’t know you were back yet ! And Julia is in Ohio or wherever she ’s from . Somewhere cold and snowy . ”
62526	62534	62481	62481	Heidi	208	“ It ’s cold and snowy here . ”
62535	62544	62435	62435	she	208	“ Yeah , sometimes . But not today ! ”
62545	62578	62579	62579	Heidi	208	“ No , not today . But snow is on the forecast for forty - eight of the fifty states next week . Everywhere is cold , except for Florida and Hawaii . ”
62582	62602	62579	62579	Heidi	208	“ If only . Now , tell me about your sexy weekend . There were sexy times , right ? ”
62603	62606	62607	62607	I	678	“ Yes , ”
62610	62657	62658	62658	Heidi	208	“ We ran into my ex - boyfriend , and Jensen bought a million - dollar company from a man who his ex - wife cheated on him with . Then , when we came home , Landon was waiting for us at Jensen ’s house . ”
62680	62685	62686	62686	she	208	“ Oh my God , ”
62689	62696	62686	62686	she	208	“ Oh , phew ! Wow ! ”
62697	62706	62667	62667	She	208	“ What the hell are you laughing about ? ”
62707	62717	62718	62718	Heidi	208	“ Did you not hear how ridiculous you sounded ? ”
62727	62735	62721	62721	She	208	“ I just told you what happened ! ”
62736	62746	62747	62747	Heidi	208	“ Yeah . Yeah , you did . Wow ! ”
62763	62772	62759	62759	I	678	“ God , you ’re such a bitch . ”
62773	62779	62759	62759	I	678	“ You love me anyway . ”
62780	62783	62784	62784	I	678	“ True , ”
62787	62796	62797	62797	Heidi	208	“ So … Landon is back in town ? ”
62824	62841	62812	62812	I	678	“ Yeah . He just got into town with his wife . Not so great timing . ”
62842	62852	62807	62807	she	208	“ Did you see Miranda ? Was she there ? ”
62853	62866	62812	62812	I	678	“ Nah . Lucky for us . Sort of , I guess . ”
62867	62875	62876	62876	I	678	“ Yeah . She ’s a nutjob . ”
62879	62896	62876	62876	I	678	“ That ’s true . But Landon got upset when he saw Jensen and I together . ”
62897	62925	62812	62812	I	678	“ Landon is a big boy . He ’s a grown - up and married and living halfway across the country . He should n’t be upset . ”
62926	62929	62930	62930	I	678	“ Yeah , ”
62933	62994	62930	62930	I	678	“ But you did n’t see his face when he saw us together . I know I have n’t talked to him in forever , but I feel bad for Jensen that we did n’t tell him . After all , he ’s his brother and , we probably should have said something when we realized things were getting serious . ”
62995	62998	63008	63008	I	678	“ Serious ? ”
62999	63007	63008	63008	I	678	“ I guess we ’re official now , ”
63036	63049	63028	63028	Heidi	208	“ Okay . Well , we definitely need to toast to that . ”
63210	63213	63214	63214	I	678	“ What ? ”
63234	63240	63217	63217	I	678	“ Do n’t hate me . ”
63241	63249	63250	63250	I	678	“ Oh God , I already do . ”
63310	63317	63318	63318	I	678	“ Did you invite him here ? ”
63321	63339	63318	63318	I	678	“ Well , he texted me to find out where you were … and ta - da . ”
63340	63350	63351	63351	Landon	278	“ You ’re right . I do hate you . ”
63428	63431	63432	63432	he	2210	“ Hey , ”
63448	63451	63432	63432	he	2210	“ Hi . ”
63452	63457	63458	63458	Heidi	208	“ Hey , Landon ! ”
63475	63485	63465	63465	His	2210	“ Hey , Heidi . Thanks for the info . ”
63486	63497	63498	63498	She	208	“ For sure . Why do n’t you two just … ”
63513	63518	63519	63519	Landon	278	“ Do you mind ? ”
63538	63549	63550	63550	he	2210	“ Emery , I did n’t mean to ambush you , ”
63555	63565	63566	63566	He	2210	“ Why not ? I kind of ambushed you . ”
63571	63576	63566	63566	He	2210	“ Not on purpose . ”
63577	63580	63566	63566	He	2210	“ True . ”
63581	63588	63589	63589	I	678	“ I just wanted to apologize . ”
63628	63636	63613	63613	They	79	“ You want to apologize to me ? ”
63637	63657	63613	63613	They	79	“ Yeah , I just saw you there … with him … and I kind of blew a gasket . ”
63658	63663	63613	63613	They	79	“ I noticed that . ”
63664	63673	63674	63674	I	678	“ Which I had no right to do . ”
63744	63751	63752	63752	I	678	“ How are you and Jensen ? ”
63770	63779	63756	63756	Landon	278	“ I needed some time to cool off . ”
63780	63788	63789	63789	I	678	“ So , you came to me ? ”
63794	63816	63789	63789	I	678	“ Do n’t think we were ever the cool - off type . I think we argued most of the time . ”
63817	63825	63826	63826	he	76	“ Only so we could make up , ”
63840	63855	63832	63832	I	678	“ You know , Jensen and I did n’t mean for it to happen . ”
63856	63865	63866	63866	he	76	“ I do n’t really want to know , ”
63874	63892	63866	63866	he	76	“ It might have been ten years , Emery , but it ’s still weird to me . ”
63893	63902	63832	63832	I	678	“ It ’s weird to me , too . ”
63903	63909	63910	63910	Landon	278	“ Just … be careful , ”
63928	63985	63913	63913	He	76	“ I love my brother . But he ’s an asshole , and he ’s bad with women . Plus , he has more baggage than the rest of our family combined , and I think one Wright has hurt you enough for a lifetime . I would n’t want to see you like that again . ”
63998	64066	63913	63913	He	76	“ I know about Jensen ’s reputation and his past . I know that he has n’t always made the right decisions with women . But that does n’t necessarily mean that he ’s going to fuck this up , too . If I thought he was playing me , I would n’t be in his life . This is me we ’re talking about , Landon . ”
64067	64071	64072	64072	he	76	“ I know , ”
64075	64084	64085	64085	I	678	“ That ’s what I ’m afraid of . ”
64092	64135	64085	64085	I	678	“ You know what ? I ’ve had enough crap for one weekend . I apologized for not telling you about Jensen , but I ’m not leaving him because of it . And I ’m not being naive about our relationship . ”
64136	64145	64085	64085	I	678	“ I do n’t think you know him . ”
64146	64151	64152	64152	I	678	“ You ’re right , ”
64155	64189	64152	64152	I	678	“ I definitely do not know him like you do . How could I ? But that does n’t mean I do n’t care for him and want to get to know him . ”
64190	64202	64203	64203	I	678	“ I just do n’t want to see you get hurt . ”
64214	64227	64228	64228	Landon	278	“ It ’s about ten years too late for that , Landon . ”
64269	64278	64279	64279	he	278	“ That ’s fair . I deserve that , ”
64282	64333	64279	64279	he	278	“ Let me take care of myself . I ’ve been doing it long enough without your help . So , why do n’t we go and play some pool with Heidi and hang out for a while ? I ’d love to see Heidi hustle you like old times . ”
64355	64396	64341	64341	He	278	“ Okay , but I do n’t have that long . Miranda is almost finished shopping . It would be bad for both of our health if she found us in the same place , let alone at a bar . ”
64397	64405	64406	64406	I	678	“ She seems a bit … controlling , ”
64417	64428	64406	64406	I	678	“ I really do not want to talk about her . ”
64435	64438	64429	64429	I	678	“ Okay . ”
64439	64449	64450	64450	Heidi	208	“ What do n’t we want to talk about ? ”
64522	64525	64526	64526	Landon	278	“ Miranda , ”
64530	64536	64537	64537	Heidi	208	“ Is she coming here ? ”
64546	64551	64537	64537	Heidi	208	“ God , no . ”
64552	64591	64592	64592	I	678	“ We ’re trying to make sure everyone makes it out of this alive . I mostly want to see you kick Landon ’s ass in pool . So , hop to . Make this happen for me , ”
64607	64616	64601	64601	Her	208	“ You rack , and I ’ll break . ”
64617	64624	64625	64625	he	278	“ I ’d expect nothing less , ”
65089	65097	65082	65082	Morgan	86	“ Maybe you should let it go . ”
65108	65145	65082	65082	Morgan	86	“ I ca n’t just let it go . Landon is out there , pissed off at me . Emery is n’t answering my calls . What the fuck am I supposed to do , Morgan ? ”
65146	65157	65075	65075	she	1077	“ I do n’t know . You made this mess . ”
65158	65166	65082	65082	Morgan	86	“ Well aware of that . Thanks . ”
65167	65195	65082	65082	Morgan	86	“ Look , I ’m not patronizing you . But you knew this was going to happen . You knew that you would have to tell Landon . ”
65196	65202	65203	65203	I	678	“ And I planned to , ”
65214	65224	65203	65203	I	678	“ Then , you should have just done it . ”
65225	65230	65231	65231	I	678	“ You ’re right , ”
65237	65245	65246	65246	Morgan	86	“ Do you have Heidi ’s number ? ”
65249	65253	65246	65246	Morgan	86	“ I might . ”
65254	65259	65203	65203	I	678	“ I need it . ”
65260	65263	65203	65203	I	678	“ No . ”
65264	65268	65269	65269	I	678	“ Why not ? ”
65273	65311	65269	65269	I	678	“ Emery is not answering your calls for a reason , Jensen . Give her some time . I ’m sure that she is freaking out about all of this . No one likes to be ambushed . ”
65312	65321	65203	65203	I	678	“ So , I should let her walk ? ”
65322	65355	65356	65356	I	678	“ That ’s not what I ’m saying . I ’m saying , give her space . If you were the one freaking out , would you want her to bombard you ? ”
65417	65440	65441	65441	Morgan	86	“ Normally , no , but right now , I ’m considering going to her house to see if she ’s there . ”
65446	65453	65441	65441	Morgan	86	“ You men , so dramatic . ”
65454	65461	65462	65462	I	678	“ What if this were Patrick ? ”
65465	65521	65462	65462	I	678	“ This also has nothing to do with me or Patrick . Stop projecting . I can not believe I ’m even having this conversation with you . With Austin , sure . He ’s the one who fucks everything up . He even fucked up whatever was going on with that girl in HR . ”
65522	65525	65526	65526	I	678	“ Julia ? ”
65529	65534	65535	65535	Morgan	86	“ They were together ? ”
65538	65569	65570	65570	She	86	“ They ’re not anymore . But I thought you were always the one who had your shit together . Austin always has trouble with women . Landon has Miranda . ”
65573	65601	65570	65570	She	86	“ Enough said . But your life is put together , even with everything going on with Vanessa . Why are you acting crazy over one girl ? ”
65602	65643	65644	65644	I	678	“ I care about her . And I care about Landon . I do n’t want to see either of them hurt . Not knowing is making me feel insane . I have to go out there and do something . ”
65657	65667	65668	65668	Morgan	86	“ What exactly are you going to go do ? ”
65677	65693	65668	65668	Morgan	86	“ I do n’t know . I ’ll make it up as I go along . ”
65753	65763	65747	65747	She	43	“ Will you let me know how it goes ? ”
66037	66040	66041	66041	she	557	“ Jensen ? ”
66046	66060	66041	66041	she	557	“ Hey , Kimber . I did n’t mean to wake you up . ”
66061	66083	66084	66084	She	557	“ Oh , you did n’t . It ’s almost time , and it makes it kind of hard to sleep . ”
66098	66104	66084	66084	She	557	“ Can I help you ? ”
66105	66114	66115	66115	Kimber	227	“ I was hoping to talk to Emery . ”
66118	66135	66115	66115	Kimber	227	“ She went out hours ago to meet Heidi . She has n’t come home yet . ”
66136	66139	66140	66140	I	678	“ Oh , ”
66144	66148	66140	66140	I	678	“ I see . ”
66149	66156	66084	66084	She	557	“ Have you tried her cell ? ”
66157	66163	66084	66084	She	557	“ A couple of times . ”
66164	66202	66140	66140	I	678	“ Heidi is a bit of a bad influence . Love the girl to death and back , but they ’re trouble together . I ca n’t even tell you what they went through in high school . ”
66203	66208	66084	66084	She	557	“ I believe it . ”
66209	66234	66084	66084	She	557	“ Do you want me to give her a call and see where she is ? I did n’t even check before she left . ”
66235	66245	66140	66140	I	678	“ Uh , no . That ’s all right . ”
66246	66259	66260	66260	Kimber	227	“ Just come on inside . It will only be a minute , ”
66284	66309	66274	66274	She	227	“ I have a text here . Looks like Emery is on her way home . She should be here soon , I guess . ”
66358	66368	66369	66369	Kimber	227	“ You can stay and wait if you want ? ”
66372	66376	66377	66377	I	678	“ Oh no , ”
66384	66409	66377	66377	I	678	“ Uh , no . I ’ll check in with her tomorrow . If she ’s safe , then that ’s fine by me . ”
66417	66422	66410	66410	Kimber	227	“ Are you sure ? ”
66423	66426	66427	66427	I	678	“ Completely , ”
67277	67293	67294	67294	Landon	278	“ Are you going to be okay ? You look like you might throw up , ”
67297	67319	67320	67320	Landon	278	“ Just go check on Heidi . If she vomits in that Mercedes , Jensen is going to be sooooo pissed . ”
67327	67336	67320	67320	Landon	278	“ Man , you ’re so fucked up . ”
67337	67346	67347	67347	I	678	“ This is all . Your . Fault , ”
67377	67391	67370	67370	I	678	“ Where is your key ? Do you still not carry a purse ? ”
67392	67404	67405	67405	I	678	“ As if the key would magically appear in a purse , ”
67419	67438	67405	67405	I	678	“ It ’d be full of other junk I did n’t need . I ’d never find it . ”
67439	67454	67370	67370	I	678	“ You ca n’t find it now , and it ’s in your pocket . ”
67455	67469	67470	67470	I	678	“ Judgy McJudgerson does n’t find pockets acceptable . You only have pockets , ”
67480	67492	67493	67493	Landon	278	“ Do not make me look through your pockets for you , ”
67499	67510	67493	67493	Landon	278	“ God , if my wife saw me right now . ”
67511	67517	67518	67518	I	678	“ Her head would explode , ”
67532	67537	67538	67538	he	278	“ Something like that , ”
67541	67557	67558	67558	I	678	“ So , hurry up , so I can get home and incur her wrath . ”
67590	67599	67600	67600	he	278	“ Here you go . Inside with you , ”
67638	67643	67644	67644	I	678	“ Hey , Kimmy , ”
67648	67651	67652	67652	Kimber	227	“ Landon ? ”
67656	67661	67662	67662	he	278	“ Hey , Kimber , ”
67669	67680	67681	67681	she	227	“ That is not the Wright brother I was expecting , ”
67703	67728	67729	67729	he	278	“ Just wanted to make sure she got home safe . Caught her at Flips with Heidi , and they needed a ride home , ”
67733	67737	67738	67738	She	227	“ I see . ”
67750	67762	67763	67763	She	227	“ Do n’t you have a wife to get home to ? ”
67803	67814	67815	67815	Landon	278	“ Good seeing you again , Kimber . Good night , ”
67818	67822	67823	67823	she	227	“ Good night , ”
67842	67850	67832	67832	She	227	“ What have you gotten yourself into ? ”
67851	67854	67832	67832	She	227	“ Clouds . ”
67855	67858	67832	67832	She	227	“ Clouds ? ”
67859	67867	67832	67832	She	227	“ They ’re twirling on the ceiling . ”
67868	67886	67832	67832	She	227	“ Oh God , you ’re so drunk . Why did n’t you answer Jensen ’s calls ? ”
67887	67893	67894	67894	I	678	“ He did n’t call , ”
67932	67939	67940	67940	Kimber	227	“ Um … it ’s dead . ”
67945	67966	67940	67940	Kimber	227	“ Well , charge it , and give him a call . He was here earlier , looking for you . ”
67967	67971	67972	67972	I	678	“ He was ? ”
67983	67986	67972	67972	I	678	“ Why ? ”
67987	68020	67940	67940	Kimber	227	“ He would n’t say , but he seemed concerned . And , since I just saw you with his brother and your ex - boyfriend , I could see his concern . ”
68021	68086	67972	67972	I	678	“ Whoa ! Wait a second , Kimmy . Reel that mom voice back in . There ’s so nothing going on with me and Landon . He just apologized to me for blowing up on me when he found out about Jensen . He played pool with Heidi . We had a few drinks . He drove us both home . No big . ”
68087	68106	68107	68107	I	678	“ All right . What do I know ? Just happily married with no drama in my life . ”
68110	68115	68107	68107	I	678	“ I love you . ”
68116	68131	68132	68132	I	678	“ I love you , too . Now , go . Charge . Now . ”
68978	68984	68985	68986	his receptionist	1267	“ Mr. Wright ’s office , ”
68989	68996	68985	68986	his receptionist	1267	“ How can I help you ? ”
68997	69014	68985	68986	his receptionist	1267	“ Hi . Um … this is Emery . I was wondering if Jensen was in . ”
69015	69037	69038	69038	I	678	“ Unfortunately , Mr. Wright is out of the office today , but I would be happy to take a message . ”
69054	69067	69068	69068	I	678	“ Do you know when he ’s going to be back in ? ”
69071	69081	69068	69068	I	678	“ Mr. Wright is away on business right now . ”
69082	69087	69088	69088	I	678	“ Away on business ? ”
69093	69138	69088	69088	I	678	“ Yes . He had to go to New York at the last minute to take care of some business . I ’m not sure when he will be back in the office , but I could get him a message if you like . ”
69455	69464	69448	69448	she	215	“ What the hell are you doing here ? ”
69494	69499	69500	69500	I	678	“ Um … hi , ”
69511	69516	69500	69500	I	678	“ Is Jensen here ? ”
69517	69524	69525	69525	Miranda	215	“ You ca n’t fool me , ”
69569	69593	69594	69594	I	678	“ I know why you ’re really here , and if you get near my husband , I ’ll file a restraining order . ”
69600	69613	69594	69594	I	678	“ No interest in your husband . Just trying to find Jensen . ”
69635	69644	69622	69622	He	278	“ Emery ? What are you doing here ? ”
69645	69678	69683	69683	Miranda	215	“ Came looking for Jensen . I have n’t seen him since last night . He ’s not answering my messages , and his receptionist said that he was away on business . ”
69679	69682	69683	69683	Miranda	215	“ Landon ! ”
69686	69720	69683	69683	Miranda	215	“ Why the fuck are you talking to her right now ? I thought we discussed this before we left Tampa . I would come if you did n’t go anywhere near her ! ”
69721	69728	69729	69729	I	678	“ Hello ? Standing right here , ”
69732	69745	69729	69729	I	678	“ I ’m not interested in Landon . I ’m dating Jensen . ”
69746	69753	69683	69683	Miranda	215	“ I ’m not an idiot . ”
69779	69786	69772	69772	I	678	“ Help ? Thoughts ? Anything ? ”
69787	69790	69791	69791	Miranda	215	“ Landon ! ”
69794	69805	69806	69806	He	278	“ Just give me a minute , honey , okay ? ”
69816	69821	69806	69806	He	278	“ Just one minute . ”
69822	69839	69772	69772	I	678	“ I can not believe this . You are so going to owe me for this . ”
69840	69853	69854	69854	he	278	“ Just one minute . Do n’t you have a tennis lesson ? ”
69857	69869	69878	69878	he	278	“ Do n’t you dare try to get rid of me . ”
69870	69877	69878	69878	he	278	“ I ’ll be right back , ”
69907	69928	69899	69899	he	278	“ What the fuck are you doing here , Emery ? Miranda is going to murder me in my sleep . ”
69929	69948	69887	69887	his	278	“ Jensen is gone and not returning my messages . What did you say to him last night ? ”
69949	69966	69899	69899	he	278	“ I do n’t know . I was pissed last night . Said some dumb things . ”
69967	69972	69973	69973	I	678	“ What dumb things ? ”
69976	70009	69973	69973	I	678	“ It was just me overreacting . I was going to talk to him this morning to try to clear the air , but when I woke up , he was gone . ”
70010	70016	70017	70017	I	678	“ What did you say ? ”
70026	70038	70017	70017	I	678	“ I might have said you were too good for him . ”
70039	70042	70043	70043	I	678	“ Ugh ! ”
70046	70077	70078	70078	Landon	278	“ Great . I do n’t know what he ’s thinking , but he ’s gone . He went to New York . Why would he be in New York ? ”
70103	70109	70110	70110	I	678	“ What ? Tell me ! ”
70116	70119	70110	70110	I	678	“ Nothing . ”
70120	70127	70110	70110	I	678	“ Landon ! Is it Vanessa ? ”
70128	70163	70110	70110	I	678	“ I know Vanessa has a place in New York , but that does n’t mean he went to see her . He ’s probably working . That ’s all he normally does anyway . ”
70164	70183	70184	70184	I	678	“ Landon , why would he go see his ex - wife ? Why would he do that ? ”
70250	70255	70256	70256	I	678	“ It ’s complicated . ”
70259	70266	70256	70256	I	678	“ Then , make it uncomplicated . ”
70267	70282	70256	70256	I	678	“ I ca n’t . You should just … talk to Jensen about this . ”
70283	70288	70289	70289	I	678	“ I ca n’t ! ”
70294	70302	70289	70289	I	678	“ He wo n’t return my messages . ”
70303	70317	70256	70256	I	678	“ I ’m sorry , Emery . I ca n’t talk about it . ”
70318	70325	70256	70256	I	678	“ Ca n’t talk about what ? ”
70326	70329	70330	70330	he	278	“ Nothing , ”
70334	70367	70330	70330	he	278	“ Do n’t jump to any conclusions . It ’s not Vanessa . This is normal Jensen behavior . He ’ll come back soon and then all will be back to normal . ”
70632	70640	70641	70642	my mother	239	“ Look what the cat dragged in , ”
70655	70666	70645	70645	she	239	“ Ha , Mom . Never heard that one before . ”
70683	70707	70708	70708	I	678	“ Well , I was going to let Gary Lupton drive me to church , but I suppose you ’re a worthy substitute . ”
70711	70717	70708	70708	I	678	“ What about Harry Stevenson ? ”
70718	70728	70708	70708	I	678	“ A girl has to have options , Emery . ”
70729	70735	70736	70736	She	239	“ Oh God , Mom ! ”
70745	70770	70736	70736	She	239	“ Do n’t be such a prude . I know you ’re seeing Jensen Wright . Everyone knows that he is n’t a prude . ”
70782	70803	70771	70771	I	678	“ I really , really do n’t want to talk about my love life . Thanks , but no thanks . ”
70804	70820	70736	70736	She	239	“ Why do you have to be like this ? I thought we were bonding . ”
70821	70841	70842	70842	I	678	“ I ca n’t bond with you over who you ’re having sex with . It grosses me out , ”
70853	70898	70842	70842	I	678	“ Well , you refuse to come by and see me . You are n’t getting married . You are n’t getting your degree anymore . You hate shopping and pedicures and makeovers . What exactly am I supposed to bond with you over ? ”
70899	70906	70907	70907	I	678	“ Hey , I like pedicures ! ”
70910	70933	70907	70907	I	678	“ But just because I ’m not … Kimber does n’t mean that I do n’t have my own qualities or whatever . ”
70934	70972	70842	70842	I	678	“ I only needle you because I love you . I just want to make sure you ’re happy . I do n’t want to see you waste your life away at the Buddy Holly Center again . ”
70973	70982	70983	70983	I	678	“ You set me up to work there ! ”
70986	70999	70983	70983	I	678	“ Temporarily . I thought you ’d be going back to school . ”
71000	71007	71008	71008	I	678	“ Well , I ’m not , ”
71051	71087	71022	71023	my mother	239	“ You used to be so full of love for things . Things I hated but you loved them . Soccer and that horrendous skateboard and coaching and tutoring after school and honors society and — ”
71088	71111	71022	71023	my mother	239	“ Yes , I get it . But , now , I ’m adrift , and I need something of my own . ”
71112	71115	71116	71116	I	678	“ Exactly . ”
71121	71128	71116	71116	I	678	“ I ’ll figure it out . ”
71140	71171	71132	71132	her	239	“ Maybe you should consider working at the high school . You have the degrees . You ’d need to be certified , but I know you could do it . ”
71172	71177	71178	71178	I	678	“ High school students ? ”
71181	71188	71189	71189	I	678	“ You ’d make a difference . ”
71344	71350	71332	71332	I	678	“ Just think about it , ”
71363	71366	71367	71367	I	678	“ Okay , ”
71370	71377	71367	71367	I	678	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
71378	71394	71395	71395	I	678	“ Good , or else I ’d have to start talking about Jensen Wright again . ”
71403	71408	71395	71395	I	678	“ You kill me . ”
71409	71416	71417	71417	she	557	“ I love you , too , ”
71570	71580	71581	71581	Miranda	215	“ Ugh ! Are you literally following me everywhere ? ”
71628	71635	71636	71636	I	678	“ I go to church here , ”
71642	71653	71636	71636	I	678	“ Uh - huh . Oh , I ’m sure . ”
71654	71657	71658	71658	Landon	278	“ Miranda , ”
71666	71673	71658	71658	Landon	278	“ let ’s just go inside . ”
71674	71684	71636	71636	I	678	“ You knew she was going to be here . ”
71685	71706	71636	71636	I	678	“ We ’ve gone to the same church since we were kids , Miranda . I ca n’t help that . ”
71707	71714	71715	71715	she	215	“ And I get no warning ? ”
71718	71726	71727	71727	I	678	“ You do n’t need a warning , ”
71730	71746	71727	71727	I	678	“ because there ’s nothing going on here , and you ’re worrying for nothing . ”
71747	71762	71765	71765	she	215	“ Do n’t tell me how I feel . Just stay away from us . ”
72102	72110	72086	72086	I	678	“ Where the hell have you been ? ”
72111	72116	72117	72117	he	2210	“ Language , Emery , ”
72124	72130	72131	72131	I	678	“ Do n’t do that , ”
72135	72142	72131	72131	I	678	“ Just answer the damn question . ”
72143	72151	72120	72120	his	2210	“ I ’ve been in New York . ”
72152	72165	72131	72131	I	678	“ Why have n’t you answered any of my calls or messages ? ”
72166	72172	72173	72173	he	2210	“ I ’ve been busy , ”
72192	72244	72245	72245	I	678	“ I ’m missing something here . What the hell happened ? Is it because I did n’t answer your calls that night ? My phone died , and I did n’t see you ’d called until I got home . I called you back as soon as I charged it , ”
72249	72255	72245	72245	I	678	“ Not as soon as . ”
72256	72264	72265	72265	I	678	“ What the hell does that mean ? ”
72272	72287	72288	72288	He	2210	“ I really do n’t want to get into this with you , Emery . ”
72303	72308	72296	72296	I	678	“ Was it Vanessa ? ”
72318	72324	72309	72309	Jensen	2210	“ What do you mean ? ”
72325	72341	72342	72342	I	678	“ Do you still love her ? Is that why you were in New York ? ”
72375	72384	72367	72367	I	678	“ You ask me that after last week ? ”
72385	72391	72392	72392	I	678	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
72413	72450	72402	72402	He	2210	“ I saw you with Landon . I saw the way you were all over him that night . Landon is still in love with you , and it sure looked like you felt the same . ”
72481	72489	72490	72490	I	678	“ That is not what you saw ! ”
72494	72500	72490	72490	I	678	“ Save it , Emery . ”
73039	73045	73046	73046	she	1638	“ You ’re an idiot , ”
73049	73053	73054	73054	I	678	“ Not now , ”
73057	73076	73054	73054	I	678	“ Yes ! Right now . I ’ve waited all week for this . Why wait another minute ? ”
73095	73105	73084	73084	she	1638	“ Fine . Let ’s do this somewhere else . ”
73106	73109	73110	73110	she	1638	“ Fine , ”
73113	73117	73110	73110	she	1638	“ Outside then . ”
73185	73193	73194	73194	I	678	“ All right , we ’re outside , ”
73197	73209	73194	73194	I	678	“ What is it that you have to say to me ? ”
73210	73221	73228	73228	She	1638	“ You ’re being such an incredible idiot right now . ”
73222	73227	73228	73228	She	1638	“ You mentioned that . ”
73234	73243	73228	73228	She	1638	“ I ca n’t do this , Jensen . ”
73244	73250	73251	73251	I	678	“ Ca n’t do what ? ”
73261	73310	73251	73251	I	678	“ You do n’t trust me . You do n’t value my opinion . You could n’t even bother to talk to me . You ran at the first sign of trouble . Then , when things got tough , you went to see your ex - wife . ”
73311	73324	73228	73228	She	1638	“ This has nothing to do with Vanessa . You know that . ”
73325	73328	73329	73329	she	1638	“ How ? ”
73332	73399	73228	73228	She	1638	“ How could I know that ? Do I know anything at all about what the hell this is about ? You ’re pissed about Landon . Then , you ran to your ex , and you expect me to not care about that ? Look at how you reacted when you thought something had happened with Landon . I have every right to be upset . ”
73400	73404	73405	73405	I	678	“ You do , ”
73456	73478	73448	73448	She	1638	“ But it does n’t change what I saw or how you feel about Landon or how Landon feels about you . ”
73479	73502	73503	73503	she	1638	“ Oh my God , give it a rest ! I do not love Landon , and Landon does not love me , ”
73506	73513	73448	73448	She	1638	“ I know what I saw . ”
73514	73602	73448	73448	She	1638	“ No , you do n’t . You really do n’t . You have never given me a chance to explain what you think you saw . I ca n’t sit around and let you walk all over my heart , Jensen . I put myself out there after I ’d been hurt . And then , at the first sign of trouble , you ditched me . And all of it could have been fixed with one little conversation that you refused to have with me . ”
73603	73628	73448	73448	She	1638	“ If you think that one conversation will magically change everything , then tell me what I saw . Tell me what really happened . ”
73629	73712	73448	73448	She	1638	“ Look , the night you saw me with Landon was in no way romantic . He came to apologize to me for being a dick when he found us together . Then , Heidi and I got drunk , and he offered both of us a ride home . I was too drunk to walk to the front door , so he helped me . I got inside and immediately called you . The end . That ’s the whole story . ”
73713	73722	73448	73448	She	1638	“ And you were all over him because … ”
73723	73789	73790	73790	I	678	“ One , I was not all over him . Two , I was drunk , and I ’m not a good drunk . I ’m a face - plant - into - the - concrete - and - bust - my - nose - and - get - two - black - eyes kind of drunk . Trust me , I ’ve been there . ”
73801	73809	73810	73810	I	678	“ That ’s really all that happened ? ”
73858	73861	73862	73862	she	1732	“ Yes ! ”
73867	73933	73862	73862	she	1732	“ And you would know that if you had bothered to pick up the phone . Go ask Landon . Go ask Heidi ! She was in the car that night . If anything , I think that Heidi might be into Landon . Not me ! I do n’t understand what I did to make you not trust me , but I hate this . ”
73934	73937	73938	73938	I	678	“ Emery , ”
73947	73951	73952	73952	she	1732	“ Save it , ”
73964	73969	73970	73970	I	678	“ You ’re right , ”
73981	73985	73974	73974	She	1732	“ I am ? ”
73986	73994	73952	73952	she	1732	“ Yes . I am an idiot . ”
73995	74006	73974	73974	She	1732	“ Well , that ’s very obvious at this point . ”
74007	74065	74066	74066	Her	1732	“ What I ’m trying to say is , I was so afraid of losing you that I pushed you away . I made assumptions . It did n’t help that Landon had said that , if I did n’t know what had really happened in your breakup , then I did n’t know you at all . ”
74072	74077	74078	74078	she	1732	“ He said what ? ”
74081	74094	74078	74078	she	1732	“ Oh , I ’m going to kill him , I swear . ”
74095	74108	74109	74109	I	678	“ What I ’m saying is that I want a second chance , ”
74117	74144	74109	74109	I	678	“ I do n’t want to argue with you , and I do n’t want to run . I was an idiot . A complete idiot . ”
74145	74151	74152	74152	she	1732	“ I do n’t know , ”
74162	74174	74152	74152	she	1732	“ How do I know that this wo n’t happen again ? ”
74175	74240	74241	74241	She	1732	“ You do n’t . But I do n’t know how else to make this right . We both have pasts . We both have issues . Trust is mine . After what happened in my past , I have a hard time taking anyone at face value . But I ’d really like to try to handle everything together . To start over . ”
74244	74247	74241	74241	She	1732	“ Jensen … ”
74248	74258	74259	74259	Snow	180	“ Give me a chance , Emery . Please . ”
74317	74320	74321	74321	she	1732	“ Okay , ”
74325	74335	74321	74321	she	1732	“ One chance , Jensen . That ’s it . ”
74372	74379	74380	74380	I	678	“ You wo n’t regret it , ”
74398	74405	74386	74386	She	1732	“ I hated the last week . ”
74406	74418	74386	74386	She	1732	“ Me , too . I hated being away from you . ”
74419	74427	74428	74428	I	678	“ Why are you such an ass ? ”
74431	74439	74386	74386	She	1732	“ Ca n’t seem to help it . ”
74440	74449	74386	74386	She	1732	“ God , we ’re so fucked up . ”
74450	74453	74386	74386	She	1732	“ Emery ? ”
74454	74457	74386	74386	She	1732	“ Hmm ? ”
74458	74468	74469	74469	She	1732	“ What really happened with your breakup with Landon ? ”
74483	74490	74491	74491	I	678	“ You really want to know ? ”
74494	74523	74491	74491	I	678	“ Yes . I would like to be on equal footing . Figure things out together . That way , maybe neither of us will be blindsided again . ”
74524	74528	74529	74529	She	1732	“ All right . ”
74541	74614	74529	74529	She	1732	“ Landon and I had dated nearly two years when he got into Stanford on a golf scholarship , and I got into Oklahoma as a National Merit Scholar , but both of us wanted to stay home and go to Texas Tech , so we could be together . We had this whole plan . Then … as far as I know , your father told him to go to Stanford . ”
74615	74619	74620	74620	I	678	“ No way , ”
74623	74648	74649	74649	She	1304	“ My father wanted nothing more than for all of us to go to Texas Tech , just like him and all our relatives . ”
74652	74699	74649	74649	She	1304	“ I was there . This is what happened . He thought Landon should be more serious about school and about sports . He wanted Landon to go to Stanford and try to walk onto the football team , which Landon did n’t want to do . ”
74700	74709	74529	74529	She	1732	“ That at least sounds like my father . ”
74710	74795	74796	74796	I	678	“ Yeah . Landon was a good football player , but he always preferred golf . He got into a huge argument with your dad one night right before the deadline where we both had to decide where we were going to school . His dad said that he needed to break up with me or something like , if I was so important , then we could make it work long distance . As you know , your dad died shortly after that . ”
74808	74828	74802	74802	I	678	“ Landon felt … responsible for what happened . As if that argument had pushed him over the edge . ”
74829	74838	74649	74649	She	1304	“ He was n’t and it did n’t . ”
74839	74901	74649	74649	She	1304	“ I knew that ; I still know that . But the last thing that he ever said to your dad was something mean , and he could n’t cope . He accepted the full ride to Stanford because that ’s what your dad had wanted , and I took the Oklahoma spot . Then , Landon was just … gone . ”
74902	74905	74802	74802	I	678	“ Gone ? ”
74906	74984	74649	74649	She	1304	“ Adrift . I tried to bring him back and to help , but he disappeared those next couple of weeks before graduation . We were still together . I knew he still loved me , but he was broken . So , he broke up with me the day of graduation . He told me that he ’d talked it over with his family — with you — and you ’d all agreed it was best . ”
74985	75009	74649	74649	She	1304	“ We never talked about this . He told me that you were going to different colleges , and you ’d grown apart . ”
75010	75022	75023	75023	She	1305	“ Well , I see now that you did n’t know . ”
75027	75122	75123	75123	I	678	“ But , as you can imagine , as an eighteen - year - old , I was heartbroken . He still loved me . I still loved him . I knew he was only doing this because of what happened to your father . I tried calling him and messaging him and emailing him . No answer . He just disappeared off the face of the planet . I know he got my messages . He never blocked me . He knew how much I was hurting and ignored it . Sound familiar ? ”
75172	75177	75163	75163	I	678	“ I ’m sorry . ”
75178	75182	75183	75183	she	1306	“ I know , ”
75186	75238	75183	75183	she	1306	“ But , as you can see , history repeating itself was n’t so good on my psyche . Landon made his choice all those years ago . I know he did what he thought was right . I just hated all of you for a long time because of him . ”
75294	75307	75308	75308	Emery	128	“ So , since we ’re being all open and honest now , ”
75316	75328	75308	75308	Emery	128	“ Did you see Vanessa when you were in New York ? ”
75329	75333	75334	75334	I	678	“ I did , ”
75408	75430	75393	75393	I	678	“ But I did n’t go there to see her , and absolutely nothing happened . I was there for business . ”
75431	75443	75456	75456	She	1308	“ Landon said it was complicated between the two of you . ”
75444	75452	75453	75453	I	678	“ It is . Vanessa is complicated , ”
75479	75487	75488	75488	I	678	“ But it ’s not like that , ”
75492	75515	75488	75488	I	678	“ I told you once that I could never be with her after what had happened , and that has n’t changed . ”
75516	75525	75456	75456	She	1308	“ Then , why did you see her ? ”
75526	75540	75488	75488	I	678	“ We ’re divorced , but not … disentangled . It ’s complicated . ”
75541	75544	75545	75545	God	2256	“ Disentangled ? ”
75556	75592	75593	75593	I	678	“ I ’m working on the disentangling , part of the reason I went up there . Plus , I was selling off a part of Tarman . I bought the company to dismantle it , ”
75620	75628	75629	75629	she	1308	“ That ’s not really an answer , ”
75633	75640	75629	75629	she	1308	“ Why did you see her ? ”
75641	75652	75603	75603	She	1308	“ She still lives in my apartment in New York . ”
75653	75664	75629	75629	she	1308	“ Why the hell would you let her live there ? ”
75665	75673	75674	75674	I	678	“ This is part of the disentangling , ”
75685	75690	75679	75679	I	678	“ And nothing happened ? ”
75691	75696	75697	75697	I	678	“ Emery , no , ”
75701	75708	75709	75709	she	1308	“ I know , I know , ”
75716	75740	75741	75741	God	2256	“ I should trust you in return . If you said it ’s not like that , then it ’s not like that . ”
75829	75834	75835	75835	I	678	“ I ’m sorry , ”
75854	75917	75846	75846	I	678	“ I knew , even while I was doing it , that what I was doing was wrong . I just … fuck , I was just so angry . I felt like I was going through the same shit again . But , this time , I would not just be hurting the woman I love but my brother , too . ”
75918	75921	75922	75922	she	1308	“ Love ? ”
75932	75937	75925	75925	Her	1308	“ You love me ? ”
75938	75943	75944	75944	I	678	“ Oh , Emery , ”
75972	75979	75960	75960	I	678	“ Of course I love you . ”
76251	76259	76260	76260	Heidi	208	“ Why do you look so nervous ? ”
76279	76285	76286	76286	I	678	“ I ’m not nervous , ”
76289	76295	76296	76296	Julia	100	“ Yes , you are , ”
76341	76353	76354	76354	Heidi	208	“ Things are rocky , and you have turtle head now , ”
76357	76361	76362	76362	I	678	“ Turtle head ? ”
76368	76388	76389	76389	Heidi	208	“ Yeah , you ’re crawling back into your shell because you ’re worried he ’ll fuck up again , ”
76392	76402	76403	76403	Heidi	208	“ I ’m not worried . I ’m cautious . ”
76408	76414	76403	76403	Heidi	208	“ Yep . Turtle head . ”
76415	76422	76423	76423	I	678	“ Would n’t you be cautious ? ”
76426	76432	76433	76433	Heidi	208	“ I do n’t know , ”
76439	76455	76433	76433	Heidi	208	“ He abandoned me for a week . I ’m trying to take it easy . ”
76456	76465	76466	76466	Heidi	208	“ Just try to have fun , okay ? ”
76509	76512	76513	76513	Julia	100	“ Good , ”
76516	76530	76513	76513	Julia	100	“ Now we need to find someone for me to kiss at midnight . ”
76531	76537	76538	76538	Heidi	208	“ Oh , me too ! ”
76541	76544	76545	76545	I	678	“ Landon ? ”
76559	76568	76551	76551	Heidi	208	“ What ? No ! He ’s married ! ”
76569	76576	76513	76513	Julia	100	“ What if he was n’t ? ”
76577	76587	76551	76551	Heidi	208	“ Then he ’d be your ex - boyfriend . ”
76588	76597	76551	76551	Heidi	208	“ I ’m dating his brother , Heidi . ”
76598	76621	76622	76622	I	678	“ Nuh - uh . No way . This is girl code we ’re talking about ! Sacred shit here , Em . ”

76825	76833	76819	76819	She	557	“ Mom ! My boyfriend is here ! ”
76842	76853	76854	76854	Jensen	2210	“ We are going to need to break that habit . ”
76860	76868	76854	76854	Jensen	2210	“ How are you doing , munchkin ? ”
76869	76877	76878	76878	she	557	“ Fine . Thank you for asking , ”
76882	76891	76878	76878	she	557	“ We should have another ice cream date . ”
76892	76896	76897	76897	he	2210	“ We should , ”
76906	76917	76918	76918	Lilyanne	557	“ Good . I know how to fix the flowers , ”
76963	76966	76967	76967	he	2210	“ Wow , ”
76975	76980	76967	76967	he	2210	“ You look amazing . ”
77023	77030	77013	77021	the confident , sexy woman he claimed to love	1326	“ You look pretty good yourself . ”
77031	77036	77037	77037	He	2210	“ That dress though . ”
77076	77079	77080	77080	He	2210	“ Thanks . ”
77093	77097	77080	77080	He	2210	“ After you . ”
77116	77125	77126	77126	I	678	“ What ? Are we going to prom ? ”
77134	77142	77129	77129	Jensen	2210	“ Did n’t you go with Landon ? ”
77143	77150	77129	77129	Jensen	2210	“ Oh , yeah . Twice . ”
77151	77161	77129	77129	Jensen	2210	“ Then , nope . No prom for you . ”
77162	77166	77167	77167	Jensen	2210	“ Fair enough . ”
77233	77237	77238	77238	I	678	“ Mariah Carey ? ”
77241	77248	77238	77238	I	678	“ You ’re playing Mariah Carey ? ”
77249	77268	77238	77238	I	678	“ Look , I know she made a fool of herself , but she is our singer now . ”
77269	77283	77238	77238	I	678	“ Oh my God , it ’s ‘ Always Be My Baby . ’ ”
77284	77287	77238	77238	I	678	“ And ? ”
77288	77295	77296	77296	He	2210	“ This is a good choice . ”
77369	77374	77375	77375	He	2210	“ More , please . ”
77384	77401	77375	77375	He	2210	“ Do n’t get face - plant - on - the - concrete drunk on me . ”
77402	77409	77410	77410	I	678	“ I ’m a good girl , ”
77413	77420	77421	77421	Jensen	2210	“ Do n’t bet on it . ”
77434	77449	77421	77421	Jensen	2210	“ Now , before we get there , I do have your Christmas present . ”
77450	77469	77470	77470	We	1332	“ My what ? But it ’s New Year ’s and I thought we were n’t exchanging gifts . ”
77492	77505	77421	77421	Jensen	2210	“ Yes . Then , fine , your New Year ’s present . ”
77506	77516	77517	77517	Jensen	2210	“ But I do n’t have anything for you . ”
77525	77533	77534	77534	He	2210	“ I absolutely do not need anything . ”
77603	77610	77611	77611	he	2210	“ Go on . Open it , ”
77667	77672	77664	77664	my	678	“ I ca n’t … ”
77673	77682	77689	77689	I	678	“ It ’s a present . You can . ”
77683	77688	77689	77689	I	678	“ Wow . Okay , ”
77692	77700	77689	77689	I	678	“ Will you put it on me ? ”
77763	77774	77754	77755	the man	1073	“ Thank you . It ’s really too much though . ”
77775	77789	77790	77790	I	678	“ Emery , for you , it ’s never going to be enough . ”
77808	77822	77754	77755	the man	1073	“ A girl could get used to this if you ’re not careful . ”
77823	77887	77888	77888	I	678	“ I ’m not planning on being careful . Kid gloves are off . You might have to endure fancy dinners and random presents and unplanned trips on my private jet . This is the man I am , Emery , as much as the man I am when I ’m with you . I ’d like to have you in both worlds . ”
77998	78001	78002	78002	Morgan	86	“ Oh ! ”
78005	78012	78013	78013	I	678	“ He gave you the necklace . ”
78019	78022	78013	78013	I	678	“ Yes . ”
78023	78030	78013	78013	I	678	“ It looks great on you . ”
78031	78035	78013	78013	I	678	“ Thank you . ”
78036	78064	78065	78065	I	678	“ I ’m so glad things are going well again . Jensen gets so cranky when he ’s being a total idiot and refuses to admit it . ”
78072	78082	78083	78083	I	678	“ I ’m glad things are going well too , ”
78089	78108	78083	78083	I	678	“ Also , I ’m so happy that you ’re here . Seriously . The whole family is . ”
78122	78142	78109	78109	I	678	“ I think I ’m just going to slip to the restroom while Jensen waits in that outrageous line . ”
78143	78147	78148	78148	Morgan	86	“ All right , ”
78151	78161	78148	78148	Morgan	86	“ Do you want me to come with you ? ”
78162	78178	78181	78181	I	678	“ Nah , I ’m okay . I ’ll just be back in a minute . ”
78241	78246	78247	78247	I	678	“ Oh ! Sorry , ”
78256	78265	78266	78266	she	863	“ Just the person I was looking for , ”
78294	78299	78320	78320	She	863	“ Have we met ? ”
78300	78319	78320	78320	She	863	“ We have n’t had the pleasure . I ’m glad to rectify that . I ’m Vanessa . ”
78361	78367	78343	78343	she	863	“ Vanessa , as in … ”
78368	78375	78378	78378	she	863	“ Yes , Jensen ’s Vanessa . ”
78502	78509	78510	78510	I	678	“ What are you doing here ? ”
78513	78524	78510	78510	I	678	“ Well , I came here to be with Jensen . ”
78525	78535	78536	78536	I	678	“ Too bad . He ’s here with me , ”
78544	78549	78550	78550	she	863	“ Ah , yes , ”
78575	78584	78566	78566	she	863	“ Are you the flavor of the week ? ”
78585	78621	78566	78566	she	863	“ Nope . I ’m his girlfriend . So , you should probably just leave . I do n’t want to have to deal with you when we ’re having a perfectly good night together . ”
78622	78625	78626	78626	Vanessa	2268	“ Girlfriend , ”
78648	78662	78645	78645	I	678	“ Believe what you want to believe . I really do n’t care . ”
78663	78680	78681	78681	My	678	“ But how could you be his girlfriend when he stayed with me all last week ? ”
78707	78728	78645	78645	I	678	“ I knew he was in New York and that he saw you . I doubt he stayed with you . ”
78729	78747	78748	78748	she	2268	“ I saw you walk in here with him , but he never even mentioned you once , ”
78757	78801	78748	78748	she	2268	“ Jensen told me he saw you and that there was nothing there . I know that you cheated on him . I know that he divorced you for it . If you came here for a catfight , consider me tapped out . ”
78869	78878	78879	78879	My	678	“ But did he tell you about Colton ? ”
78895	78902	78892	78892	he	2210	“ Of course he did n’t , ”
78910	78919	78903	78903	Vanessa	2268	“ Because you ’re clearly just a fling . ”
78965	78977	78978	78978	Vanessa	2268	“ Just face it . You could never compare to me , ”
78988	79000	79004	79004	Jensen	2210	“ How could you compare to the mother of his son ? ”
79005	79012	79013	79013	I	678	“ She should be back already , ”
79172	79181	79182	79182	I	678	“ What could be taking her this long ? ”
79189	79212	79185	79185	Austin	1648	“ Do n’t know , man . There ’s probably just a line . You know how the girls ’ restroom is . ”
79213	79218	79219	79219	I	678	“ Right , line , ”
79377	79380	79381	79381	I	678	“ Hey , ”
79407	79413	79414	79414	she	1358	“ I want to leave , ”
79426	79432	79418	79418	She	1358	“ Emery , what happened ? ”
79433	79441	79442	79442	she	1358	“ I said I want to leave , ”
79449	79460	79442	79442	she	1358	“ Okay , okay . I ’ll get your coat . ”
79517	79522	79509	79509	she	1358	“ Let ’s go . ”
79523	79529	79530	79530	I	678	“ Emery , what happened ? ”
79555	79562	79563	79563	She	1358	“ Please , talk to me . ”
79574	79582	79583	79583	I	678	“ Why do n’t you ask Vanessa ? ”
79590	79593	79583	79583	I	678	“ Vanessa ? ”
79594	79608	79609	79609	My	678	“ Yes , your ex - wife . She can help you out . ”
79616	79621	79609	79609	My	678	“ She ’s here ? ”
79622	79628	79629	79629	she	1358	“ What do you think ? ”
79786	79795	79776	79776	Emery	1077	“ I ’m leaving with or without you . ”
79796	79800	79801	79801	I	678	“ With me , ”
79805	79808	79809	79809	she	2268	“ Fine , ”
79826	79834	79817	79817	Vanessa	2268	“ Hey , where are you going ? ”
79835	79842	79776	79776	Emery	1077	“ What are you doing here ? ”
79843	79852	79817	79817	Vanessa	2268	“ I came to see you , baby . ”
79853	79891	79817	79817	Vanessa	2268	“ Colt was supposed to come tomorrow with the nanny . That is what we agreed on . Not that you would come here and bombard my girlfriend at a party that I never invited you to ! ”
79892	79915	79916	79916	she	1077	“ Well , you forgot to mention this fling to me , so I thought I would come spend time with you , ”
79926	79968	79916	79916	she	1077	“ Vanessa , just fucking stop . You know I do n’t want to spend time with you , and you ’ve clearly offended my girlfriend . I love her , and I choose her . Just her . Only her . ”
80018	80043	80011	80011	I	678	“ I think you ’re scum on the bottom of my shoe . I wish you would stop trying to ruin my fucking life . ”
80044	80047	80048	80048	she	1077	“ Jensen , ”
80057	80071	80072	80072	I	678	“ You ’re in my life for one reason , Vanessa . One . ”
80078	80093	80072	80072	I	678	“ Colton . That ’s it . Otherwise , you can go to hell . ”
80171	80179	80163	80163	She	1077	“ I already called for a cab . ”
80180	80188	80189	80189	I	678	“ No . We have the limo . ”
80203	80208	80189	80189	I	678	“ I ca n’t — ”
80209	80242	80163	80163	She	1077	“ Emery , please . I do n’t know what Vanessa said , but she is just trying to get between us . There is nothing between me and Vanessa . Nothing . ”
80243	80251	80252	80252	she	1374	“ She said you have a son , ”
80321	80325	80326	80326	I	678	“ I do , ”
80333	80340	80326	80326	I	678	“ I do have a son . ”
80351	80402	80341	80341	She	1374	“ I can not believe this . You knew that I did n’t know ! That I stay out of your family ’s drama . I gave you a million opportunities to tell me . This whole second - chance business , and you did n’t think I should know ? ”
80403	80427	80341	80341	She	1374	“ It ’s not that , Emery . I was going to tell you . I ’d been planning to tell you tomorrow . ”
80489	80568	80482	80482	Vanessa	2268	“ Well , you blew it . Vanessa is here . She ’s in Lubbock . She found me and cornered me and tried to make me feel worthless . And you know what ? She did n’t succeed . She said some horrible things , but I knew where you and I were , and I was giving us a chance . But then I found out … nope , you were n’t giving us a chance . ”
80598	80603	80593	80593	She	1077	“ You take it . ”
80604	80607	80608	80608	I	678	“ Please , ”
80611	80704	80705	80705	She	1382	“ Please just let me explain . I gave you the opportunity to explain . Give me that same chance . We said we ’d try this together . I want to do this together . After we talk , if you think I ’ve relinquished our second chance , then I ’ll just … drop you off at home . But I wo n’t let you go . I ’ll keep fighting for us because you are the only woman I have ever met who has made me feel like this . ”
80950	80963	80940	80940	She	1382	“ Why did n’t you tell me that you had a son ? ”
80964	81077	80945	80945	she	1382	“ We ’ve only been dating a couple weeks , and I ’m a very private person . I wanted to make sure that this was the real deal . I do n’t introduce people to my son who are going to leave his life . I do n’t think it ’s fair to him . Since he lives in New York with Vanessa , that ’s where his life is . I fly to New York all the time actually . Nearly every single holiday and at least once a month so I do n’t have to uproot his life . I ’m fortunate enough to be able to do that . ”
81078	81090	81091	81091	she	239	“ So … you thought that I would leave your life ? ”
81094	81106	81107	81107	I	678	“ Honestly , until this week , I did n’t know . ”
81127	81181	81122	81122	she	239	“ But I changed my mind this week and wanted to make it right . Colton was supposed to fly in tomorrow with the nanny so that you could meet him . I had no clue that Vanessa was going to show up unannounced or why she decided to come a day early . ”
81182	81193	81194	81194	she	239	“ I think she made it perfectly clear to me , ”
81197	81218	81194	81194	she	239	“ I promise there is nothing going on with me and Vanessa . Our relationship centers entirely around our son . ”
81219	81231	81122	81122	she	239	“ I just hate that I found out from someone else . ”
81232	81241	81242	81242	I	678	“ I was planning on telling you tomorrow , ”
81248	81255	81256	81256	she	239	“ Too little , too late , ”
81259	81296	81297	81297	Her	239	“ Honestly , Emery , I was going to tell you tomorrow . I wanted to get through our date and have an amazing time with you . I even gave you my mother ’s necklace . ”
81315	81324	81309	81309	her	239	“ You gave me your mother ’s necklace ? ”
81325	81380	81381	81381	Emery	1077	“ Yes . Morgan and Sutton have most of her pieces , but she left me a few . She wanted them to go to the woman I loved , and I gave one to you . I ’m sure that ’s why Vanessa freaked the fuck out . She ’s seen it before . ”
81394	81407	81381	81381	Emery	1077	“ And you really did n’t know that she would be here ? ”
81408	81431	81432	81432	I	678	“ No . Fuck , no . I do n’t want her here . She obviously just wanted to fuck with me . ”
81437	81459	81432	81432	I	678	“ You told me that you wanted to do these things together . I was going to give you that opportunity . ”
81460	81474	81475	81475	she	1077	“ I think it ’s sweet that you wanted me to meet him , ”
81479	81527	81528	81528	I	678	“ but I do n’t know why you would n’t tell me before I met him , like … I do n’t know … the day you said you saw Vanessa in New York . You were clearly there to see Colton , not her , right ? ”
81531	81535	81528	81528	I	678	“ I was . ”
81536	81631	81475	81475	she	1077	“ Yet you did n’t tell me . You told me the whole story about Vanessa cheating on you with Marc , how your ex - wife and Cheaterpants horribly ruined your life , but you left out the part where you had a son in the mix of it all . It ’s like I know only half of your story . I got the abridged version of the book . You could have told me at anytime , and you did n’t . Did you think that I would n’t be understanding ? ”
81632	81635	81636	81636	I	678	“ No , ”
81640	81648	81649	81649	She	1387	“ Emery , that ’s not it . ”
81660	81719	81720	81720	Her	1387	“ I think I just need to cope tonight , Jensen . I do n’t fault you for having a son . I love Lilyanne , and now , I understand why you ’re so good with her . But I just fear that you ’ll never really trust me . Maybe you ’ll never trust anyone again . ”
81886	81889	81890	81890	she	1387	“ Kimber , ”
81913	81925	81905	81905	She	1387	“ Hey ! What ’s going on ? Is everything okay ? ”
81936	81960	81961	81961	She	1387	“ Yes . Yes . I ’ll be right there . Do you need anything ? Okay . Do n’t worry about it . ”
81972	81979	81980	81980	I	678	“ She ’s gone into labor ? ”
81983	82001	81980	81980	I	678	“ Yes . I need to get home , so I can drive over to the hospital . ”
82002	82007	81980	81980	I	678	“ What about Lilyanne ? ”
82008	82015	81980	81980	I	678	“ My mom is watching her . ”
82016	82028	81980	81980	I	678	“ Then , I ’ll have the limo drop you off . ”
82029	82032	81980	81980	I	678	“ No — ”
82033	82040	81980	81980	I	678	“ We ’re going straight there , ”
82044	82047	82048	82048	she	1387	“ Okay , ”
82147	82155	82156	82156	she	1387	“ Thank you for dropping me off , ”
82159	82169	82156	82156	she	1387	“ You ’re welcome . Tell Kimber good luck . ”
82170	82174	82175	82175	She	1387	“ I will . ”
82191	82197	82156	82156	she	1387	“ You should keep this . ”
82198	82204	82232	82232	She	1387	“ It was a gift . ”
82205	82231	82232	82232	She	1387	“ It ’s your mother ’s . I only want you to give it to me if this works out . And , right now … ”
82246	82251	82252	82252	She	1387	“ Right now what ? ”
82270	82278	82279	82279	She	1387	“ What does this mean for us ? ”
82284	82306	82279	82279	She	1387	“ I do n’t know . I ca n’t think right now . I just need to be with my sister . ”
82307	82317	82318	82318	I	678	“ I understand . That ’s what ’s important . ”
82327	82339	82318	82318	I	678	“ We ’ll figure the rest of this out another time . ”
82340	82343	82344	82344	she	1387	“ Yeah , ”
82351	82355	82344	82344	she	1387	“ Another time . ”
82679	82682	82683	82683	I	678	“ Fuck , ”
82754	82759	82760	82760	I	678	“ Knock , knock , ”
82787	82790	82791	82791	she	227	“ Hey ! ”
82798	82803	82791	82791	she	227	“ You made it . ”
82804	82809	82791	82791	she	227	“ I made it . ”
82810	82815	82791	82791	she	227	“ Are you okay ? ”
82816	82830	82831	82831	I	678	“ Totally . I ’m so excited to finally meet the little one ! ”
82849	82861	82862	82862	Noah	70	“ Well , it ’s still going to be a while , ”
82865	82889	82862	82862	Noah	70	“ Water has n’t even broken , but she ’s dilated and having contractions at a regular interval . Same as last time . ”
82890	82901	82862	82862	Noah	70	“ I ’m here for an all - nighter then . ”
82902	82923	82924	82924	Kimber	227	“ You look like you came straight from a party . Did you give up your midnight kiss for me ? ”
82964	83002	82953	82953	I	678	“ Meh . Do n’t worry about it . I know you brought a couple of extra outfits . I ’ll just steal your clothes and send Mom back with more when I take over for Lily . ”
83003	83012	83013	83013	Kimber	227	“ You are going to send Mom here ? ”
83027	83042	83017	83017	I	678	“ Now , you admit your true feelings ! She ’s crazy , right ? ”
83043	83060	83074	83074	She	227	“ I do n’t need coaching ! I already have two doctors . Sorry , Noah . ”
83061	83066	83017	83017	I	678	“ No offense taken . ”
83067	83070	83071	83071	Kimber	227	“ Ohhh ! ”
83141	83150	83134	83134	I	678	“ Is it okay if I take this ? ”
83151	83161	83162	83162	Kimber	227	“ We ’re going to be here a while , ”
83165	83169	83162	83162	Kimber	227	“ Go ahead . ”
83184	83188	83162	83162	Kimber	227	“ Hey Heidi . ”
83189	83196	83197	83197	Heidi	208	“ Em ! Where are you ? ”
83200	83221	83162	83162	Kimber	227	“ I found the hottest guy for my New Year ’s kiss , and I want you to meet him . ”
83222	83227	83162	83162	Kimber	227	“ I actually left . ”
83228	83240	83241	83241	Heidi	208	“ Oh , you and Jensen left early for some sex , ”
83251	83271	83244	83244	I	678	“ Actually , no . Kimber went into labor , and Jensen and I got into a huge fight . ”
83272	83278	83279	83279	Heidi	208	“ Kimber went into labor ! ”
83285	83299	83279	83279	Heidi	208	“ Should I leave ? And wait , what fight ? What happened ? ”
83300	83325	83244	83244	I	678	“ No , do n’t leave . We ’re going to be here all night . I can text you when the baby comes . ”
83326	83335	83244	83244	I	678	“ Okay . But what happened with Jensen ? ”
83336	83356	83279	83279	Heidi	208	“ His ex - wife Vanessa showed up at the party and told me that Jensen had a son . ”
83357	83367	83368	83368	Heidi	208	“ Well , of course he has a son , ”
83371	83374	83375	83375	I	678	“ Duh . ”
83380	83407	83375	83375	I	678	“ What do you mean of course he has a son , Heidi ! You knew ? Why would n’t you tell me something like that ? ”
83408	83473	83490	83490	God	2256	“ Jesus Christ , I did n’t know that you did n’t know , Emery . Everyone knows he has a kid . He ’s like this absentee father , who spends all his money on child support and only sees his kid for the holidays . What did you think I meant when I said that he flies to New York every holiday ? ”
83514	83521	83522	83522	I	678	“ Fuck . Really everyone knows ? ”
83525	83553	83522	83522	I	678	“ I mean it ’s not a secret that he had a kid . I swear I thought you knew before you even hooked up with him . ”
83554	83559	83490	83490	God	2256	“ I did n’t . ”
83560	83600	83522	83522	I	678	“ Shit , I ’m sorry . I would have said something , but I figured you knew and thought it was no big deal . It ’s not like this is his first hook up post - child . ”
83601	83604	83605	83605	I	678	“ Yeah , ”
83614	83679	83605	83605	I	678	“ It just … I do n’t think he ’s an absentee father , Heidi . I think he ’s really involved in his son ’s life . He said he ’s very protective of people meeting him . He wants me to meet him , and I do n’t know if I want that . I do n’t think he really trusts me . ”
83680	83694	83695	83695	I	678	“ Maybe he thought you already knew about his son like I did . ”
83700	83715	83695	83695	I	678	“ I do n’t think he did . We would have talked about it . ”
83716	83732	83733	83733	I	678	“ Well , now I feel even shittier . What are you going to do ? ”
83746	83752	83733	83733	I	678	“ I have no idea . ”
83753	83784	83733	83733	I	678	“ Look , when you and Jensen started this , it was supposed to be a fling . It ’s only been a few weeks since you ’ve been together . ”
83785	83802	83803	83803	she	1409	“ Yeah . That ’s true . Why would he share crucial information with a fling ? ”
83833	83861	83862	83862	Heidi	208	“ You ’re not a fling anymore . So , if he wants you to meet his kid , then this is a good sign , Em , ”
83865	83888	83862	83862	Heidi	208	“ Just because you did n’t find out the way that you wanted does n’t mean that he does n’t trust you . ”
83889	83892	83862	83862	Heidi	208	“ Maybe . ”
83893	83928	83862	83862	Heidi	208	“ Okay . Worry about Kimber right now and deal with Jensen tomorrow . Maybe you ’ll have a clear head then . We can talk more if you need to work through it . ”
83929	83934	83862	83862	Heidi	208	“ Thank , Heidi . ”
83935	83941	83862	83862	Heidi	208	“ You ’re the best . ”
83942	83948	83949	83949	We	1410	“ Do n’t forget it . ”
84336	84341	84342	84342	Jennifer	190	“ Hey , Jensen ! ”
84345	84356	84342	84342	Jennifer	190	“ Oh , Colton has been talking about you nonstop ! ”
84357	84367	84368	84368	I	678	“ Hey Jennifer . Good to see you too . ”
84389	84392	84393	84393	Colton	1377	“ Daddy ! ”
84424	84429	84409	84409	I	678	“ Hey , champ , ”
84649	84658	84643	84643	I	678	“ God , I missed you so much , ”
84677	84696	84697	84697	Colton	1377	“ I missed you , too ! Are you coming home with me and Mommy and Nanny Jenn ? ”
84721	84724	84725	84725	I	678	“ Home ? ”
84765	84803	84808	84808	him	1377	“ Yeah , Daddy . Mommy said that we ’re going back to New York today . I want you to come with us . You can meet my new art teacher when I start school again . ”
84863	84875	84876	84876	I	678	“ Going to have to talk to your mom about that , ”
84980	84985	84986	84986	I	678	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
84989	85001	85002	85002	She	2268	“ I thought you were staying for a couple of days . ”
85005	85010	85002	85002	She	2268	“ Changed my mind . ”
85011	85016	85017	85017	Colton	1377	“ Hey , Daddy ! ”
85025	85032	85017	85017	Colton	1377	“ Look at my new drawings . ”
85055	85062	85063	85063	he	1377	“ This one is a pterodactyl , ”
85083	85089	85075	85075	he	1377	“ This is a triceratops . ”
85090	85100	85101	85101	I	678	“ Wow . These are really good , champ . ”
85150	85163	85146	85147	my father	562	“ Are you going to be an artist when you grow up ? ”
85164	85178	85179	85179	I	678	“ No , Daddy , I ’m going to be just like you . ”
85217	85227	85207	85207	God	2256	“ You can be and do whatever you want . ”
85228	85236	85207	85207	God	2256	“ I ’ll fly on planes then ! ”
85237	85242	85207	85207	God	2256	“ Like a pilot ? ”
85243	85255	85256	85256	I	678	“ No . I ’ll run my business in the air . ”
85314	85344	85302	85302	I	678	“ You know , little man , I have someone very special that I want you to meet when you ’re ready . Would you like a new friend ? ”
85345	85348	85349	85349	Colton	1377	“ Yeah ! ”
85352	85366	85349	85349	Colton	1377	“ I love friends . Do you think he ’d color with me ? ”
85367	85370	85371	85371	Vanessa	2268	“ Jensen ! ”
85412	85422	85423	85423	I	678	“ I ’m sure she would color with you , ”
85426	85443	85423	85423	I	678	“ But I ’m going to go talk to your mom for a minute , okay ? ”
85444	85449	85450	85450	I	678	“ Okay , Daddy . ”
85478	85484	85485	85485	She	2268	“ We need to talk . ”
85592	85603	85575	85575	I	678	“ You are not introducing your latest fling to Colton . ”
85604	85624	85575	85575	I	678	“ She ’s my girlfriend , Vanessa . I can , and I will introduce her to my son . ”
85625	85660	85575	85575	I	678	“ Jensen , absolutely not ! You do n’t even know if she ’s going to be in your life past tomorrow ! I wo n’t allow you to disrupt his life like that . ”
85661	85704	85575	85575	I	678	“ Let ’s get to the bottom of this , Vanessa . You do n’t like that someone new is in my life , and you do n’t want it to disrupt your delusions . This has nothing to do with Colt . ”
85705	85727	85728	85728	I	678	“ I do n’t like that you ’re going to introduce him to someone that might leave . That ’s selfish . ”
85739	85780	85781	85781	Vanessa	2268	“ You ’re right , Vanessa . Under any other circumstance , it would be selfish . But it has been four years since we divorced . It ’s not unreasonable for me to meet someone new in that time . ”
85786	85815	85781	85781	Vanessa	2268	“ She ’s not someone new in your life . She ’s another fling . I know you have them all the time . I know the signs . ”
85816	85821	85575	85575	I	678	“ Emery is different . ”
85822	85830	85831	85831	she	2268	“ Really ? How did you meet ? ”
85838	85844	85575	85575	I	678	“ At Sutton ’s wedding . ”
85845	85890	85781	85781	Vanessa	2268	“ Let me get this straight . You met her a month ago , probably banged her that night , did n’t tell her about Colton , and now think you ’re ready to introduce her to him ? I do n’t think so . ”
85891	85939	85575	85575	I	678	“ What I do in my free time is none of your business . Emery is my girlfriend . You may not like that Vanessa , but that ’s not about to change . Good try showing up last night and trying to break us up though . ”
85940	85961	85962	85962	Vanessa	2268	“ I was just trying to tell her the truth . You ’re the one who was a raving jackass , ”
85965	85971	85972	85972	I	678	“ The truth . Right , ”
85976	86004	86005	86005	I	678	“ You were trying to break us up . Even though you were , I am sorry that I spoke to you the way that I did . ”
86036	86061	86031	86031	I	678	“ I did n’t come here to argue with you about last night . I wanted you to understand where I ’m coming from . ”
86062	86073	86074	86074	she	2268	“ Oh , I understand where you ’re coming from , ”
86077	86085	86074	86074	she	2268	“ You ’re thinking with your dick . ”
86086	86129	86130	86130	I	678	“ I ca n’t handle this Vanessa . I ’m tired of arguing . I apologized for how I treated you , but you ca n’t dictate who Colton meets . Emery is in my life , and Colton is my life . ”
86171	86177	86178	86178	Vanessa	2268	“ I ’ll tell Marc , ”
86193	86199	86186	86186	I	678	“ Empty threats , Vanessa . ”
86200	86207	86208	86208	she	2268	“ They ’re not empty threats , ”
86211	86217	86208	86208	she	2268	“ I will tell him . “
86250	86568	86237	86237	I	678	” Then I strode away from her . After kissing Colton good - bye and promising to come back later , I left the hotel and went to go see Emery . We had some catching up to do . Thirty - Two Emery Kimber ’s contractions went on forever with no end in sight . By the next morning , I was worn out and had barely slept . I could n’t even imagine what Kimber was feeling . Luckily , she had finally managed to get some sleep , which was my chance to find the Starbucks downstairs and drink the entire store dry . I let Noah go first though . He ’d been there longer than me , and I knew he needed to eat something even if he claimed he was n’t hungry . As a doctor , he was used to the weird hours , but he needed to be Kimber ’s rock . I ’d take care of him for her . While Noah was gone , my phone pinged . Heidi and I had been texting on and off all night . I swiped my phone and checked the screen , expecting another text from Heidi about the guy she had hit on all last night . But , instead , it was a message from Jensen . Coffee and doughnuts ? It was as if he had read my mind . I wanted those things so bad . My stomach grumbled . But did I want the added struggle of Jensen right now when I was sleep - deprived ? He texted me again . It ’s just coffee and doughnuts . We do n’t have to talk if you do n’t want , but I thought you could use some sustenance . Noah walked back in the door at that time with his own cup of coffee . “
86596	86882	86591	86591	I	678	” I ground my teeth . Of course he had presumed to show up without checking with me first . You ’re already here ? Guilty . Fine . I ’ll be down . But I ’m not a person right now . I left Noah to watch over Kimber and then headed back down to the first floor . My stomach noisily growled again . I could n’t remember what I ’d last had to eat . A candy bar or something in the middle of the night . I ’d been so shaken , and I had n’t even realized it until I ’d gone to find something to help me power through the wee hours of the night . Jensen was waiting in the lobby , holding two coffees and a bag of doughnuts . He looked … beat . He probably had n’t slept all night either . And this was the first time I ’d ever seen him with stubble . Jensen and clean - shaven went hand in hand . But , fuck , it was definitely sexy on him . Like I would n’t mind finding out exactly how he could use that in the bedroom . I was sure it would leave a trail of wonderful marks up my inner thighs . Damn sleep - deprived brain was yelling at me , Sex , sex , sex . I shook my head and tried to put everything back in perspective . I was standing on quicksand . If I kept struggling , I ’d be swallowed up even faster . But , if I stayed still , maybe , just maybe Jensen could pull me back out . “
86886	86901	86902	86902	You	1446	” I asked when I approached him . He grimaced slightly at the comment . “
86907	86908	86902	86902	You	1446	” “
86915	86941	86942	86942	Noah	70	” Jensen passed me the coffee , and we moved to a table inside Starbucks , which was blissfully quiet at such an early hour . “
86956	86957	86942	86942	Noah	70	” “
86962	86987	86942	86942	Noah	70	” I reached into the bag and smiled when I saw an apple fritter and a cinnamon twist inside . My two favorite doughnuts . “
86992	86993	86994	86994	I	678	” “
87002	87050	86994	86994	I	678	” I nodded . For the first time ever , there was awkwardness between us . We had one foot in the water and one foot on solid ground . Not knowing where we stood or what would come next seemed to be killing both of us . “
87063	87071	87053	87053	I	678	” Jensen said , breaking the silence . “
87081	87085	87078	87078	I	678	” I mumbled . “
87111	87112	87099	87099	I	678	” “
87116	87117	87118	87118	Me	678	” “
87126	87154	87118	87118	Me	678	” he clarified . His eyes darted up to mine , and I could see the hours of anguish and self - deprecation that radiated from him . “
87186	87200	87201	87201	I	678	” I nodded , having found out firsthand the truth of that statement . “
87221	87247	87248	87248	Colton	1377	” He sighed and glanced away , as if he did n’t want to continue , as if the next words would rip through him . “
87254	87288	87248	87248	Colton	1377	” I opened my mouth , stuttered incoherently , and then closed it again . I shook my head in confusion , trying to understand how his own son could n’t be his . “
87294	87295	87296	87296	I	678	” “
87305	87323	87299	87299	Colt	187	” he said so calmly that I knew it must have been killing him to admit it . “
87346	87347	87350	87350	Marc	1377	” “
87352	87353	87356	87356	Marc	1377	” “
87358	87363	87356	87356	Marc	1377	” he growled low . “
87400	87437	87386	87387	my son	1377	” My heart ached for him . How could he possibly live with the fact that his son was n’t really his ? How had he kept that secret locked up for all of these years ? “
87441	87467	87468	87468	Vanessa	2268	” I asked , suddenly desperate for him to tell me the story . To finally have an explanation for why he was so guarded . “
87554	87573	87547	87547	I	678	” He shrugged , as if he had played this over and over again in his head before . “
87579	87580	87547	87547	I	678	” “
87618	87619	87629	87629	she	2268	” “
87638	87644	87629	87629	she	2268	” I said , furious . “
87649	87665	87646	87647	a bitch	1736	” Jensen looked off in the distance , the memory hitting him fresh once more . “
87740	87756	87724	87724	he	2183	” He took a long sip of his coffee and leaned back in his chair . “
87761	87765	87724	87724	he	2183	” I grumbled . “
87774	87775	87776	87776	I	678	” “
87826	87847	87848	87848	Marc	1377	” I smiled at that statement . I loved the thought that Jensen had never treated his son any differently . “
87868	87869	87860	87860	We	1469	” “
87876	87877	87860	87860	We	1469	” “
87880	87881	87860	87860	We	1469	” “
87892	87896	87897	87897	I	678	” I gasped . “
87978	87988	87989	87989	We	1472	” He set his cup down and sighed heavily . “
88027	88028	88013	88013	she	2268	” “
88035	88036	88029	88029	I	678	” “
88070	88082	88059	88059	I	678	” Jensen clenched and unclenched his fist , remembering the bloodlust . “
88112	88113	88100	88100	Vanessa	2268	” “
88124	88281	88122	88122	Jensen	2210	” And I meant every word . How could I possibly blame him for what happened ? Vanessa and Marc were to blame . They had taken everything from him . Even his son . A son he had raised for two years , thinking Colt was his . No wonder he never told anyone . How could he ear the shame ? The sense of loss ? I reached out and took his hand . He glanced up at me with surprise in his dark eyes . He must have thought that I would turn on him , like everyone else had in his life . He deflated before my eyes . As if he had been so pent - up over the whole thing that finally telling someone else the truth had drained him . He tightened his fingers around my hand , and we stayed like that for a few minutes in silence . “
88290	88298	88122	88122	Jensen	2210	” he finally said , drawing back . “
88402	88419	88391	88392	my mother	239	” He pulled the diamond necklace out of his pocket and let it dangle between us . “
88425	88426	88427	88427	Jensen	2210	” “
88429	88446	88427	88427	Jensen	2210	” I whispered . He took my hand and gently laid the necklace into my palm . “
88465	88617	88452	88452	I	678	” This was a lot to absorb . He wanted to prove to me that he trusted me . That he could trust . It did n’t make up for what we had gone through , but it was a start . I closed my hand around the necklace . He smiled brilliantly , the hours of anxiety from the past day falling off of his shoulder . He leaned forward and brushed his lips to my forehead . Slowly , I let a smile stretch across my face as I put the necklace back around my neck and tucked it under my shirt . I ’d given him hope … and now , I had some , too . He stood up to leave and give me space when his phone started ringing . He gave me a sheepish look and then glanced at the screen . His face paled . “
88622	88636	88637	88637	Marc	1377	” I asked . I did not like that look on his face . “
88639	88640	88643	88643	he	1377	” “
88647	88684	88643	88643	he	1377	” Jensen shook his head as if he did n’t know , but I could see on his face that he did . And it was bad . He sank back into his chair and answered . “
88687	88704	88705	88705	You	1377	” Marc ’s response was so loud that I could hear it through the other line . “
88711	88712	88705	88705	You	1377	” “
88720	88737	88718	88718	Marc	1377	” Marc responded , but I could n’t hear what he said , then Jensen said , “
88746	88747	88748	88748	I	678	” “
88755	88760	88748	88748	I	678	” Marc shouted back . “
88774	88775	88768	88768	Marc	1377	” “
88810	88811	88812	88812	Marc	1377	” “
88822	88823	88824	88824	He	1377	” “
88830	88834	88824	88824	He	1377	” Marc screamed . “
88840	88850	88835	88835	I	678	” Jensen said , raising his voice in fury . “
88858	88859	88860	88860	Colton	1377	” “
88907	88908	88900	88900	I	678	” “
88919	88920	88900	88900	I	678	” “
88927	88939	88923	88923	I	678	” Jensen slammed his phone down on the table and fumed . “
88942	88977	88923	88923	I	678	” he muttered . He put both of his hands into his hair and pulled . His teeth were gritted . His body tense . He looked as if he were ready to erupt . “
88983	89000	89001	89001	Vanessa	2268	” I asked softly , though I feared I already knew the answer from that conversation . “
89005	89027	89001	89001	Vanessa	2268	” My heart stopped beating for a split second . I could n’t believe that Vanessa would go to such extremes . “
89121	89122	89101	89101	she	2268	” “
89136	89137	89101	89101	she	2268	” “
89160	89181	89182	89182	I	678	” he told me . But he sounded like he ’d been hit by a truck when he said it . “
89230	89231	89234	89234	Jensen	2210	” “
89236	89246	89234	89234	Jensen	2210	” I said , my heart breaking for him . “
89258	89270	89234	89234	Jensen	2210	” It took him a full minute before he could respond , “
89273	89274	89234	89234	Jensen	2210	” “
89282	89283	89284	89284	I	678	” “
89289	89290	89291	89291	You	2210	” “
89294	89295	89296	89296	I	678	” “
89345	89346	89347	89347	Jensen	2210	” “
89349	89358	89347	89347	Jensen	2210	” I whispered , reaching out for him , “
89369	89370	89347	89347	Jensen	2210	” “
89388	89389	89390	89391	The baby	1017	” “
89415	89416	89410	89410	I	678	” “
89421	89426	89417	89417	I	678	” he told me . “
89434	89669	89674	89674	everyone	211	” Thirty - Three Emery I stayed at the hospital the rest of the afternoon at Jensen ’s insistence . I wanted to be there for when the baby was delivered , and I know that he had to deal with his lawyers in the meantime . Later that day , I finally got to hold my new niece in my arms . She was as light as a feather and adorable to boot . Little Bethany Ilsa Thompson came in at seven pounds and three ounces and nineteen inches . She slept , swaddled up to her chin , with her eyes firmly shut , and everyone in the room was huddled around her . I was n’t ready to relinquish her . I knew I was going to spoil her to death as she got older . But I also knew that her mom and dad and older sister wanted a turn . Not to mention , her grandmother kept trying to take her out of everyone ’s arms . But it did n’t matter . This was perfect . Forget the last couple of weeks of madness in my life . Bethany was too perfect for drama . Reluctantly , I handed her back to Kimber , who was setting Lilyanne up to hold her . A nurse knocked on the door just as we got Bethany into Lily ’s arms . “
89676	89684	89674	89674	everyone	211	” she said with a bright smile . “
89719	89739	89740	89740	I	678	” Lilyanne looked like she was about to cry , but she nodded and handed Bethany to the nurse . “
89754	89771	89751	89752	big sister	1498	” Lily beamed at that . She was loving the idea of being a big sister . “
89780	89787	89751	89752	big sister	1498	” Kimber said with a sigh . “
89794	89795	89751	89752	big sister	1498	” “
89802	89806	89808	89809	a kidder	1499	” I joked . “
89811	89812	89808	89809	a kidder	1499	” “
89835	89836	89827	89827	I	678	” “
89848	89852	89841	89841	We	1500	” Kimber said . “
89859	89863	89841	89841	We	1500	” I laughed . “
89877	89878	89870	89870	her	193	” “
89881	90103	89870	89870	her	193	” I smiled at Kimber as she grabbed some fresh clothes to take into the bathroom . I knew she ’d be in there for a long time after the night she ’d endured . Hours and hours of labor with no respite . It had been tough , but I knew she thought it was worth the effort . We all did . I was excited to see Jensen again . I hated what was happening to him because of Vanessa . After we had just sat down for our big talk at that . I appreciated that he had recognized that he could n’t trust and that he was working to fix it . I still wanted that man who had gone out of his way to drive me through Christmas lights , who could n’t resist asking me out — in church , no less — and who had hired someone to pack up my apartment so we could spend the afternoon together . But I wanted him with all his skeletons out of the closet and our pasts firmly in the past . Hopefully , after this week , that would be the case . I left the hospital and went straight to Jensen ’s place . The door was unlocked , and I entered the house . “
90106	90191	90192	90192	Emery	208	” I called into the foyer . Jensen appeared then at the top of the stairs in dark - wash jeans and a plain T - shirt . His muscles rippled from the tightly fitted shirt , and I practically salivated at the sight of him . I knew I was here to be emotional support and help him make it through the next twelve hours , but my mind apparently had other plans . He smiled , and those dimples did me in . “
90194	90203	90192	90192	Emery	208	” he said with a deeply relieved sigh . “
90206	90213	90192	90192	Emery	208	” I said climbing the stairs . “
90224	90225	90214	90214	We	1501	” “
90243	90244	90245	90246	Bethany Isla	239	” “
90277	90281	90282	90282	She	1502	” Jensen grinned . “
90297	90449	90287	90287	Her	1502	” I grinned and willed my mind to get myself under control . It had been too long since we slept together . And , now that I could see him clearly again , all I wanted to do was jump his bones . Except that I knew he needed something more than sex tonight . Sex might make him forget , but it would n’t heal anything . When I came eye - to - eye with him , I noticed how ragged he looked . Still sexy as hell but beaten down . Vanessa was trying to undo him . And , while he stood tall and had the presence of the brilliant CEO that he was , I knew him well enough to know that he was lost and crumbling into that dark place in his chest . A place from which I feared he would not return . “
90456	90473	90287	90287	Her	1502	” I asked . He cocked his head to the side and stared off into space . “
90495	90592	90593	90593	You	1507	” I sighed . I was sure that , in his head , that was true . But I also knew that his body would start to shut down , and he had to be cognizant tomorrow . To be able to face Marc and not lose control again around him , not like the time he ’d beaten his face in after Vanessa had told him about the affair . He needed to be sharp . Wordlessly , I took his hand . He stared down at it with a mixture of awe and concern . “
90601	90602	90593	90593	You	1507	” “
90606	90621	90593	90593	You	1507	” I asked , bringing his hand up to my lips and kissing it . “
90625	90626	90593	90593	You	1507	” “
90631	90632	90629	90629	I	678	” “
90635	90636	90637	90637	You	1507	” “
90641	90642	90637	90637	You	1507	” “
90647	90648	90649	90649	You	1507	” “
90653	90663	90651	90651	me	678	” I whispered , drawing him closer to me . “
90670	90671	90666	90666	I	678	” “
90674	90692	90694	90694	I	678	” he said , his voice deep and guttural . A feral sound that bordered on hysteria . “
90700	90701	90694	90694	I	678	” “
90705	90903	90694	90694	I	678	” he asked . I could see in his eyes that he thought I meant everything sexual . A thought that had obviously crossed my mind . I wanted that to make him feel better , but I knew he needed so much more . I held on to his hand and pulled him down the hallway without another word . Our relationship might have been a bumpy ride . We had secrets . We ’d traded lies . We ’d tried to find ways to fit the other into the mess that we ’d been living in . But , at the end of the day , I knew Jensen Wright . I ’d chosen him , and I ’d be here for him through the worst of it . When we entered his bedroom , I languidly tugged his shirt over his head . Lust swirled in his eyes as I did it , and I knew , if I gave in , neither of us would sleep ever again . We ’d stay in bed all night . Lost in our own desires . He reached for my shirt , but I stopped him . “
90913	91091	91092	91092	You	1508	” I warned him . He fumed but dropped his hands . I flicked the button on his jeans , dragged them down his legs , and watched as he kicked them off , leaving him in his tight boxer briefs . He was rock hard for me , and it took everything in my power not to lick my lips . I directed him into bed , and he went willingly . What man would n’t ? Then , I stripped out of my jeans and T - shirt . Jensen looked ready to launch himself across the room when he saw the black lace set I ’d been wearing for him on New Year ’s Eve . But I hastily threw on his T - shirt , which was way too big for me . Then , I turned out all the lights and crawled into bed . He reached for me as soon as I was under the covers , pressing his dick firmly against my ass and squeezing me tight to his chest . “
91097	91104	91092	91092	You	1508	” he breathed into my neck . “
91112	91116	91092	91092	You	1508	” I whispered . “
91121	91135	91136	91136	You	1508	” He thrust against my ass , and I squeezed my legs together . “
91141	91142	91136	91136	You	1508	” “
91156	91231	91136	91136	You	1508	” he asked , as if I were insane . With effort , I turned to face him and saw his dark eyes filled with lust . I wanted this . He wanted this . But I did n’t trust myself to stop . With Jensen Wright , there were only two speeds — more and , God , more . I gently placed my hand on his chest and slightly pushed him away . “
91261	91262	91250	91250	I	678	” “
91270	91324	91250	91250	I	678	” he groaned . He slid his hand up and down my side , fisting his shirt and exposing my stomach and lace thong . His hand snagged on the material , and he flicked it with his thumb . It snapped against my skin , causing my whole body to clench up . “
91327	91373	91250	91250	I	678	” I moaned . My walls were weakening . He pushed into the space I ’d put between us and ran the stubble of his chin across my shoulder and up my neck . His voice rasped into my earlobe as he tugged on it . “
91390	91391	91382	91382	I	678	” “
91394	91578	91579	91579	Jensen	2210	” I whispered . He took that as a yes and slipped the rest of my clothes off of me with aching slowness . First , the T - shirt went over my head . Then , he snapped my bra off and tossed it off the bed . Finally , he dragged my thong down my knees and over my feet . I shivered the whole way down . He removed his own boxer briefs next with much less care , and just when I thought he was going to give me what I wanted , he flipped me over on top of him . His dick nudged at my wet opening , and it took everything in me not to rock back onto him . I eased down , savoring the feel of him . Just the head … just the tip … just an inch … maybe two . My body tightened around him , wanting to feel him fill me up . But then he stopped me and pulled me off of his dick . I groaned with dissatisfaction . “
91581	91582	91579	91579	Jensen	2210	” “
91588	91599	91579	91579	Jensen	2210	” he demanded . My eyes found his in shock . “
91602	91603	91604	91604	I	678	” “
91621	91941	91615	91615	I	678	” I hesitantly edged forward until my pussy was directly over his lips . Then , he clamped his hands down on my ass cheeks and ground his face up into my body . I cried out as he ravaged me from below . My hands jerked out and landed on the headboard , bracing myself as my body abandoned my control . He licked and sucked and got the taste of me on more than just his tongue . My whole body convulsed , and I tried to pull up from his incredible assault , but he was n’t having it . He tightened his grip on me and brought my pussy closer to him . I writhed in ecstasy until I exploded from the most amazing orgasm . Then , I sat there , trembling , with him still licking me past the point of my release … prolonging my pleasure . When I was finally sated , he flipped me backward and fell on top of me . I was so wet , he slid into me with ease . I arched my back off the bed , purring like a kitten as he took me balls deep . Nothing else mattered in that moment . All my fears and worries stripped away . There was only here and now . There was only sex and lust and passion . We could ride the wave . We could survive the current . We could fucking rein it in with a lasso and make it our own . He drove into me with relentless force . Meeting him stroke for stroke and falling into oblivion for the second time , I actually thought I might pass out from pure pleasure . He followed right after me , and his heavy weight collapsing over me was the best feeling in the world . He nipped at my neck . “
91952	91971	91972	91972	Me	678	” I laughed , low and raspy . I ’d used my vocal cords properly as I came . “
91976	92152	92153	92153	Vanessa	2268	” We did n’t have to say anything else . Words were beyond us at this point . We had a world to face tomorrow , but for tonight , he was mine , and I was his . Thirty - Four Jensen When I finally woke up , it felt like I ’d slept for days . It had been so long since I got a full night sleep and days since I slept at all , period , I was shocked that I had even been functioning . The only good sleep I ever got anymore was when Emery was in my arms . Like she was right at this moment — naked and completely satisfied . We probably should have gone to sleep like she had said last night . But , once she ’d stripped me down and put me in bed , I had known there was no way that was happening . I ’d been thinking about this girl nonstop — up until Marc had uttered those unbelievable words . “
92157	92538	92153	92153	Vanessa	2268	” I still could n’t believe she ’d done it . She had been hanging it over my head for so long that I ’d become complacent to the threat . I never thought she ’d actually break down and do it . Then again … it had taken her years to admit to cheating on me with Marc . Maybe I should n’t have been surprised that it ’d taken her this long to tell him the truth . The girl was a snake . I did n’t know how I had never seen it all those years we had been together . Or maybe New York had poisoned her . Maybe she had n’t actually been cut out for the big city and modeling , and her way of coping had been to become worse than the city itself . But these were just excuses . They did n’t justify her behavior . Lots of people moved to New York and did n’t cheat on their husbands … didn’t have a child with someone else . I closed my eyes , wishing that I could disappear back into last night . Feel Emery ’s warm body against mine and pretend not to have a care in the world . But reality was crashing back down . I had to face Marc and Vanessa today . I had to claim my son . Last night had been a dream , but it was time to wake up . Kissing Emery ’s forehead , I washed last night ’s events off of my body and changed into a crisp black Tom Ford suit . Everything about the ensemble screamed power and money . Both things I wanted to exert to the two people who had ruined my life . Marc had stolen my wife . He was n’t going to steal my son , too . It was n’t enough that I had bought out his company and was in the process of selling it off for parts like a used car . I would bury him before letting him have access to Colton . My lawyers had been working on a case against Vanessa since the day I left New York . We could handle her if need be . “
92544	92556	92539	92539	You	1511	” Emery mumbled from the bed when I appeared once more . “
92573	92574	92566	92566	You	1511	” “
92577	92590	92566	92566	You	1511	” she said , letting the sheet slip down her naked body . “
92606	92628	92629	92629	I	678	” She blushed a soft pink that I adored . After all our sex , she still blushed at my comments . “
92642	92643	92640	92640	Marc	1377	” “
92653	92671	92647	92647	He	1377	” I said with a twitch in my lips . Oh , how the mighty have fallen . “
92677	92681	92647	92647	He	1377	” she joked . “
92699	92700	92647	92647	He	1377	” “
92714	92718	92647	92647	He	1377	” I nodded . “
92758	92765	92747	92747	I	678	” She smiled lazily at me . “
92772	92888	92768	92768	I	678	” It was hours before I would get to see that smile again . Work was torture . I had n’t wanted to worry her , but the hours waiting , even when I was busy , did n’t help . She dampened the pain . Only her . By the time I finally got to pick her up again , it was like a balm . I did n’t show nerves or stress . Only a few people — primarily Morgan — even noticed , but Emery seemed to have a radar for it . She put her hand on mine as soon as she sat down in the Mercedes and kissed my cheek . “
92896	92903	92889	92889	I	678	” she said with such candor . “
92910	92925	92926	92926	They	387	” I asked as I pulled away from the hospital and drove across town . “
92940	92941	92942	92942	I	678	” “
92945	92946	92947	92947	They	387	” “
92968	92969	92970	92970	I	678	” “
92977	93034	93035	93035	We	387	” I said softly . I rarely talked about what it had been like in those first two years with Colton . The facade that Vanessa had created was so great that , when she took it all away , even the happy memories were tainted with her lies . Emery squeezed my hand and nodded . “
93041	93042	93043	93043	You	387	” “
93050	93246	93047	93047	We	387	” I said , going back to that cold , detached place that fought my battles and won my wars . I would damn sure win this one . We parked out front of the lawyer ’s office . I recognized Vanessa ’s father ’s car , which meant she must have left Colton with him for this meeting . Good . I did n’t want Colton anywhere near this . It was going to get ugly . I did n’t know what Marc was driving , but I did n’t see anything pretentious enough for him . Emery hurried around to the other side of the car and took my hand . She held it , as if we were a united front against the enemy . And I could n’t have been more thankful to have her there . She made me a better man . And , with her , I had the added benefit of putting Vanessa on edge . As expected , when we walked into the lobby , Vanessa whipped around and glared at our entwined fingers . Her lawyer was talking on a cell phone in a corner . “
93254	93258	93259	93259	She	1516	” she spat . “
93265	93389	93259	93259	She	1516	” I shrugged and gave her a cool smile . No reason to give in to her antics . We were only here because of her bullshit . We would end it here , too . We waited another five minutes in tense silence before Marc finally showed . I was surprised Abigail was n’t with him . She went everywhere with him to temper his anger . I wondered if he ’d even told her what was happening before disappearing . Instead , he only had his lawyer present with him . I should n’t be surprised that he ’d gotten someone on his own to represent his interests instead of relying on Vanessa . Marc ’s eyes landed on me first . “
93394	93398	93390	93390	You	1518	” Marc spat . “
93426	93427	93428	93428	We	1520	” “
93432	93453	93454	93454	I	678	” I said . Marc stalked right over to me and got in my face . Emery squeezed my hand . “
93463	93464	93454	93454	I	678	” “
93469	93533	93465	93465	You	1518	” I told him . And fail . Just then , the door to the lawyer ’s office opened , and my lawyer , Jake McCarty , appeared . He was a short , stocky man , who had been my father ’s lawyer before me . He knew his shit , and he knew how to get his clients what they wanted . “
93541	93564	93566	93566	she	1521	” We moved into a large conference room with Marc and Vanessa on one side and me and Emery on the other . “
93574	93578	93579	93579	She	1521	” Vanessa asked . “
93585	93586	93587	93587	She	1521	” “
93590	93596	93597	93597	She	1521	” I told her crisply . “
93603	93612	93597	93597	She	1521	” Jake said with a nod at Emery . “
93644	93645	93635	93635	I	678	” “
93649	93653	93654	93654	We	1523	” Vanessa hissed . “
93658	93663	93654	93654	We	1523	” I said calmly . “
93779	93827	93830	93830	I	678	” The other lawyers agreed with the terms even though Marc looked ready to explode that he had come all this way and had no access to Colton . I was pleased with that even though I was pissed that I could n’t see my own son . “
93857	93872	93843	93846	Colton ’s biological father	1527	” he said , passing paperwork to both me , Marc , and Vanessa , “
93879	93880	93843	93846	Colton ’s biological father	1527	” “
93891	93897	93898	93898	He	1527	” Marc ’s lawyer said . “
93928	93929	93924	93924	Colton	1377	” “
93947	93952	93937	93937	he	1377	” Jake said dryly . “
93971	93990	93965	93965	he	1377	” Marc ’s lawyer glanced at Marc , as if to say , Want to go to bat ? “
94042	94066	94030	94030	she	196	” Vanessa gasped , as if Marc ’s lawyer had slapped her . Either way , she was the villain . I approved . “
94152	94153	94144	94144	he	1377	” “
94159	94169	94154	94154	I	678	” Marc said , cutting his own lawyer off . “
94194	94215	94186	94186	we	1532	” Marc and Vanessa glared at me before filing out of the room and leaving the three of us alone . “
94223	94235	94186	94186	we	1532	” I told Jake . He shook my hand and nodded . “
94254	94255	94243	94243	Jensen	2210	” “
94258	94262	94265	94266	your son	1536	” I countered . “
94268	94345	94346	94346	I	678	” I could n’t deny that I ’d thought about it . I wanted to steal Colton away and never have anyone interfere in our lives again . But I would n’t . I would be a mess and in a total panic if Vanessa ever did such a thing . I could never do that to her , no matter what she had done to me . And I could never hurt Colton like that . “
94350	94351	94346	94346	I	678	” “
94418	94426	94415	94416	Marc Tarman	1377	” Jake said with a measured look . “
94429	94430	94431	94431	I	678	” “
94444	94461	94437	94437	he	1377	” I said , thinking about how he had n’t pressed charges all those years ago . “
94468	94492	94464	94464	he	1377	” Jake said flatly . Emery ’s hand went into mine again . I had n’t realized I ’d been clenching my fists . “
94500	94518	94493	94493	I	678	” she said . My solid rock . God , I believed her . Thirty - Five Emery “
94528	94540	94523	94523	I	678	” I said as we left the lawyer ’s office behind . “
94544	94548	94523	94523	I	678	” Jensen asked . “
94561	94562	94523	94523	I	678	” “
94567	94568	94523	94523	I	678	” “
94580	94581	94582	94582	You	1377	” “
94603	94604	94599	94599	I	678	” “
94607	94633	94599	94599	I	678	” That had been bugging me from the start . He had just let that stand without confirmation . It would have driven me crazy . “
94718	94747	94703	94703	Vanessa	2268	“ That makes sense . You did n’t want her to take him away . So , you never gave her the proof she needed to do it . ”
94748	94800	94801	94801	My	678	“ Right , but the other reason is because I did n’t need a paternity test to tell me that Colton is my son . I did n’t need the confirmation . Colton is my son . Regardless of biology or anything else . He ’s mine . I love him . ”
94812	94851	94801	94801	My	678	“ I did n’t need proof when I held him in my arms every day and watched him grow up . I had all the proof I needed when he kissed me good night and called me Daddy . ”
94889	94899	94874	94874	He	678	“ You ’re a good dad , Jensen Wright . ”
94900	94911	94912	94912	I	678	“ It is what I have always endeavored to be . ”
94920	94936	94937	94937	He	2210	“ Do n’t ever let them take that away from you . No matter what . ”
94944	94971	94937	94937	He	2210	“ If they take my son from me , I will no longer be a good person . There ’ll be little hope for anything else . ”
95173	95176	95177	95177	I	678	“ Painless ? ”
95183	95192	95177	95177	I	678	“ Yeah . Now , the waiting begins . ”
95193	95201	95177	95177	I	678	“ I have an idea about that . ”
95202	95205	95206	95206	he	2210	“ Hmm ? ”
95211	95234	95206	95206	he	2210	“ I thought we might disappear for a bit . Not too long but just to get your mind off of things . ”
95235	95244	95177	95177	I	678	“ Are you really sure I should leave ? ”
95245	95259	95177	95177	I	678	“ I think it would be good . Plus , your lawyer agrees . ”
95260	95281	95282	95282	he	2210	“ Yeah , but what if Vanessa does something crazy or Marc interferes ? What if I ’m not here ? ”
95285	95295	95296	95296	He	2210	“ We wo n’t go far . I promise . ”
95304	95308	95296	95296	He	2210	“ All right . ”
95309	95325	95296	95296	He	2210	“ You could come meet Bethany when I stop by my place to get clothes . ”
95326	95332	95333	95333	Jensen	2210	“ I ’d like that . ”
95402	95407	95408	95408	I	678	“ Hey , cutie , ”
95417	95424	95425	95425	Heidi	208	“ About time you showed up ! ”
95431	95436	95425	95425	Heidi	208	“ Hey , Jensen . ”
95437	95440	95441	95441	he	2210	“ Heidi , ”
95537	95543	95544	95544	I	678	“ She ’s so cute , ”
95550	95555	95556	95556	Kimber	208	“ Is n’t she ? ”
95562	95575	95556	95556	Kimber	208	“ Noah ’s at work , and Lily is upstairs , napping . ”
95576	95579	95580	95580	I	678	“ Beautiful , ”
95604	95612	95597	95597	she	239	“ Do you want to hold her ? ”
95613	95620	95597	95597	she	239	“ If that ’s all right ? ”
95621	95625	95626	95626	Kimber	208	“ Of course , ”
95629	95636	95637	95637	He	2210	“ You ’re great with Lilyanne . ”
95687	95695	95683	95684	a baby	302	“ I ’m going to go pack . ”
95696	95699	95700	95700	Kimber	208	“ Pack ? ”
95703	95731	95700	95700	Kimber	208	“ I thought y’ all might like some space with Bethany home and all . I ’m going to go stay with Jensen for a few days . ”
95732	95739	95740	95740	Kimber	208	“ That ’s sweet , Em , ”
95743	95755	95740	95740	Kimber	208	“ but not necessary . I do n’t mind you staying . ”
95756	95782	95783	95783	Heidi	208	“ I know , but I do n’t want to be in the way when you want to bond . I ’ll be right back . ”
95801	95818	95793	95793	I	678	“ Your shit is still in boxes from Austin . Are you ever going to unpack ? ”
95819	95828	95829	95829	I	678	“ Not until I move in with you , ”
95836	95848	95829	95829	I	678	“ Seriously ? You think I want you in my apartment ? ”
95849	95859	95793	95793	I	678	“ Of course you do . I ’m awesome . ”
95860	95887	95888	95888	I	678	“ Move in whenever you want , whore . But give me the deets on you and Jensen . Fighting . Not fighting . What gives ? ”
95891	95918	95888	95888	I	678	“ Things were put into perspective . He went out on a limb for me , and I want to trust him and see this through . ”
95919	95931	95829	95829	I	678	“ Way to vaguebook . Give me the down and dirty . ”
95932	95937	95938	95938	I	678	“ I ca n’t , ”
95945	96000	96001	96001	Heidi	208	“ I love you — you know that — but this is n’t my secret to tell . Until Jensen is ready to tell it , I do n’t want to mess up his trust . We ’re kind of on new ground here … and I like him too much to lose that . ”
96007	96038	96001	96001	Heidi	208	“ That ’s fair . I ’m not trying to pry . Okay , I am . But I do n’t want to fuck up your relationship . Everything okay ? ”
96039	96050	95829	95829	I	678	“ Honestly … we’ll find out in a few days . ”
96051	96055	96001	96001	Heidi	208	“ Seems grim . ”
96056	96062	96001	96001	Heidi	208	“ You ’ve no idea . ”
96063	96116	95829	95829	I	678	“ Okay , okay . Well , fill me in when you can , and let ’s set up a plan for you to actually move in . You ’d better not be that girl who moves in with her bestie and then sleeps at her boyfriend ’s house the whole time . ”
96117	96130	96131	96131	Heidi	208	“ You know I ’ve got time for you in my bed . ”
96134	96146	96131	96131	Heidi	208	“ I love you . So , where are you going ? ”
96147	96177	95829	95829	I	678	“ Surprise . Will you check on Kimber the next couple of days ? I really do n’t want to smother them , but I ’ll miss my niece . ”
96178	96183	96184	96184	I	678	“ You know it . ”
96249	96256	96237	96237	he	2210	“ She ’s gorgeous , Kimber , ”
96264	96270	96257	96257	Jensen	2210	“ Congratulations to you both . ”
96271	96275	96276	96276	she	208	“ Thank you , ”
96285	96303	96304	96304	I	678	“ I ’ll see you in a couple of days . Call me if you need me , ”
96309	96312	96313	96313	Kimber	208	“ Okay , ”
96321	96325	96326	96326	Jensen	2210	“ Love you . ”
96335	96348	96326	96326	Jensen	2210	“ You going to fill me in on where we ’re going ? ”
96358	96364	96349	96349	I	678	“ You have n’t guessed ? ”
96365	96370	96349	96349	I	678	“ Coming up blank . ”
96371	96378	96379	96379	He	2210	“ Back to our first date . ”
96396	96400	96401	96401	Jensen	2210	“ The cabin . ”
96567	96574	96575	96575	Jensen	2210	“ Maybe we should go back , ”
96579	96588	96589	96589	I	678	“ Look , I know you ’re worried , ”
96608	96652	96653	96653	He	2210	“ I ’m worried , too . But you need to get your mind off of things just until we know the test results . If not , all you ’ll do is worry yourself to death … and probably do something stupid . ”
96667	96673	96662	96662	His	2210	“ You ’re probably right . ”
96674	96680	96681	96681	His	2210	“ I ’m definitely right . ”
96688	96703	96681	96681	His	2210	“ And how exactly are you going to get my mind off of things ? ”
96704	96711	96662	96662	His	2210	“ I had a few ideas . ”
96712	96727	96728	96728	I	678	“ Does the first start with you stripping in front of the fire again ? ”
96731	96739	96740	96740	His	2210	“ That ’s like the third idea . ”
96747	96756	96740	96740	His	2210	“ We should move it up the list . ”
96801	96806	96807	96807	he	2210	“ Help me forget , ”
97039	97044	97045	97045	I	678	“ I love you , ”
97069	97076	97053	97053	he	2210	“ I will always love you . ”
97315	97321	97322	97322	Jensen	2210	“ How are you doing ? ”
97329	97334	97322	97322	Jensen	2210	“ Never been better . ”
97335	97338	97339	97339	he	2210	“ Mmm , ”
97342	97350	97351	97351	I	678	“ I think I want to teach , ”
97358	97368	97351	97351	I	678	“ I bet you ’d be amazing at it . ”
97369	97394	97322	97322	Jensen	2210	“ My mother , of all people , suggested I do it , and now , I think it sounds like the right choice . ”
97395	97403	97351	97351	I	678	“ Is that what you want then ? ”
97404	97452	97351	97351	I	678	“ It was the only thing that really made me happy in grad school . I thought it would get easier . All the research and papers and such , but it was the classroom that made me happy . I just … thought that was normal . ”
97453	97461	97462	97462	he	2210	“ Maybe it was telling you something , ”
97473	97478	97479	97479	I	678	“ Maybe it was , ”
97482	97516	97479	97479	I	678	“ I ’ve never really told anyone that . It was anathema to what everyone thought I should be focusing on in grad school . No one talked about loving the teaching side . ”
97517	97534	97535	97535	I	678	“ Well , I think you should stop caring what they think and follow your heart . ”
97557	97563	97551	97552	Jensen Wright	2210	“ I think I have . ”
97564	97570	97571	97571	he	2210	“ You are my heart , ”
97588	97669	97574	97574	He	2210	“ And I ca n’t thank you enough for being here right now through all of this . I know that things have n’t been easy . You could have left at anytime . Yet you are here with me through the hardest moment of my life . No matter what happens , Emery , when I walk out on the other side of this … I want you to be with me . I want you to be mine . ”
97681	97685	97670	97670	I	678	“ I am . ”
97827	97832	97833	97833	Jake	195	“ Tests are in , ”
97836	97839	97833	97833	Jake	195	“ Showtime . ”
97840	97848	97833	97833	Jake	195	“ Do you know what they say ? ”
97849	97870	97871	97871	I	678	“ They ’re sealed . We ’ll find out at the same time as everyone else . But be prepared . ”
97880	97885	97886	97886	Emery	128	“ Time to go . ”
97909	97913	97894	97894	Her	1580	“ Right now ? ”
97914	97920	97894	97894	Her	1580	“ Test results are in . ”
97921	97924	97925	97925	she	1580	“ Fuck , ”
97931	97936	97925	97925	she	1580	“ Let ’s go . ”
97937	97966	97967	97967	She	1580	“ We have to get everyone together at once before we can go through the sealed paperwork . But we should get over there as soon as possible . ”
98280	98283	98284	98284	Vanessa	2268	“ What ? ”
98287	98290	98291	98291	I	678	“ Nothing , ”
98299	98306	98291	98291	I	678	“ Just had an amusing thought . ”
98307	98323	98324	98324	I	678	“ Your thought was so clear on your face . Maybe turn off the broadcast . ”
98456	98468	98469	98469	Jake	195	“ Thank you for joining us again on such short notice , ”
98476	98504	98469	98469	Jake	195	“ We just received the paperwork from the laboratory that did the paternity test . This is the first time any of us will be seeing it . “
98588	98594	98571	98572	Mr. Wright	106	” Everyone but Emery said , “
98597	98661	98571	98572	Mr. Wright	106	” around the table , anxiously staring at the paperwork . He bent back the metal brackets holding the envelope secured and then opened it . A stack of papers came out , and on the top , were the results . I held my breath as Jake read through the document . You could have heard a pin drop in the room . “
98673	98687	98688	98688	Jensen	128	” Jake turned to face me with a giant smile on his face . “
98700	98971	98695	98695	Colton	1377	” Vanessa exclaimed from across the room , and I heard Marc cuss . But it was all background noise to me . It was like being sealed in a vacuum . Colton was my son . He was mine . My boy . I nearly broke down at the very thought that , after all this time , all this worrying , all the arguments and debates and complications … Colton had been mine all along . I ’d been so sure that Vanessa was telling the truth . She had been so sure of the truth . I had let her hang it over my head for years . Years ! But she was wrong . Or she had lied . She had lied to my face all those times . Told me countless times that I had n’t even been in New York the month that she got pregnant . My schedule had n’t always overlapped with hers , but I ’d believed her . She ’d had no reason to say otherwise . Colton had been two years old before I even knew about it . By then , the exact travel dates had been lost on me . I could see them on my work schedule and the flight schedules , but we had n’t always had sex every time I was there . It had been impossible to determine if I was Colt ’s father . Now , I knew that I was . Colton was mine . Emery ’s arms were around me , and I stood , lifting her into the air . “
98979	98986	98972	98972	I	678	” she whispered through the vacuum . “
98993	99069	99074	99074	Vanessa	2268	” I murmured back , forgetting everyone else in the room . I set her back down on her feet , cupped her face in my hands , and kissed the breath out of her . This was the moment I had been born for . The knowledge that I had the woman I loved here with me now and that I would never have to worry about my son again . It was euphoric . “
99076	99087	99074	99074	Vanessa	2268	” Marc cried , jarring me out of my moment . “
99096	99122	99074	99074	Vanessa	2268	” Marc ’s and Vanessa ’s lawyers were looking at the document , but it was clear from their faces that they agreed with Jake . “
99135	99139	99140	99140	Jensen	128	” Vanessa said . “
99158	99159	99154	99154	You	1600	” “
99168	99169	99170	99170	I	678	” “
99177	99187	99188	99188	I	678	” she whispered . Tears brimmed in her eyes . “
99191	99192	99188	99188	I	678	” “
99202	99212	99200	99200	Vanessa	2268	” I said , drawing her attention to me . “
99254	99337	99246	99246	I	678	” At those words , Vanessa completely lost it . She broke down into tears and covered her face in her hands . Vanessa had been holding onto this fact for so long , thinking it was a way to keep me . As if she had thought for a second that I would still hold a flame for her after all she had done . But it was over . There was nothing left . And she had no more control . “
99363	99367	99354	99355	Mr. Tarman	108	” Jake said . “
99387	99411	99384	99385	Ms. Hendricks	196	” Vanessa shook her head , blubbering about how she ’d sworn she knew . She ’d thought this would fix it all . “
99417	99532	99384	99385	Ms. Hendricks	196	” I said to Jake . Sure , I would love to get custody of Colton and have him live here in Lubbock with me . But I did n’t want to go to court with Vanessa over it , and I was n’t willing to disrupt Colt ’s life . He was happy in New York , and he had a great school there . I was n’t the type of person to do something like that just to make someone else miserable . That was all Vanessa . We filed out of the office and stood in the foyer . Vanessa was shaking , talking to her lawyer . Marc approached us . “
99550	99551	99543	99543	Vanessa	2268	” “
99558	99562	99554	99554	you	678	” I said . “
99590	99610	99583	99584	the company	296	” Marc glared and looked ready to throw a punch . Instead , he turned to Emery and grinned . “
99623	99631	99583	99584	the company	296	” Emery arched an eyebrow in disgust . “
99638	99642	99648	99648	he	1377	” He laughed . “
99658	99659	99654	99654	He	1377	” “
99684	99688	99679	99679	I	678	” I growled . “
99691	99692	99679	99679	I	678	” “
99704	99708	99702	99702	Jensen	128	” Emery said . “
99728	99748	99720	99720	You	678	” I turned to face my girl and smiled . She was right . Of course she was right . “
99757	99758	99720	99720	You	678	” “
99766	99879	99880	99880	Jensen	128	” I took Emery ’s hand then and left the lawyer ’s office . I knew there was more to take care of , and I definitely had to get back to the office . But first things first . I needed to set all of this straight . Vanessa might be upset about it . Frankly , I did n’t care for Vanessa ’s opinions any longer . Emery was in my life , and she was here to stay . We showed up at the hotel right after our meeting , and I took Emery up to the top floor . I knocked on the door and Nanny Jennifer answer . “
99890	99894	99882	99882	I	678	” she said . “
99909	99910	99897	99897	Vanessa	2268	” “
99929	99930	99923	99923	I	678	” “
99937	99943	99948	99948	Emery	128	” Jennifer smiled at Emery . “
99950	99951	99945	99945	you	128	” “
99959	99968	99945	99945	you	128	” Emery said , holding out her hand . “
99979	99985	99945	99945	you	128	” I turned to Emery . “
100002	100003	99994	99994	I	678	” “
100007	100011	100012	100012	Colton	1377	” she agreed . “
100019	100035	100036	100036	Daddy	2263	” Nanny Jennifer called . I walked into the suite just as Colton came running . “
100038	100073	100076	100076	champ	2263	” He launched himself into my arms , and I hugged him tighter than I ’d ever squeezed him before . My son . Mine ! No one could ever take him away again . “
100078	100088	100076	100076	champ	2263	” I said . I set him back down . “
100105	100106	100076	100076	champ	2263	” “
100112	100119	100109	100110	A girrrl	1611	” Colton singsonged . I laughed . “
100136	100137	100134	100134	Emery	128	” “
100143	100144	100140	100141	a girlfriend	1077	” “
100166	100205	100209	100209	champ	1377	” Colton looked down at himself and gave me a thumbs up . God , I loved him . I took his hand , and we walked together to the front of the suite where Emery was waiting . “
100218	100255	100256	100256	Emery	128	” I said to Colton . Colton stood very still and smiled up at Emery with the brilliance that only a child could have . Then , I looked up in Emery ’s big green eyes . “
100263	100264	100265	100265	You	1377	” “
100270	100281	100265	100265	You	1377	” he said with a Wright grin . Emery laughed . “
100303	100304	100295	100295	I	678	” “
100317	100318	100305	100305	Dad	85	” “
100326	100327	100319	100319	I	678	” “
100338	100353	100319	100319	I	678	” Emery smiled and looked up at me with a question in her eyes . “
100356	100362	100363	100363	She	1377	” I answered for her . “
100388	100389	100390	100390	I	678	” “
100395	100406	100390	100390	I	678	” Emery said as much to me as to Colton . “
100419	100499	100500	100500	Heidi	208	” We moved back into the living space and took a seat . I picked Colton up and planted him on my knee . Emery sat next to me , and I wrapped my other arm around her . This was our life . It was n’t perfect . It was far from easy . But it was ours . And I loved them both more than words for being a part of it . Epilogue Emery Eight Months Later “
100509	100517	100500	100500	Heidi	208	” I called into the living room . “
100521	100522	100523	100527	The closed - toe ones	1616	” “
100531	100579	100523	100527	The closed - toe ones	1616	” She appeared in my bedroom a minute later , holding a pair of shoes in her hand . Curse of living with someone who could pretty much wear all the same sizes as me . Except jeans , because she was a giant compared to me . “
100583	100612	100523	100527	The closed - toe ones	1616	” I put them on my feet and looked in the mirror at the knee - length black skirt and black top I was wearing with the heels . “
100618	100619	100620	100620	I	678	” “
100625	100632	100623	100623	you	0	” she said with a laugh . “
100650	100651	100657	100657	they	1617	” “
100660	100722	100657	100657	they	1617	” At that moment , a knock came from the front door , and I groaned , trying not to think about high school boys wanting to fuck me . I ’d had enough torture for one lifetime on that front . Before I even reached the front door , Jensen popped open the door with his key to the place . “
100727	100736	100725	100725	babe	0	” he said , giving me a kiss . “
100747	100748	100725	100725	babe	0	” “
100757	100763	100752	100752	I	678	” I asked , concerned . “
100786	100790	100772	100773	Every kid	1618	” I groaned . “
100799	100800	100772	100773	Every kid	1618	” “
100812	100946	100772	100773	Every kid	1618	” He winked . I plucked the shoes off my feet and shoved them into his hands . Then , I dashed back into my bedroom and slipped on a sensible pair of black flats . I grabbed the official - looking teacher bag that Jensen had gotten for me as a congratulations for landing my first high school teaching job . I ’d spent all last semester substitute teaching to build up hours for the certification that I needed to be able to be in the classroom . Then , I ’d applied to what felt like a million jobs all over Lubbock , and somehow , against all odds , I had gotten a job teaching European history at my old high school . My life could not be more ironic . “
100957	100971	100976	100976	Heidi	208	” Jensen joked , smacking my ass on the way out the door . “
100978	100982	100976	100976	Heidi	208	” I called . “
100993	101218	100991	100991	darling	208	” she yelled back . Jensen had the truck , which calmed my nerves . I could n’t imagine driving the Mercedes or the flashier sports car he had recently purchased to Lubbock High School . Sure , there was some oil money at the school … and there had always been the Wright family , but I was n’t part of that elite inner circle — or , at least , I kept telling myself that . Because , when the billionaire CEO himself dropped me off in front of the school , I felt pretty inner circle . Things with Jensen had been much smoother sailing since the post - holidays madness . I spent a couple of nights a week at his house . We flew to New York once a month to see Colton , and he started spending a weekend here every month . I knew Jensen wanted more time with him , but he also did n’t want to interfere with Colton ’s schooling . Vanessa had mellowed out . I was n’t sure if it was the large quantities of Xanax she was taking or what , but she stopped fighting us when we came into town . After eight months , she must have finally decided I was n’t going anywhere . And I was n’t . “
101225	101301	100991	100991	darling	208	” I said . I was trying not to be nervous even though it was really my first official day teaching high school students . I ’d been a TA in college and taught my own introductory history class , but for some reason , high school had felt more daunting than college . Maybe because I ’d found out who I was in college , and I had been so scared of high school . “
101308	101322	101324	101324	anyone	226	” he told me , leaning in and giving me a lingering kiss . “
101335	101336	101324	101324	anyone	226	” “
101351	101352	101342	101342	You	1626	” “
101361	101362	101342	101342	You	1626	” “
101367	101377	101378	101378	I	678	” he said with a roll of his eyes . “
101386	101387	101388	101389	The one	1732	” “
101393	101400	101388	101389	The one	1732	” I whispered against his lips . “
101422	101448	101449	101449	God	2256	” I blushed despite myself . It did n’t matter how much sex we ’d had . I could n’t seem to keep it together . “
101455	101459	101449	101449	God	2256	” he said . “
101466	101642	101644	101644	me	678	” I kissed him once more and then hopped out of the truck . I adjusted my skirt and took in the world I was about to enter . I never thought that I ’d be back . It was kind of cool to think that I could start over here . I entered the building with more optimism than I ’d thought possible . The day went by lightning fast . Way faster than I remembered high school going when I had been there . But , before I knew it , my first day was over . I had over a hundred and fifty names to remember that had completely flitted out of my brain . But I ’d survived . There was Jensen , waiting for me , when I left . Of course , he was in the flashy Corvette . Bright red and low to the ground with the top down . I shook my head and laughed as I approached the car that all the students were staring at . “
101646	101653	101644	101644	me	678	” he asked with a grin . “
101657	101658	101644	101644	me	678	” “
101661	101674	101644	101644	me	678	” He popped open the passenger door , and I dropped inside . “
101688	101699	101701	101701	my	678	” I dropped my head into my hands and groaned . “
101710	101711	101712	101712	Heidi	208	” “
101714	101730	101731	101731	Bitch	200	” He sat down in the driver ’s seat and then obnoxiously revved the engine . “
101733	101741	101731	101731	Bitch	200	” I shook my head in disbelief . “
101757	101761	101763	101763	you	678	” He grinned . “
101768	101840	101763	101763	you	678	” The drive back to his house was unbelievably short in his new car . It blew my hair all around my face , but it was exhilarating . I could see why he loved the thing , and he was already talking about getting something sleek and distinctly European . He was addicted . He parked in the garage and took my hand as I stepped out of the car . “
101849	101857	101858	101858	I	678	” I informed him with a sigh . “
101864	101865	101866	101866	I	678	” “
101890	101891	101879	101879	You	1632	” “
101900	101911	101896	101896	I	678	” He laughed and drew me in for a kiss . “
101924	101955	101896	101896	I	678	” We stepped in through the garage and straight into the kitchen . Jensen flipped the lights , and suddenly , a whole group of people jumped up and screamed , “
101958	101967	101896	101896	I	678	” I put my hand over my mouth . “
101972	102265	101896	101896	I	678	” There were party streamers all over his kitchen and out through the foyer . A giant party cake that read Happy Birthday , Emery with a bunch of lit candles sat in the middle of the island . And all around it were my friends and family and Jensen ’s family . My heart expanded enough to hold them all . I might not have been a birthday person before , but today changed that . I ’d never had good birthdays growing up . They ’d always been filled with disappointment — kids missing parties , no one showing up , and all that . But right here was exactly what I ’d always wanted . Heidi was jumping up and down next to Landon . They both looked ecstatic that they had been able to surprise me . Austin was across the room from Julia but kept glancing her way . She was making a point not to look at him so much that it was clear she wanted to look over . Instead , she beamed extra hard at me . Morgan was leaning into Patrick , and Sutton was holding her new baby boy , Jason , in her arms . Maverick was at her side , indulging her . Then , there was Kimber , Noah , Lilyanne , and Bethany all standing to one side with my mother , of all people . But it was the one other little face who nudged Lilyanne and smiled back at me that surprised me the most . Jensen must have gone to great lengths for this entire thing because Colton was even here . Jensen wrapped an arm around me as Heidi pushed me toward the cake . “
