300	313	314	314	I	5148	“ Almost makes the paintings inside seem redundant , does n’t it ? ”
345	372	314	314	I	5148	“ I ’m so sorry . I know I must look like a giddy tourist , but we do n’t have sunsets like this in Dallas . ”
373	378	379	379	she	5962	“ Do n’t apologize , ”
382	404	379	379	she	5962	“ I pay for that view every month when I write the mortgage check . It damn well better be spectacular . ”
413	417	405	405	I	5148	“ Hiding out ? ”
418	422	405	405	I	5148	“ Excuse me ? ”
423	433	434	434	she	5962	“ You ’re Carl ’s new assistant , right ? ”
445	449	405	405	I	5148	“ Nikki Fairchild . ”
450	459	460	460	She	5962	“ I remember now . Nikki from Texas . ”
485	495	468	468	I	5148	“ So who does he want you to charm ? ”
496	499	500	500	I	5148	“ Charm ? ”
520	549	550	550	She	5962	“ Honey , the man would rather walk on burning coals than come to an art show . He ’s fishing for investors and you ’re the bait . ”
562	600	550	550	She	5962	“ Do n’t worry . I wo n’t press you to tell me who . And I do n’t blame you for hiding out . Carl ’s brilliant , but he ’s a bit of a prick . ”
601	612	613	613	I	5148	“ It ’s the brilliant part I signed on for , ”
636	642	643	643	Carl	2664	“ Wear a cocktail dress , ”
647	651	643	643	Carl	2664	“ Something flirty . ”
796	807	808	808	I	5148	“ I need to get back to being the bait , ”
811	858	808	808	I	5148	“ Oh , hell . Now I ’ve gone and made you feel either guilty or self - conscious . Do n’t be . Let them get liquored up in there first . You catch more flies with alcohol anyway . Trust me . I know . ”
910	923	924	924	she	644	“ I ’m too old and set in my ways to quit , ”
927	968	924	924	she	644	“ But God forbid I smoke in my own damn house . I swear , the mob would burn me in effigy . You ’re not going to start lecturing me on the dangers of secondhand smoke , are you ? ”
969	972	973	973	I	5148	“ No , ”
976	983	924	924	she	644	“ Then how about a light ? ”
993	1010	984	984	I	5148	“ One lipstick , a credit card , my driver ’s license , and my phone . ”
1011	1015	924	924	she	644	“ No condom ? ”
1016	1028	1029	1029	I	5148	“ I did n’t think it was that kind of party , ”
1033	1040	1041	1041	She	646	“ I knew I liked you . ”
1047	1076	1077	1077	She	646	“ What the hell kind of party am I throwing if I do n’t even have one goddamn candle on one goddamn table ? Well , fuck it . ”
1392	1398	1399	1399	Evelyn	5962	“ Take one , honey , ”
1441	1449	1450	1450	she	5962	“ No , do n’t you argue , ”
1457	1477	1478	1478	she	5962	“ I bought a dozen cases and I hate to see good alcohol go to waste . Hell no , ”
1490	1528	1478	1478	she	5962	“ I hate the stuff . Get me a vodka . Straight up . Chilled . Four olives . Hurry up , now . Do you want me to dry up like a leaf and float away ? ”
1566	1610	1559	1559	Evelyn	5962	“ So how do you like LA ? What have you seen ? Where have you been ? Have you bought a map of the stars yet ? Dear God , tell me you ’re not getting sucked into all that tourist bullshit . ”
1611	1626	1559	1559	Evelyn	5962	“ Mostly I ’ve seen miles of freeway and the inside of my apartment . ”
1627	1653	1559	1559	Evelyn	5962	“ Well , that ’s just sad . Makes me even more glad that Carl dragged your skinny ass all the way out here tonight . ”
1714	1730	1711	1711	I	5148	“ I ’m glad he brought me , too . The paintings really are amazing . ”
1731	1753	1754	1754	she	646	“ Now do n’t do that — don’t you go sliding into the polite - conversation routine . No , no , ”
1761	1811	1754	1754	she	646	“ I ’m sure you mean it . Hell , the paintings are wonderful . But you ’re getting the flat - eyed look of a girl on her best behavior , and we ca n’t have that . Not when I was getting to know the real you . ”
1812	1815	1816	1816	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
1819	1830	1816	1816	I	5148	“ I swear I ’m not fading away on you . ”
2055	2062	2063	2063	she	646	“ Where exactly are you living ? ”
2066	2083	2063	2063	she	646	“ Studio City . I ’m sharing a condo with my best friend from high school . ”
2084	2121	2063	2063	she	646	“ Straight down the 101 for work and then back home again . No wonder you ’ve only seen concrete . Did n’t anyone tell you that you should have taken an apartment on the Westside ? ”
2122	2130	2131	2131	I	5148	“ Too pricey to go it alone , ”
2192	2198	2205	2205	Evelyn	5962	“ How old are you ? ”
2199	2204	2205	2205	Evelyn	5962	“ Twenty - four . ”
2219	2271	2205	2205	Evelyn	5962	“ You ’ll be wanting a place of your own soon enough . You call me when you do and we ’ll find you someplace with a view . Not as good as this one , of course , but we can manage something better than a freeway on - ramp . ”
2272	2282	2205	2205	Evelyn	5962	“ It ’s not that bad , I promise . ”
2283	2290	2291	2291	she	5962	“ Of course it ’s not , ”
2302	2307	2308	2308	she	5962	“ As for views , ”
2329	2341	2308	2308	she	5962	“ you ’re welcome to come back anytime and share mine . ”
2342	2351	2352	2352	I	5148	“ I might take you up on that , ”
2355	2373	2352	2352	I	5148	“ I ’d love to bring a decent camera back here and take a shot or two . ”
2374	2442	2308	2308	she	5962	“ It ’s an open invitation . I ’ll provide the wine and you can provide the entertainment . A young woman loose in the city . Will it be a drama ? A rom - com ? Not a tragedy , I hope . I love a good cry as much as the next woman , but I like you . You need a happy ending . ”
2490	2512	2482	2482	Nikki	640	“ To happy endings . And to this amazing party . I think I ’ve kept you from it long enough . ”
2513	2516	2517	2517	she	5962	“ Bullshit , ”
2520	2534	2517	2517	she	5962	“ I ’m the one monopolizing you , and we both know it . ”
2555	2592	2482	2482	Nikki	640	“ The truth is , I ’m a terrible hostess . I do what I want , talk to whoever I want , and if my guests feel slighted they can damn well deal with it . ”
2612	2615	2616	2616	she	5962	“ Besides , ”
2619	2675	2616	2616	she	5962	“ this party is n’t supposed to be about me . I put together this little shindig to introduce Blaine and his art to the community . He ’s the one who should be doing the mingling , not me . I may be fucking him , but I ’m not going to baby him . ”
2719	2733	2734	2734	I	5148	“ I have n’t met Blaine yet . That ’s him , right ? ”
2789	2801	2802	2802	Evelyn	5962	“ That ’s my little center of attention , all right , ”
2805	2818	2819	2819	Her	5962	“ The man of the hour . Talented , is n’t he ? ”
2972	2981	2982	2982	Evelyn	5962	“ I picked a winner with that one , ”
2985	3030	2982	2982	Evelyn	5962	“ But let ’s see . Who do you want to meet ? Rip Carrington and Lyle Tarpin ? Those two are guaranteed drama , that ’s for damn sure , and your roommate will be jealous as hell if you chat them up . ”
3031	3035	3055	3055	She	5962	“ She will ? ”
3042	3054	3055	3055	She	5962	“ Rip and Lyle ? They ’ve been feuding for weeks . ”
3062	3087	3055	3055	She	5962	“ The fiasco about the new season of their sitcom ? It ’s all over the Internet ? You really do n’t know them ? ”
3088	3091	3092	3092	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
3101	3123	3092	3092	I	5148	“ My school schedule was pretty intense . And I ’m sure you can imagine what working for Carl is like . ”
3140	3150	3151	3151	Evelyn	5962	“ That is one serious gap in your education , ”
3154	3177	3151	3151	Evelyn	5962	“ Culture — and yes , pop culture counts — is just as important as — what did you say you studied ? ”
3178	3200	3248	3248	I	5148	“ I do n’t think I mentioned it . But I have a double major in electrical engineering and computer science . ”
3201	3247	3151	3151	Evelyn	5962	“ So you ’ve got brains and beauty . See ? That ’s something else we have in common . Got ta say , though , with an education like that , I do n’t see why you signed up to be Carl ’s secretary . ”
3251	3328	3248	3248	I	5148	“ I ’m not , I swear . Carl was looking for someone with tech experience to work with him on the business side of things , and I was looking for a job where I could learn the business side . Get my feet wet . I think he was a little hesitant to hire me at first — my skills definitely lean toward tech — but I convinced him I ’m a fast learner . ”
3334	3339	3329	3329	She	681	“ I smell ambition . ”
3349	3365	3340	3340	I	5148	“ It ’s Los Angeles . Is n’t that what this town is all about ? ”
3366	3401	3402	3402	She	681	“ Ha ! Carl ’s lucky he ’s got you . It ’ll be interesting to see how long he keeps you . But let ’s see … who here would intrigue you … ? ”
3422	3428	3429	3429	she	681	“ That ’s Charles Maynard , ”
3432	3484	3429	3429	she	681	“ I ’ve known Charlie for years . Intimidating as hell until you get to know him . But it ’s worth it . His clients are either celebrities with name recognition or power brokers with more money than God . Either way , he ’s got all the best stories . ”
3485	3491	3402	3402	She	681	“ He ’s a lawyer ? ”
3492	3504	3429	3429	she	681	“ With Bender , Twain & McGuire . Very prestigious firm . ”
3505	3509	3510	3510	I	5148	“ I know , ”
3530	3554	3526	3526	Rip	237	“ One of my closest friends works for the firm . He started here but he ’s in their New York office now . ”
3555	3570	3571	3571	We	683	“ Well , come on , then , Texas . I ’ll introduce you . ”
3615	3670	3612	3612	She	5962	“ He ’s a pussycat at heart . Trust me , I ’ve worked with him before . Back in my agenting days , we put together more celebrity biopic deals for our clients than I can count . And we fought to keep a few tell - alls off the screen , too . ”
3688	3708	3671	3671	She	5962	“ Still , we ’ll wait ’ til he calms down a bit . In the meantime , though … ”
3731	3782	3783	3783	She	5962	“ I do n’t think he ’s here yet , but — oh ! Yes ! Now there ’s someone you should meet . And if you want to talk views , the house he ’s building has one that makes my view look like , well , like yours . ”
3801	3814	3815	3815	she	5962	“ He hardly ever accepts invitations , but we go way back , ”
3986	3991	3992	3992	Evelyn	5962	“ Damn that girl , ”
3995	4004	3992	3992	Evelyn	5962	“ She never did bring me my vodka . ”
4011	4015	4016	4016	I	5148	“ Damien Stark , ”
4046	4053	4054	4054	she	5962	“ Well , how about that ? ”
4058	4065	4054	4054	she	5962	“ Looks like I guessed right . ”
4066	4070	4071	4071	I	5148	“ You did , ”
4074	4086	4071	4071	I	5148	“ Mr. Stark is just the man I want to see . ”
4088	4096	4071	4071	I	5148	“ Damien Stark is the holy grail . ”
4109	4118	4071	4071	I	5148	“ Damn , Nikki . You look hot . ”
4152	4161	4142	4142	he	2664	“ You know who Stark is , right ? ”
4162	4168	4169	4169	I	5148	“ You saw my resume , ”
4173	4177	4169	4169	I	5148	“ The fellowship ? ”
4290	4295	4296	4296	Carl	2664	“ Right , right , ”
4301	4313	4296	4296	Carl	2664	“ Team April is presenting at Stark Applied Technology on Tuesday . ”
4348	4353	4354	4354	I	5148	“ That ’s fabulous , ”
4407	4411	4412	4412	Carl	2664	“ Damn straight , ”
4415	4440	4441	4441	he	2664	“ We ’re showing off the beta version of the 3 - D training software . Brian and Dave are on point with me , ”
4491	4501	4502	4502	he	2664	“ I want you at the meeting with us , ”
4522	4542	4502	4502	he	2664	“ Right now , we ’re scheduled to meet with Preston Rhodes . Do you know who he is ? ”
4543	4546	4502	4502	he	2664	“ No . ”
4547	4557	4502	4502	he	2664	“ Nobody does . Because Rhodes is a nobody . ”
4586	4616	4502	4502	he	2664	“ Pop quiz , Nikki . How does an up - and - coming genius like me get an in - person meeting with a powerhouse like Damien Stark ? ”
4617	4620	4621	4621	I	5148	“ Networking , ”
4634	4643	4644	4644	He	5148	“ And that ’s why I hired you . ”
4985	4996	4972	4972	he	5148	“ I think we ’re kindred spirits , Miss Fairchild . ”
4997	5002	5004	5004	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
5033	5042	5043	5043	he	5148	“ Neither of us wants to be here , ”
5099	5104	5105	5105	I	5148	“ I — oh , ”
5151	5156	5157	5157	Her	249	“ Damie , darling . ”
5169	5178	5157	5157	Her	249	“ Come . We should go , yes ? ”
5225	5229	5230	5230	he	5148	“ Miss Fairchild , ”
5339	5345	5346	5346	Evelyn	5962	“ Come on , Texas , ”
5355	5362	5346	5346	Evelyn	5962	“ Let ’s go say howdy . ”
5952	5957	5932	5932	Carl	2664	“ Are you okay ? ”
5958	5964	5965	5965	I	5148	“ New shoes . Thanks . ”
6068	6076	6077	6077	Evelyn	5962	“ Nikki is Carl ’s new assistant , ”
6085	6094	6080	6080	I	5148	“ Nikki Fairchild . It ’s a pleasure . ”
6124	6128	6129	6129	he	2664	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
6168	6187	6190	6190	he	2664	“ You ’ll have to excuse me . There ’s something I need to attend to right away . ”
6211	6216	6217	6217	Carl	2664	“ What the fuck ? ”
6318	6321	6325	6325	her	5962	“ Nikki ? ”
6328	6335	6336	6336	I	5148	“ I — it ’s okay , ”
6357	6364	6365	6365	Carl	2664	“ I mean it , Nikki , ”
6382	6389	6371	6371	he	2664	“ What the fuck was that ? ”
6390	6396	6365	6365	Carl	2664	“ I do n’t know . ”
6397	6400	6401	6401	he	2664	“ Bullshit , ”
6404	6436	6401	6401	he	2664	“ Have you met before ? Did you piss him off ? Did you apply for a job with him before me ? What the hell did you do , Nichole ? ”
6447	6453	6437	6437	I	5148	“ It ’s not me , ”
6466	6493	6454	6454	I	5148	“ He ’s famous . He ’s eccentric . He was rude , but it was n’t personal . How the hell could it have been ? ”
6583	6592	6569	6569	Carl	2664	“ I need a drink . Come on . ”
6593	6600	6601	6601	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , thanks . ”
6673	6676	6677	6677	he	2664	“ Fine , ”
6690	6693	6695	6695	he	2664	“ Shit , ”
7166	7170	7171	7171	He	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild . ”
7208	7212	7193	7193	I	5148	“ Fuck off . ”
7213	7220	7193	7193	I	5148	“ I owe you an apology . ”
7223	7226	7227	7227	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
7232	7236	7227	7227	I	5148	“ You do . ”
7256	7273	7248	7248	he	5148	“ It ’s an interesting image . But you would have made a much better model . ”
7278	7289	7248	7248	he	5148	“ That ’s the worst apology I ’ve ever heard . ”
7297	7302	7303	7303	he	5148	“ She ’s weak , ”
7328	7355	7314	7314	I	5148	“ I suppose some people might be drawn to the contrast . Desire and shame . But I prefer something bolder . A more confident sensuality . ”
7417	7425	7426	7426	I	5148	“ I ’m delighted you think so , ”
7429	7438	7426	7426	I	5148	“ But I ’m not the model type . ”
7548	7551	7552	7552	he	5148	“ No , ”
7586	7590	7591	7591	he	5148	“ You are , ”
7594	7618	7591	7591	he	5148	“ But not like this — splashed across a canvas for all the world to see , belonging to no one and everyone . ”
7639	7642	7643	7643	he	5148	“ No , ”
7704	7719	7720	7720	I	5148	“ I was hoping to have the chance to talk to you this evening , ”
7738	7741	7723	7723	His	5148	“ Oh ? ”
7742	7758	7759	7759	He	5148	“ I ’m one of your fellowship recipients . I wanted to say thank you . ”
7770	7809	7766	7766	I	5148	“ I worked my way through college , so the fellowship helped tremendously . I do n’t think I could have graduated with two degrees if it had n’t been for the financial help . So thank you . ”
7840	7857	7858	7858	He	5148	“ And what are you doing now that you ’ve left the hallowed halls of academia ? ”
7879	7889	7890	7890	I	5148	“ I joined the team at C - Squared , ”
7893	7902	7903	7903	Evelyn	5962	“ I ’m Carl Rosenfeld ’s new assistant . ”
7919	7923	7890	7890	I	5148	“ I see . ”
7937	7943	7926	7926	he	5148	“ Is that a problem ? ”
7944	7972	7890	7890	I	5148	“ Two degrees . A straight - A average . Glowing recommendations from all your professors . Acceptance to Ph.D. programs at both MIT and Cal Tech . ”
8005	8030	7926	7926	he	5148	“ I merely find it interesting that you ended up not leading a product development team but doing gruntwork as the owner ’s assistant . ”
8031	8034	8035	8035	I	5148	“ I — ”
8055	8066	7926	7926	he	5148	“ Are you sleeping with your boss , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
8067	8070	7926	7926	he	5148	“ What ? ”
8071	8090	7926	7926	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry . Was the question unclear ? I asked if you were fucking Carl Rosenfeld . ”
8091	8096	8097	8097	I	5148	“ I — no . ”
8144	8147	8148	8148	he	5148	“ Good , ”
8256	8267	8246	8246	He	5148	“ I believe I ’ve shocked you , Ms. Fairchild . ”
8268	8282	8246	8246	He	5148	“ Hell yes , you ’ve shocked me . What did you expect ? ”
8331	8338	8341	8341	Carl	2664	“ Can anyone join this party ? ”
8351	8362	8363	8363	Stark	5148	“ How nice to see you again , Mr. Rosenfeld , ”
8389	8393	8394	8394	I	5148	“ Excuse me , ”
8397	8408	8394	8394	I	5148	“ I need to run to the ladies ’ room . ”
8516	8519	8520	8520	I	5148	“ No , ”
8835	8855	8822	8822	He	2664	“ Say your goodbyes , Nikki . We ’re heading out . Lots to do . Lots to do . ”
8856	8861	8862	8862	I	5148	“ What ? Now ? ”
8871	8895	8822	8822	He	2664	“ Turns out Mr. Stark ’s going to be out of town on Tuesday , so we ’re pushing the meeting to tomorrow . ”
8896	8899	8822	8822	He	2664	“ Saturday ? ”
8900	8906	8907	8907	Stark	5148	“ Is that a problem ? ”
8911	8920	8822	8822	He	2664	“ No , of course not , but — ”
8921	8927	8928	8928	Carl	2664	“ He ’s attending personally , ”
8931	8934	8935	8935	he	5148	“ Personally , ”
8949	8961	8962	8962	I	5148	“ Right . I ’ll just find Evelyn and say goodnight . ”
8976	8985	8935	8935	he	5148	“ I ’d like Ms. Fairchild to stay . ”
8986	8989	8990	8990	Carl	2664	“ What ? ”
8997	9036	9067	9067	she	759	“ The house I ’m building is almost complete . I came here to find a painting for a particular room . I ’d like a feminine perspective . I ’ll see her home safely , of course . ”
9037	9040	9041	9041	Carl	2664	“ Oh . ”
9056	9064	9041	9041	Carl	2664	“ She ’ll be happy to help . ”
9123	9130	9131	9131	he	2664	“ We ’ll speak tomorrow morning , ”
9135	9142	9131	9131	he	2664	“ The meeting ’s at two . ”
9160	9170	9145	9145	he	2664	“ Who the hell do you think you are ? ”
9171	9185	9145	9145	he	2664	“ I know exactly who I am , Ms. Fairchild . Do you ? ”
9186	9202	9145	9145	he	2664	“ Maybe the better question is , who the hell do you think I am ? ”
9203	9210	9145	9145	he	2664	“ Are you attracted to me ? ”
9211	9216	9217	9217	I	5148	“ I — what ? ”
9239	9247	9223	9223	His	2664	“ That is so not the issue . ”
9264	9271	9272	9272	I	5148	“ I ’m Carl ’s assistant , ”
9278	9294	9272	9272	I	5148	“ Not yours . And my job description does not include decorating your goddamn house . ”
9333	9367	9316	9316	Stark	5148	“ If your job duties include helping your boss find capital , then you may want to reconsider how you play the game . Insulting potential investors is probably not the best approach . ”
9383	9387	9388	9388	I	5148	“ Maybe not , ”
9391	9475	9388	9388	I	5148	“ But if you ’re going to withhold your money because I did n’t roll over and flounce my skirts for you , then you ’re not the man the press makes you out to be . The Damien Stark I ’ve read about invests in quality . Not in friendships or relationships or because he thinks some poor little inventor needs the deal . The Damien Stark I admire focuses on talent and talent alone . Or is that just public relations ? ”
9506	9511	9512	9512	he	5148	“ You ’re right , ”
9515	9548	9512	9512	he	5148	“ I ’m not going to invest in C - Squared because I met Carl at a party any more than I ’d invest in it because you ’re in my bed . ”
9549	9552	9563	9563	he	5148	“ Oh . ”
9570	9579	9512	9512	he	5148	“ I do , however , want you . ”
9594	9602	9585	9585	I	5148	“ To help you pick a painting ? ”
9603	9606	9607	9607	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
9610	9614	9607	9607	he	5148	“ For now . ”
9624	9627	9615	9615	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
9628	9656	9585	9585	I	5148	“ Because I need an honest opinion . Most women on my arm say what they think will make me happy , not what they actually mean . ”
9657	9669	9670	9670	I	5148	“ But I ’m not on your arm , Mr. Stark . ”
10389	10393	10394	10395	The bartender	772	“ More champagne ? ”
10533	10541	10542	10542	she	257	“ You will so not believe this , ”
10550	10559	10542	10542	she	257	“ I just did the nasty with Douglas . ”
10560	10569	10542	10542	she	257	“ Oh my God , Jamie . Why ? ”
10686	10706	10707	10707	She	1450	“ We were by the pool drinking wine , and then we got in the hot tub and then … ”
10712	10715	10707	10707	She	1450	“ and then ”
10720	10733	10707	10707	She	1450	“ He ’s still there ? Or are you at his place ? ”
10734	10747	10782	10782	I	5148	“ God , no . I sent him home an hour ago . ”
10748	10751	10707	10707	She	1450	“ Jamie … ”
10752	10781	10782	10782	I	5148	“ What ? I just needed to burn some energy . Trust me , it ’s good . I ’m so mellow now you would n’t even believe . ”
10927	10946	10919	10919	She	784	“ Am I going to have to avert my eyes every time I see him in the complex ? ”
10947	10952	10953	10953	she	784	“ He ’s cool , ”
10956	10961	10953	10953	she	784	“ No big deal . ”
10998	11013	11018	11020	my best friend	784	“ How about you ? Did you actually manage to form words this time ? ”
11105	11111	11112	11112	I	5148	“ I talked to him , ”
11116	11121	11122	11122	Her	784	“ Oh , really ? ”
11128	11137	11122	11122	Her	784	“ And he ’s coming to the presentation . ”
11138	11142	11187	11187	she	784	“ And … ? ”
11148	11160	11143	11143	I	5148	“ That ’s it , Jamie . That was the point . ”
11161	11185	11122	11122	Her	784	“ Oh . Well , okay , then . No , seriously , that ’s fabulous , Nik . You totally rocked it . ”
11198	11206	11143	11143	I	5148	“ So what ’s he like now ? ”
11221	11227	11215	11217	an easy one	794	“ He ’s … intense . ”
11253	11256	11257	11257	Jamie	1450	“ Intense ? ”
11260	11295	11257	11257	Jamie	1450	“ Like that ’s a revelation ? I mean , the guy owns half the known universe . I hardly think he ’d be all warm and fuzzy . More like dark and dangerous . ”
11309	11359	11301	11301	Jamie	1450	“ Anything else to report ? How are the paintings ? I wo n’t ask if you ’ve seen any celebrities . Any celebrity younger than Cary Grant , and you ’re clueless . I mean , you could probably trip over Bradley Cooper and not even know it . ”
11360	11397	11441	11441	she	631	“ Actually , Rip and Lyle are here , and they ’re being civil to each other despite their feud . It ’ll be interesting to see if the show gets picked up for another season . ”
11436	11440	11441	11441	she	631	“ You bitch , ”
11445	11467	11441	11441	she	631	“ If you do n’t come back with Rip Carrington ’s autograph , I am so finding a new best friend . ”
11468	11473	11474	11474	I	5148	“ I ’ll try , ”
11477	11492	11474	11474	I	5148	“ Actually , you could come here . I kind of need a ride . ”
11493	11511	11441	11441	she	631	“ Because Carl keeled over and died from surprise when Stark said he ’d do the meeting ? ”
11512	11530	11474	11474	I	5148	“ Sort of . He left to go prep . The meeting ’s been bumped to tomorrow . ”
11531	11542	11441	11441	she	631	“ And you ’re still at the party , why ? ”
11543	11550	11474	11474	I	5148	“ Stark wanted me to stay . ”
11551	11557	11441	11441	she	631	“ Oh , did he ? ”
11558	11579	11474	11474	I	5148	“ It ’s not like that . He ’s looking to buy a painting . He wanted a female perspective . ”
11580	11592	11441	11441	she	631	“ And since you ’re the only female at the party … ”
11620	11627	11628	11628	I	5148	“ I just need a ride , ”
11639	11646	11628	11628	I	5148	“ Can you come get me ? ”
11647	11676	11616	11616	Stark	5148	“ You ’re serious ? Carl left you stranded in Malibu ? That ’s like an hour away . He did n’t even offer to reimburse cab fare ? ”
11687	11690	11691	11691	she	257	“ What ? ”
11694	11712	11628	11628	I	5148	“ It ’s just that — well , Stark said he ’d make sure I got home . ”
11713	11739	11740	11740	She	257	“ And what ? His Ferrari ’s not good enough for you ? You ’d rather ride in my ten - year - old Corolla ? ”
11862	11867	11868	11868	I	5148	“ You ’re right , ”
11889	11897	11876	11877	Damien Stark	5148	“ I ’ll see you at home . ”
11898	11914	11868	11868	I	5148	“ If I ’m asleep , wake me up . I want to hear everything . ”
11915	11922	11923	11923	I	5148	“ There ’s nothing to tell , ”
11926	11929	11930	11930	she	646	“ Liar , ”
12034	12039	12069	12069	Evelyn	5962	“ be my decorating wench ”
12116	12122	12104	12105	The colonel	266	“ Having a nice time ? ”
12123	12127	12128	12128	I	5148	“ Of course , ”
12134	12138	12139	12139	I	5148	“ I know , ”
12142	12149	12139	12139	I	5148	“ I ’m a terrible liar . ”
12150	12166	12131	12131	She	5962	“ Hell , honey , you were n’t even putting any effort into that one . ”
12167	12176	12177	12177	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m just … ”
12228	12233	12234	12234	Evelyn	5962	“ He ’s inscrutable , ”
12237	12240	12241	12241	She	5962	“ Who ? ”
12304	12307	12308	12308	I	5148	“ Inscrutable ? ”
12311	12321	12322	12322	Evelyn	5962	“ He ’s a hard man to figure out , ”
12325	12404	12322	12322	Evelyn	5962	“ I ’ve known him since he was a boy — his father signed me to represent him when some damn breakfast cereal wanted his face on their television spots . As if Damien Stark with a sugar high was the way we wanted to go . No , I landed the boy some damn good endorsements , helped make him a goddamned household name . But most days I do n’t think I know him at all . ”
12405	12409	12434	12434	her	809	“ Why not ? ”
12410	12419	12420	12420	She	809	“ I told you , Texas . Inscrutable . ”
12437	12468	12420	12420	She	809	“ ’ Course I do n’t fault him , not with the shit that was piled onto that poor kid . Who would n’t end up a little bit damaged ? ”
12469	12486	12487	12487	Stark	5148	“ You mean the fame ? That must have been hard . He was so young . ”
12544	12549	12550	12550	Evelyn	5962	“ No , no . ”
12560	12582	12583	12583	She	5962	“ Damien knows how to handle the press . He ’s damn good at protecting his secrets , always has been . ”
12606	12657	12600	12600	I	5148	“ Oh , honey , listen to me ramble . No , Damien Stark is just one of those dark , quiet types . He ’s like an iceberg , Texas . The deep parts are well hidden and what you do see is hard and a little bit cold . ”
12721	12729	12730	12730	Evelyn	5962	“ What I ’m trying to say , ”
12733	12777	12730	12730	Evelyn	5962	“ is that you should n’t take it personally . The way he acted , I mean . I doubt he meant to be rude . He was probably just off in his head and did n’t even realize what he was doing . ”
12831	12840	12841	12841	I	5148	“ You were right about Rip and Lyle , ”
12870	12886	12845	12845	she	5962	“ My roommate is in awe that I ’m in the same room with them . ”
12887	12900	12862	12862	we	813	“ Well , come on , then . I ’ll introduce you . ”
13093	13097	13098	13098	I	5148	“ That man , ”
13144	13150	13133	13133	I	5148	“ Is that Orlando McKee ? ”
13151	13156	13157	13157	she	5962	“ You know Orlando ? ”
13166	13184	13185	13185	She	5962	“ Of course . The friend who works for Charles . But where did you two meet ? ”
13222	13228	13229	13229	I	5148	“ We grew up together , ”
13477	13487	13488	13488	He	837	“ Nikki ? My God , you look amazing . ”
13515	13521	13508	13508	he	837	“ Do I pass inspection ? ”
13522	13528	13488	13488	He	837	“ When have you not ? ”
13529	13538	13508	13508	he	837	“ Why are n’t you in New York ? ”
13539	13568	13569	13569	He	837	“ The firm transferred me back last week . I was going to call you this weekend . I could n’t remember when you were moving out here . ”
13590	13600	13578	13578	I	5148	“ Damn , it ’s good to see you . ”
13601	13611	13612	13615	the guy in jeans	830	“ I take it you two know each other , ”
13619	13622	13623	13623	Ollie	837	“ Sorry , ”
13626	13643	13623	13623	Ollie	837	“ Nikki , this is Jeff . We work together at Bender , Twain & McGuire . ”
13644	13655	13656	13656	Jeff	270	“ What he means is that I work for him , ”
13659	13691	13656	13656	Jeff	270	“ I ’m a summer associate . Orlando is a third year now , and they love him there . I think Maynard ’s about ready to make him a partner . ”
13692	13696	13697	13697	Ollie	837	“ Very funny , ”
13705	13710	13711	13711	I	5148	“ Look at you , ”
13714	13727	13711	13711	I	5148	“ My little guppy ’s grown into a full - fledged shark . ”
13728	13754	13656	13656	Jeff	270	“ Ah - ah . You know the rules . For every lawyer joke you make , I get to make two dumb blonde jokes . ”
13755	13761	13711	13711	I	5148	“ I take it back . ”
13762	13768	13769	13769	Evelyn	5962	“ Come on , Jeff , ”
13772	13792	13769	13769	Evelyn	5962	“ Let ’s let these two catch up . We ’ll go find our own trouble to get into . ”
14075	14080	14081	14081	I	5148	“ How ’s Courtney ? ”
14084	14092	14081	14081	I	5148	“ Is she glad you ’re back ? ”
14115	14118	14103	14103	Courtney	271	“ On again ”
14138	14141	14103	14103	Courtney	271	“ Off again ”
14153	14158	14159	14159	he	837	“ She ’s engaged , ”
14162	14165	14166	14166	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
14209	14215	14205	14205	he	837	“ To me , doofus . ”
14216	14222	14223	14223	I	5148	“ Oh , thank God ! ”
14231	14239	14223	14223	I	5148	“ I thought you ’d blown it . ”
14245	14287	14240	14240	His	837	“ I almost did . New York was hard . Being away from her . Being tempted . But no more . She ’s the only woman for me . Damn , Nik . How did I manage to get her ? ”
14288	14296	14240	14240	His	837	“ Because you ’re a great guy . ”
14297	14308	14240	14240	His	837	“ I ’m fucked up , and you know it . ”
14309	14329	14240	14240	His	837	“ Everyone ’s a little fucked up , but Courtney sees the guy underneath . And she loves you . ”
14330	14334	14335	14335	he	837	“ She does , ”
14341	14357	14358	14358	He	837	“ It amazes me every day , but it ’s true . She really does . ”
14363	14375	14358	14358	He	837	“ Speaking of fucked up , how are you really doing ? ”
14384	14394	14376	14376	I	5148	“ I ’m great . I already told you . ”
14461	14480	14458	14458	I	5148	“ It ’s easier now . College was fucked up for a while , but it got better . ”
14499	14524	14525	14525	I	5148	“ And now , I do n’t know . But it feels good being away from Texas . Really , I ’m doing fine . ”
14545	14551	14538	14538	I	5148	“ We should get back . ”
14624	14633	14634	14634	he	837	“ So how do you feel about tuxedos ? ”
14649	14656	14657	14657	I	5148	“ I feel good about them , ”
14660	14698	14657	14657	I	5148	“ Tuxedos are a time - honored tradition in the world of formal wear . I have to take points off for practicality , though . Hard to surf in a tux . Doable , but hard . ”
14702	14712	14713	14713	he	837	“ I want you to be my best man , ”
14726	14733	14734	14734	he	837	“ Courtney ’s cool with it , ”
14737	14775	14734	14734	he	837	“ but she thinks the pictures will look better if you wear a tux . You know , the guy side in penguin suits , the girl side in silk and satin . What do you say ? ”
14784	14795	14776	14776	I	5148	“ I love you . You know that , right ? ”
14796	14823	14824	14824	He	837	“ That ’s why I ’m asking . It was either that or marry you , and I think the second option would piss Courtney off . ”
14843	14846	14839	14839	his	837	“ Thanks . ”
14847	14851	14839	14839	his	837	“ For what ? ”
14852	14859	14839	14839	his	837	“ For being happy for me . ”
14860	14864	14865	14865	I	5148	“ I am , ”
14934	14937	14929	14929	I	5148	“ Nik ? ”
14945	14963	14938	14938	I	5148	“ Ignore me . I ’m just being emotional and weird . Girls and weddings , right ? ”
14964	14971	14972	14972	he	5148	“ Nothing ’s changing , Nik , ”
14988	15000	14976	14976	he	5148	“ Anything you need , anytime . Courtney wo n’t mind . ”
15006	15013	15004	15004	me	5148	“ She does n’t know about — ”
15014	15027	15028	15028	he	5148	“ Of course not . I mean , she knows about Ashley , ”
15119	15133	15134	15134	Ollie	837	“ I only told Courtney that she ’d died and you were grieving , ”
15138	15148	15134	15134	Ollie	837	“ You know I ’d never share your secrets . ”
15169	15185	15186	15186	He	837	“ Looks like we ’re not the only ones who wanted to escape the hoopla . ”
15307	15311	15312	15312	Stark	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
15345	15352	15330	15330	His	5148	“ I was looking for you . ”
15353	15356	15357	15357	I	5148	“ Oh ? ”
15369	15372	15357	15357	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
15373	15379	15330	15330	His	5148	“ You ’re my responsibility . ”
15387	15402	15380	15380	I	5148	“ I hardly see how . I barely even know you , Mr. Stark . ”
15403	15415	15357	15357	I	5148	“ I promised your boss I ’d see you safely home . ”
15451	15476	15437	15437	I	5148	“ I ’m about to head home . I ’ll be happy to give Nikki a lift . You can consider your responsibility absolved . ”
15586	15600	15576	15576	I	5148	“ That would be great . Are you sure it ’s not inconvenient ? ”
15601	15609	15610	15610	he	5148	“ It ’s no problem at all , ”
15679	15687	15688	15688	Stark	5148	“ I ’m not looking for absolution , ”
15693	15709	15688	15688	Stark	5148	“ But I do need Ms. Fairchild to stay . We have business to discuss . ”
15751	15756	15742	15742	I	5148	“ It ’s okay . ”
15757	15762	15763	15763	His	837	“ You ’re sure ? ”
15770	15773	15774	15774	I	5148	“ Seriously , ”
15777	15782	15774	15774	I	5148	“ Go on home . ”
15789	15796	15797	15797	he	837	“ I ’ll call you tomorrow , ”
15868	15871	15872	15872	Stark	5148	“ Wait , ”
15940	15945	15946	15946	Ollie	837	“ It ’s okay , ”
15949	15956	15946	15946	Ollie	837	“ I ’ll get it later . ”
15981	15985	15986	15986	Stark	5148	“ No need , ”
16023	16027	16028	16028	he	5148	“ Be careful , ”
16091	16129	16085	16085	I	5148	“ Do we actually have any business to discuss ? Because it seems to me that my business is downtown . With Carl . Preparing for a meeting I ’ll be attending in just over sixteen hours . ”
16130	16134	16135	16135	he	5148	“ The paintings , ”
16139	16149	16135	16135	he	5148	“ I believe you were going to help me ? ”
16150	16169	16085	16085	I	5148	“ Your belief system is all screwed up . I recall quite clearly declining your request for help . ”
16170	16191	16135	16135	he	5148	“ My mistake . I thought you ’d changed your mind after I pointed out that I valued your opinion . ”
16192	16201	16202	16202	I	5148	“ You thought I ’d changed my mind ? ”
16205	16229	16202	16202	I	5148	“ And on what did you base that hypothesis ? The way I walked away from you ? The way I ignored you ? ”
16370	16375	16376	16376	he	5148	“ You ’re cold , ”
16388	16394	16376	16376	he	5148	“ You have goose bumps . ”
16408	16418	16419	16419	I	5148	“ I was fine when I had a coat , ”
16460	16467	16468	16468	I	5148	“ We ’re going back inside , ”
16479	16486	16468	16468	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , really . ”
16499	16512	16487	16487	He	5148	“ Put it on . I do n’t want you catching cold . ”
16513	16521	16522	16522	I	5148	“ Oh , for Christ ’s sake , ”
16532	16541	16522	16522	I	5148	“ Do you always get what you want ? ”
16554	16557	16558	16558	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
16570	16600	16564	16565	the guy	243	“ Fine . Let ’s go inside . Look at some paintings . I ’ll tell you what I like , and then you ’ll do whatever you want . ”
16612	16616	16601	16601	He	5148	“ Excuse me ? ”
16617	16635	16644	16644	he	5148	“ You just do n’t seem like the kind of guy who actually takes anybody ’s advice . ”
16636	16643	16644	16644	he	5148	“ You ’re wrong , Nikki , ”
16657	16667	16644	16644	he	5148	“ I consider very carefully any opinion I value . ”
16736	16739	16740	16740	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
16744	16749	16740	16740	he	5148	“ Look at me . ”
16777	16790	16791	16791	Blam	275	“ That man you were with . Who is he to you ? ”
16942	16956	16933	16933	my	5148	“ Him ? That ’s Orlando McKee . We used to sleep together . ”
17033	17036	17037	17037	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
17090	17099	17070	17070	I	5148	“ What is Mr. McKee to you now ? ”
17118	17124	17125	17125	I	5148	“ He ’s a friend , ”
17128	17134	17125	17125	I	5148	“ A very good friend . ”
17169	17177	17168	17168	his	5148	“ Are you sleeping with him now ? ”
17203	17234	17191	17191	His	5148	“ Am I on some sort of game show ? Have you and your millions invested in a new version of Candid Camera ? A spin - off of Punk’d ? ”
17235	17242	17168	17168	his	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
17243	17253	17191	17191	His	5148	“ You ’re nice , then you ’re ice . ”
17254	17258	17168	17168	his	5148	“ Am I ? ”
17259	17286	17191	17191	His	5148	“ Do n’t even pretend not to know what I ’m talking about . One minute you ’re so rude I want to slap your face — ”
17287	17294	17168	17168	his	5148	“ And yet you do n’t . ”
17304	17320	17295	17295	I	5148	“ And then you turn on a dime and you ’re all warm and fuzzy . ”
17325	17328	17321	17321	His	5148	“ Fuzzy ? ”
17329	17358	17191	17191	His	5148	“ Point taken . Fuzzy is not a word anyone should use to describe you . Forget warm and fuzzy . We ’ll go with hot and intense . ”
17359	17362	17363	17363	He	5148	“ Intense . ”
17379	17387	17363	17363	He	5148	“ I like the sound of that . ”
17403	17412	17395	17395	I	5148	“ The point is , you ’re dizzying . ”
17421	17431	17413	17413	He	5148	“ I like the sound of that , too . ”
17432	17440	17413	17413	He	5148	“ Dizzying and exasperating . And impertinent . ”
17441	17444	17445	17445	he	5148	“ Impertinent ? ”
17463	17474	17413	17413	He	5148	“ You ask questions you have no right to ask . ”
17475	17498	17413	17413	He	5148	“ And you ’ve steered this conversation in a very elegant circle . But you still have n’t answered my impertinent question . ”
17499	17520	17413	17413	He	5148	“ I would have thought that a man as intelligent as you are would realize that I was avoiding it . ”
17521	17548	17549	17549	He	5148	“ A man does n’t get where I ’ve gotten by allowing details to remain ignored . I ’m both diligent and persistent , Ms. Fairchild . ”
17560	17583	17549	17549	He	5148	“ When I seek to acquire something , I learn everything I can about it , and then I pursue it wholeheartedly . ”
17597	17601	17584	17584	I	5148	“ Do you ? ”
17602	17626	17549	17549	He	5148	“ I believe there ’s an interview with me in last month ’s Forbes . I ’m certain the reporter outlined my tenacity . ”
17627	17638	17584	17584	I	5148	“ I ’ll be sure to pick up a copy . ”
17639	17661	17549	17549	He	5148	“ I ’ll have my office send you one . Perhaps then you ’ll understand just how persistent I can be . ”
17662	17693	17694	17694	I	5148	“ I already understand it . What I do n’t get is why you ’re so fascinated with who I ’m sleeping with . Why exactly does that interest you ? ”
17728	17741	17713	17713	He	869	“ There are a number of things about you that fascinate me . ”
17754	17764	17765	17765	I	5148	“ I ’m an open book , Mr. Stark . ”
17771	17788	17765	17765	I	5148	“ You and I both know that ’s not true , Ms. Fairchild . But someday … ”
17804	17809	17789	17789	He	869	“ Someday , what ? ”
17810	17828	17765	17765	I	5148	“ Someday you will be open for me , Ms. Fairchild . In so very many ways . ”
17898	17903	17892	17892	Stark	5148	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
17904	17913	17914	17914	He	5148	“ Nothing . Something sharp on the step . ”
17939	17943	17944	17944	he	5148	“ Very nice , ”
17947	17955	17944	17944	he	5148	“ Perhaps you should put them on . ”
17956	17959	17960	17960	I	5148	“ Nice ? ”
17963	18003	17960	17960	I	5148	“ They are n’t nice . They ’re astounding . They cup my foot , show off my pedicure , slim my leg , and lift my ass just enough to make it look damn hot in this dress . ”
18013	18024	18007	18007	his	5148	“ I recall . Truly , they are amazing shoes . ”
18025	18044	17944	17944	he	5148	“ They also happen to be my first and only purchase from my frivolous Los Angeles shopping splurge . ”
18045	18059	18007	18007	his	5148	“ Well worth the damage to your checking account , I ’m sure . ”
18060	18114	17944	17944	he	5148	“ Totally . But they are an absolute bitch to walk in . And now that I ’ve taken them off I really do n’t know if I can get them back on again . No , correction . I do n’t know if I can get them on again and actually walk . ”
18115	18139	18007	18007	his	5148	“ I see your dilemma . Fortunately , I ’ve made a career out of coming up with solutions to such knotty problems . ”
18140	18152	17944	17944	he	5148	“ Is that so ? Well , please . Enlighten me . ”
18153	18178	18007	18007	his	5148	“ You can stay here on the steps . You can go inside barefoot . You can put the shoes back on and suffer . ”
18179	18220	17944	17944	he	5148	“ Somehow I expected something better from the great Damien Stark . If that ’s all the brainpower it takes to become the head of a corporate empire , I should have jumped all over that a long time ago . ”
18221	18226	18007	18007	his	5148	“ Sorry to disappoint . ”
18227	18234	18235	18235	I	5148	“ Staying here wo n’t work , ”
18238	18258	18235	18235	I	5148	“ For one thing , it ’s cold . For another , I want to say goodbye to Evelyn . ”
18259	18262	18263	18263	He	5148	“ Mmm . ”
18268	18283	18263	18263	He	5148	“ You ’re so right . Clearly I did n’t fully examine the conundrum . ”
18284	18293	18294	18294	I	5148	“ That ’s what makes it a conundrum , ”
18297	18334	18294	18294	I	5148	“ As for going barefoot , Elizabeth Fairchild ’s daughter does not go barefoot at social events , no matter how much she might want to . I ’m pretty sure it ’s a genetic trait . ”
18335	18352	18263	18263	He	5148	“ Then your choice is clear . You ’re going to have to wear the shoes . ”
18353	18367	18294	18294	I	5148	“ And suffer ? No thank you . I do n’t do pain . ”
18423	18430	18417	18417	I	5148	“ There is one more option . ”
18431	18443	18417	18417	I	5148	“ Ah , see ? You were holding out on me . ”
18444	18457	18417	18417	I	5148	“ I can pick you up and carry you into the party . ”
18458	18461	18462	18462	I	5148	“ Right , ”
18465	18479	18462	18462	I	5148	“ I ’m just going to slip these puppies back on and suffer . ”
18583	18598	18570	18570	he	5148	“ Some things are worth the pain . I ’m glad you understand that . ”
18607	18610	18599	18599	I	5148	“ What ? ”
18611	18629	18599	18599	I	5148	“ I ’m simply saying that I ’m glad you decided to put the shoes back on . ”
18630	18655	18599	18599	I	5148	“ Even though that meant I rejected your offer to throw me over your shoulder caveman - style and cart me around the party ? ”
18656	18673	18674	18674	He	5148	“ I do n’t recall mentioning a caveman carry , though the idea is undeniably intriguing . ”
18685	18691	18599	18599	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
18692	18697	18698	18698	he	5148	“ Making a note , ”
18708	18728	18729	18729	I	5148	“ I ’ll say this , Mr. Stark . Whatever else you are , you ’re always a surprise . ”
18736	18768	18729	18729	I	5148	“ I do n’t suppose you have a pair of black flip - flops hidden on your person ? Because that would be the kind of surprise I could really use . ”
18769	18775	18776	18776	he	5148	“ I ’m afraid not , ”
18779	18810	18776	18776	he	5148	“ But in the future I may have to carry a pair just to be safe . I never realized what valuable currency a comfortable pair of shoes can be . ”
18882	18893	18894	18894	he	5148	“ The truth is I know exactly how you feel , ”
18911	18934	18894	18894	he	5148	“ I ’ve always hated tennis shoes . I used to practice in my bare feet . It made my coach crazy . ”
18935	18938	18939	18939	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
18950	18959	18939	18939	I	5148	“ But did n’t you endorse a brand ? ”
18960	18968	18894	18894	he	5148	“ The only brand I could stand . ”
18969	18986	18939	18939	I	5148	“ That ’s a nice little rhyme . They could have used it as the tagline . ”
18987	19002	19003	19003	He	5148	“ It ’s a pity they did n’t have you on their marketing team . ”
19293	19298	19299	19299	he	5148	“ You ’re warm , ”
19354	19359	19360	19360	I	5148	“ For medicinal purposes , ”
19684	19695	19702	19702	his	5148	“ Is there something on your mind , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
19749	19756	19740	19740	I	5148	“ You are , Mr. Stark . ”
19769	19778	19764	19764	he	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear it . ”
19833	19855	19805	19805	He	5148	“ You should know , Ms. Fairchild , that before the night is over , I ’m going to kiss you . ”
19856	19859	19860	19860	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
19904	19915	19916	19916	His	5148	“ I ’m glad you ’re looking forward to it . ”
19951	19963	19964	19964	I	5148	“ I ’m not sure that would be a good idea , ”
19994	20009	20010	20010	I	5148	“ On the contrary . I think it ’s one of my better ideas . ”
20175	20179	20180	20180	I	5148	“ Excuse me , ”
20219	20225	20226	20226	he	892	“ You should slow down , ”
20247	20252	20253	20253	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
20256	20262	20253	20253	I	5148	“ I have a plan . ”
20279	20316	20253	20253	I	5148	“ If it involves getting so rip - roaring drunk that you have no choice but to get off your feet by laying down , then I ’d say your plan is coming along quite nicely . ”
20317	20323	20324	20324	I	5148	“ Do n’t be patronizing . ”
20361	20369	20347	20347	I	5148	“ I assume you want a nude ? ”
20398	20408	20392	20392	He	892	“ I thought you were disinclined to help me . ”
20409	20417	20418	20418	I	5148	“ I ’m in a charitable mood , ”
20421	20451	20418	20418	I	5148	“ So ? Nude ? Landscape ? Still life with fruit ? I ’m assuming that since we ’re here at Evelyn ’s show , you ’re thinking nude . ”
20452	20465	20392	20392	He	892	“ It ’s certainly at the forefront of my mind , yes . ”
20466	20477	20418	20418	I	5148	“ Do you see anything here that appeals to you ? ”
20478	20484	20392	20392	He	892	“ I do , actually . ”
20563	20567	20558	20558	I	5148	“ Show me . ”
20568	20572	20611	20611	his	892	“ Pardon me ? ”
20582	20589	20573	20573	I	5148	“ Show me what you like . ”
20590	20606	20558	20558	I	5148	“ Believe me , Ms. Fairchild , I ’d be very happy to do that . ”
20679	20691	20657	20657	He	892	“ You need to take them off before you hurt yourself . ”
20692	20705	20663	20663	I	5148	“ Not happening . I do n’t do bare feet at parties . ”
20706	20709	20710	20710	He	892	“ Fine . ”
20745	20756	20725	20725	He	892	“ Or perhaps I should simply use the caveman carry ? ”
20848	20851	20852	20852	he	892	“ Now , ”
20855	20863	20864	20864	he	892	“ Take your shoes off . No , ”
20872	20896	20864	20864	he	892	“ we ’re behind the rope , so we ’re not officially at the party now . You ’re not breaking any rules . ”
20912	20916	20917	20917	he	892	“ Move sideways , ”
20920	20928	20917	20917	he	892	“ Put your feet in my lap . ”
20944	20951	20917	20917	he	892	“ Close your eyes . Relax . ”
21216	21219	21220	21220	he	892	“ Now , ”
21242	21250	21251	21251	he	892	“ I ’m going to kiss you , ”
21979	21984	21961	21961	He	5148	“ Damien , what — ”
22002	22015	21987	21987	I	5148	“ I ’ve been looking everywhere for you . Are you ready ? ”
22056	22065	22066	22066	he	5148	“ I need to see Ms. Fairchild home , ”
22126	22131	22115	22115	He	5148	“ Let ’s go . ”
22382	22387	22388	22388	he	5148	“ Goodnight , Nikki , ”
22405	22414	22388	22388	he	5148	“ I look forward to the presentation tomorrow . ”
22909	22915	22916	22916	I	5148	“ I am so wasted , ”
22932	22938	22916	22916	I	5148	“ I ’m not surprised , ”
22951	22960	22916	22916	I	5148	“ I believe I suggested you slow down . ”
22961	22972	22973	22973	I	5148	“ Mr. Stark ? How did you get this number ? ”
22981	22989	22990	22990	His	5148	“ I wanted to hear your voice . ”
23013	23016	22990	22990	His	5148	“ Oh . ”
23017	23027	22990	22990	His	5148	“ And I ’d like to see you again . ”
23034	23038	23028	23028	I	5148	“ You will , ”
23053	23062	23028	23028	I	5148	“ I ’ll be at the meeting tomorrow . ”
23063	23121	23028	23028	I	5148	“ I ’m very much looking forward to it . Perhaps it would have been more prudent for me to wait and talk to you then . But the thought of you relaxed and tipsy , leaning back against the leather of my limo … well , that was an image I simply could n’t pass up . ”
23146	23154	23155	23155	he	917	“ I want to see you again , ”
23177	23186	23155	23155	he	917	“ Do you always get what you want ? ”
23187	23191	23192	23192	he	917	“ I do , ”
23196	23204	23192	23192	he	917	“ Especially when the desire is mutual . ”
23205	23210	23211	23211	I	5148	“ It ’s not , ”
23214	23217	23218	23218	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
23262	23265	23252	23252	Nikki	5143	“ Really . ”
23266	23279	23252	23252	Nikki	5143	“ How did you feel when I put you in the limo ? ”
23307	23310	23300	23300	I	5148	“ Nichole ? ”
23311	23318	23319	23319	I	5148	“ Do n’t call me that , ”
23344	23350	23351	23351	he	917	“ All right , Nikki , ”
23367	23380	23351	23351	he	917	“ How did you feel when I put you in the limo ? ”
23381	23393	23351	23351	he	917	“ I was pissed . And you damn well knew it . ”
23394	23429	23351	23351	he	917	“ Because I was sending you home alone in a limo ? Or because I was sending you home alone in a limo so that I could keep a date with a beautiful woman ? ”
23430	23460	23351	23351	he	917	“ In case it escaped your notice , we barely know each other . You are perfectly entitled to go out with whomever you want , whenever you want . ”
23461	23472	23351	23351	he	917	“ And you ’re within your rights to be jealous . ”
23473	23502	23351	23351	he	917	“ I ’m not jealous , and no , I would n’t be within my rights . Let me repeat the salient point : I hardly know you . ”
23503	23543	23351	23351	he	917	“ I see . So the fact that we crave each other does n’t play into it ? Nor the fact that I made you wet ? That I held your cunt in my hand and made you moan ? ”
23561	23577	23601	23601	He	919	“ Tell me then , at what level of intimacy can jealousy rear its head ? ”
23578	23600	23601	23601	He	919	“ I — I’ve drunk my weight in champagne tonight . I am not even going to attempt to answer that . ”
23740	23746	23747	23747	he	5148	“ Her name is Giselle , ”
23756	23768	23747	23747	he	5148	“ She owns the gallery that ’s showing Blaine ’s work . ”
23769	23778	23747	23747	he	5148	“ I thought Evelyn was showing the work . ”
23779	23851	23747	23747	he	5148	“ Evelyn hosted the party . She ’s become something of a patron for Blaine . But tomorrow morning the paintings will be transported to Giselle ’s gallery . This cocktail date with Giselle and her husband has been on my calendar for over a week now . It ’s business , and not something I could get out of . But I did step away in order to call you . ”
23852	23855	23856	23857	Her husband	923	“ Oh . ”
23859	23862	23856	23857	Her husband	923	“ Oh . ”
23937	23943	23944	23944	I	5148	“ So where are you ? ”
23954	23959	23960	23960	he	5148	“ Sur la Mer , ”
23980	23988	23960	23960	he	5148	“ I ’ve heard it ’s excellent . ”
23989	23995	23996	23996	he	5148	“ The food is exquisite , ”
23999	24050	23996	23996	he	5148	“ but it ’s the ambience that really sets the place apart . It ’s charming , but intimate . It ’s the perfect place to have a drink and discuss business when one does n’t want to be overheard . Or to not discuss business , for that matter . ”
24067	24076	24062	24062	I	5148	“ And you ’re there strictly for business ? ”
24084	24114	24077	24077	His	5148	“ I assure you that a tryst with Giselle and her husband is not on the agenda . I ’m not interested in men . Or in married women . ”
24119	24141	24115	24115	I	5148	“ I want to see you again , Nikki . And I think you would enjoy the food here very much . ”
24142	24147	24149	24149	my	5148	“ Just the food ? ”
24184	24194	24115	24115	I	5148	“ Well , the coffee is good , too . ”
24195	24202	24203	24203	I	5148	“ I — I like coffee , ”
24212	24224	24206	24206	I	5148	“ But I do n’t think it ’s a good idea . ”
24225	24239	24115	24115	I	5148	“ Thousands of coffee bean growers across the globe would disagree with you . ”
24240	24261	24206	24206	I	5148	“ Dinner . Coffee . A date . With you . I do n’t think it ’s a good idea . ”
24262	24271	24115	24115	I	5148	“ Really ? I find it exceptionally appealing . ”
24272	24276	24206	24206	I	5148	“ Mr. Stark … ”
24277	24281	24282	24282	he	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
24295	24300	24206	24206	I	5148	“ You ’re exasperating . ”
24301	24326	24206	24206	I	5148	“ So I ’ve been told . But I prefer the word ‘ persistent . ’ I do n’t take no for an answer . ”
24327	24338	24206	24206	I	5148	“ Sometimes , that ’s the only answer there is . ”
24339	24351	24206	24206	I	5148	“ Perhaps . But this is n’t one of those times . ”
24370	24408	24359	24359	I	5148	“ Is n’t it ? You forget that I ’m the one who has to say yes or no , and I ’ve already told you my answer , and I do n’t intend to change it . ”
24409	24412	24206	24206	I	5148	“ No ? ”
24413	24429	24359	24359	I	5148	“ Sorry . But I ’m afraid you ’ve met your match , Mr. Stark . ”
24430	24439	24440	24440	he	5148	“ I certainly hope so , Ms. Fairchild , ”
24483	24506	24514	24514	His	5148	“ I asked you this once and you evaded the question . Let me try again — are you attracted to me ? ”
24507	24513	24555	24555	I	5148	“ I — excuse me ? ”
24521	24554	24514	24514	His	5148	“ I ’m quite certain you heard me , but in the interest of fair play , I ’ll repeat the question . Slowly and clearly . Are you attracted to me ? ”
24575	24583	24584	24584	he	5148	“ It ’s not a trick question , ”
24595	24599	24600	24600	I	5148	“ I am , ”
24618	24644	24600	24600	I	5148	“ But so what ? What straight female on this planet is n’t attracted to you ? I ’m still not going out with you . ”
24645	24665	24600	24600	I	5148	“ I get what I want , Nikki . You should know that about me right from the start . ”
24666	24695	24600	24600	I	5148	“ And you want dinner with me ? I ’d think a man in your position would want something a bit more impressive . Like to colonize Mars . ”
24696	24709	24710	24710	he	5148	“ Dinner is just the beginning . I want to touch you , ”
24719	24757	24710	24710	he	5148	“ I want to run my hands over every inch of you . I want you wet for me . I want to finish what we started , Ms. Fairchild . I want to make you come . ”
24801	24812	24788	24788	I	5148	“ I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . ”
24813	24849	24783	24783	I	5148	“ It ’s an extremely good idea . Hell , it ’s all I ’ve been thinking about since I put you in that limo . Touching you again . Stroking you . Kissing you . ”
24877	24889	24788	24788	I	5148	“ Tell me you have n’t thought of it , too . ”
24890	24895	24896	24896	I	5148	“ I have n’t , ”
24899	24919	24896	24896	I	5148	“ Do n’t lie to me , Nikki . That ’s rule number one . Never lie to me . ”
24922	24928	24929	24929	I	5148	“ Is this a game ? ”
24932	24937	24788	24788	I	5148	“ Is n’t everything ? ”
24943	24954	24955	24955	His	5148	“ Simon Says , Nikki . Have you played before ? ”
24963	24966	24955	24955	His	5148	“ Yes . ”
24967	24975	24955	24955	His	5148	“ Is the privacy screen in place ? ”
25060	25066	25067	25067	Damien	5148	“ He ’s very discreet , ”
25076	25100	25067	25067	Damien	5148	“ But why torment the man ? The silver button on the console behind you controls the screen . Do you see it ? ”
25117	25120	25101	25101	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
25121	25125	25135	25135	His	931	“ Push it . ”
25126	25134	25101	25101	I	5148	“ You did n’t say Simon says . ”
25141	25175	25135	25135	His	931	“ Good girl . Are you suggesting you ’d rather leave it down ? Think before you answer , Nikki . For what I have planned , most women would like some privacy . ”
25390	25395	25396	25396	I	5148	“ It ’s up , ”
25413	25419	25396	25396	I	5148	“ Take off your panties . ”
25425	25435	25396	25396	I	5148	“ What if I told you I already did ? ”
25436	25450	25470	25470	I	5148	“ I ’m in public , Ms. Fairchild . Do n’t torment me . ”
25451	25457	25458	25458	I	5148	“ You ’re tormenting me , ”
25461	25469	25458	25458	I	5148	“ Good . Now take them off . ”
25500	25505	25506	25506	I	5148	“ They ’re off , ”
25523	25528	25513	25513	I	5148	“ I ’m wet . ”
25541	25545	25546	25546	he	5148	“ No talking , ”
25549	25584	25546	25546	he	5148	“ And no touching . Not unless I tell you to . That ’s the game , Nikki . You do what I say , and only what I say . Are we clear ? ”
25585	25588	25589	25589	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
25592	25597	25598	25598	he	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
25615	25623	25624	25624	His	5148	“ Or I can simply hang up . ”
25683	25688	25678	25678	I	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
25689	25701	25666	25666	I	5148	“ Good girl . You want me , do n’t you ? ”
25702	25707	25678	25678	I	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
25708	25721	25666	25666	I	5148	“ I want you , too . Does that make you wet ? ”
25722	25725	25678	25678	I	5148	“ Yes … ”
25778	25843	25861	25861	my	5148	“ Put your phone on speaker and leave it on the seat beside you . Then lift up your skirt and sit back down . I want your naked ass on the leather . I want you wet and slippery on that seat , so that when I get in that limo later tonight , I can lose myself in the scent of you . ”
25844	25849	25850	25850	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
25889	25902	25903	25903	His	5148	“ Spread your legs and gather your skirt up around your waist . ”
25919	25947	25908	25908	His	5148	“ Lean back against the seat and close your eyes . Now leave one hand on the seat , but put the other just above your knee . ”
25956	25961	25962	25962	he	5148	“ Move your thumb , ”
25965	25986	25962	25962	he	5148	“ Move it slowly , back and forth . Gentle , baby . So gently . Are you doing it ? ”
25987	25992	26067	26067	his	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
25993	25999	25962	25962	he	5148	“ Are your eyes closed ? ”
26000	26005	26067	26067	his	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
26006	26047	25962	25962	he	5148	“ That ’s me you feel . My hand on your leg . My finger stroking your skin . It ’s soft , and you look so beautiful spread out wide for me . Do you want me , Nikki ? ”
26048	26051	26067	26067	his	5148	“ Yes . ”
26052	26057	25962	25962	he	5148	“ Yes , what ? ”
26079	26084	26144	26144	His	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
26085	26127	26144	26144	His	5148	“ I want to touch your breasts , Nikki . I want to touch your nipples . I want to lower my mouth and suck until you come without me even touching your clit . Do you want that , Nikki ? ”
26132	26143	26144	26144	His	5148	“ Only if you touch me there later , sir . ”
26175	26191	26144	26144	His	5148	“ I ’m hard , Nikki . You ’re torturing me , you know that ? ”
26192	26208	26144	26144	His	5148	“ I hope so , sir , because you ’re sure as hell torturing me . ”
26209	26214	26215	26215	he	5148	“ Unzip your dress , ”
26218	26246	26247	26247	he	5148	“ Then take the hand that ’s on the seat and lift it to your mouth . Suck on your forefinger , baby . That ’s right , ”
26266	26280	26287	26287	his	5148	“ That ’s good . Use your tongue . Suck hard , baby . ”
26308	26324	26287	26287	his	5148	“ Slide your hand into your bodice and touch your nipple . Is it hard ? ”
26325	26328	26287	26287	his	5148	“ Yes . ”
26329	26333	26334	26334	he	5148	“ Stroke it , ”
26337	26363	26334	26334	he	5148	“ Just a tease . So light , like a butterfly kiss . Do you feel it , baby ? Is it making you wetter ? ”
26364	26367	26368	26368	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
26371	26397	26334	26334	he	5148	“ Now move the hand on your leg . Slowly — I want it to build . Do you feel it ? That soft stroke ? ”
26398	26401	26402	26402	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
26423	26467	26411	26411	he	5148	“ That ’s me . My hands . I ’m right there . My hands on you . On both your legs . Can you feel me , stroking the inside of your thighs , teasing you , making you hotter and wetter ? ”
26564	26571	26557	26557	Damien	5148	“ Oh , God , yes . ”
26572	26578	26579	26579	he	5148	“ Spread your legs more , ”
26582	26606	26579	26579	he	5148	“ I want you wide open , your cunt hot and dripping for me . Do you want to touch yourself , Nikki ? ”
26607	26610	26611	26611	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
26641	26645	26646	26646	he	5148	“ Not yet , ”
26671	26680	26698	26699	A masochist	935	“ You ’re a sadist , Mr. Stark . ”
26681	26697	26698	26699	A masochist	935	“ And you comply so willingly , Ms. Fairchild . What does that make you ? ”
26717	26721	26722	26722	I	5148	“ Turned on , ”
26725	26731	26698	26699	A masochist	935	“ We are deliciously compatible . ”
26732	26738	26739	26739	I	5148	“ When telecommunications are involved , ”
26744	26768	26698	26699	A masochist	935	“ Always . Do n’t argue , Ms. Fairchild , or the game stops now . And that really would be a shame . ”
26773	26776	26777	26777	he	5148	“ Good , ”
26780	26803	26804	26804	he	5148	“ I like you compliant . I like you spread wide and ready for me . I like you wet for me , ”
26816	26835	26804	26804	he	5148	“ Put your hands on the seat on either side of your hips . Have you done it ? ”
26836	26840	26804	26804	he	5148	“ I have . ”
26846	26854	26804	26804	he	5148	“ I mean , yes , sir . ”
26919	26928	26896	26896	he	5148	“ No touching , Nikki . Not yet . ”
26929	26944	26896	26896	he	5148	“ How did you — oh , God , are there cameras in here ? ”
26954	26957	26958	26958	he	5148	“ No , ”
26962	26981	26958	26958	he	5148	“ Though at the moment I wish there were . Let ’s just call it a lucky guess . ”
27011	27029	26896	26896	he	5148	“ You ’re keeping me from an excellent Scotch and some very tasty appetizers , you know . ”
27030	27039	27040	27040	I	5148	“ I ’m not the least bit sorry , ”
27043	27063	27040	27040	I	5148	“ But if you ’re in a hurry , I know how we can finish this off real quick . ”
27064	27076	26896	26896	he	5148	“ Is that what you want ? This to be over ? ”
27077	27082	27083	27083	I	5148	“ I — no , ”
27097	27110	26896	26896	he	5148	“ Did you notice the bar when you got into the limo ? ”
27111	27114	26896	26896	he	5148	“ Yes . ”
27115	27146	26896	26896	he	5148	“ I want you to move long enough to open the ice bucket and take out an ice cube . Then back here , spread wide and open for me . ”
27147	27152	26896	26896	he	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
27242	27248	27225	27225	I	5148	“ Are you settled again ? ”
27249	27252	27352	27352	his	5148	“ Yes . ”
27253	27261	27225	27225	I	5148	“ Which hand has the ice cube ? ”
27262	27267	27352	27352	his	5148	“ My right one . ”
27268	27334	27225	27225	I	5148	“ Pull down the left strap of your dress until your breast is free . Close your eyes and trace the cube around your areola . Do n’t touch your nipple , not yet . That ’s it . I can imagine your skin , soft and perfect and puckered from the cold . I ’m hard , baby , I want to touch you . ”
27335	27341	27342	27342	I	5148	“ You are touching me , ”
27345	27348	27352	27352	his	5148	“ Yes . ”

27442	27452	27453	27453	I	5148	“ I ’m imagining you licking the droplets off , ”
27456	27508	27453	27453	I	5148	“ Your tongue flicking over my hard nipple . Teasing me until you ca n’t stand it , and then you nip it , your teeth grazing before you suck , hard , so hard until it ’s like a hot wire runs through me all the way to my clit . ”
27509	27512	27513	27513	he	5148	“ Jesus , ”
27519	27525	27513	27513	he	5148	“ Whose game is this ? ”
27526	27532	27533	27533	I	5148	“ I like to win , ”
27566	27569	27570	27570	I	5148	“ Damien , ”

27584	27616	27570	27570	I	5148	“ One finger . I ’m taking one finger and sliding it over your cunt . Your wet , dripping cunt . You ’re throbbing , you want me so badly . ”
27617	27620	27621	27621	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
27624	27629	27570	27570	I	5148	“ Are you wet ? ”
27630	27635	27570	27570	I	5148	“ I ’m drenched . ”
27636	27644	27645	27645	he	5148	“ I want to be inside you , ”
27710	27716	27717	27717	he	5148	“ You broke the rules , ”
27746	27754	27743	27743	his	5148	“ Rules are made to be broken . ”
27763	27795	27743	27743	his	5148	“ Of course they are . If you ’re willing to accept the punishment . Shall I punish you , Nikki ? Shall I bend you over and spank your ass ? ”
27796	27799	27800	27800	I	5148	“ I — ”
27836	27856	27881	27881	I	5148	“ Or maybe I should make you pull your hands away . Leave you hungry . Leave you wanting . ”
27857	27861	27862	27862	I	5148	“ Please no , ”
27865	27869	27870	27870	he	5148	“ I should , ”
27873	27880	27870	27870	he	5148	“ I should leave you hanging . ”
27972	27975	27976	27976	he	5148	“ Beg , ”
27979	27982	27960	27960	He	5148	“ Please . ”
27983	27988	27960	27960	He	5148	“ Please , what ? ”
27989	27994	27960	27960	He	5148	“ Please , sir . ”
27995	28004	27960	27960	He	5148	“ Is that the best you can do ? ”
28005	28050	28051	28051	I	5148	“ I want to come , Damien . I want to come with your voice taking me there , and I ’m so close right now I think if this limo goes over a pothole it might just send me shooting to the moon . ”
28092	28098	28105	28105	his	5148	“ Are you touching yourself ? ”
28116	28119	28105	28105	his	5148	“ Yes . ”
28120	28131	28132	28132	he	5148	“ I want to taste you . Lick your fingers , ”
28149	28153	28132	28132	he	5148	“ Tell me . ”
28154	28157	28158	28158	I	5148	“ Slick , ”
28161	28171	28158	28158	I	5148	“ Sweet . But , Damien , I want — ”
28172	28234	28132	28132	he	5148	“ Hush , baby , I know . And I ’m touching you now . I ’m kneeling right in front of you , and you ’re wide open to me . You ’re wet and delicious , and my tongue is all over you , touching and tasting . Can you feel me flicking my tongue over your hard clit ? ”
28235	28238	28239	28239	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
28251	28282	28132	28132	he	5148	“ You taste so good , and I ’m so hard . I want to be inside you , but I ca n’t get enough of the taste of you . ”
28283	28288	28289	28289	I	5148	“ Do n’t stop . ”
28308	28311	28312	28312	he	5148	“ Never , ”
28315	28358	28312	28312	he	5148	“ But I need you to come for me now , baby . We ’re close now , and it ’s time . I ’m touching you , I ’m taking you over . Now , Nikki . Come for me now . ”
28403	28410	28411	28411	he	5148	“ Oh , yes , baby , ”
28422	28427	28411	28411	he	5148	“ That ’s it . ”
28518	28523	28524	28524	Damien	5148	“ We ’re here , ”
28638	28648	28649	28649	he	939	“ I ’ll see you tomorrow , Ms. Fairchild , ”
28665	28675	28676	28676	I	5148	“ I look forward to it , Mr. Stark , ”
28712	28719	28720	28720	he	939	“ Hang up , Ms. Fairchild , ”
28723	28728	28729	28729	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
29640	29644	29645	29645	I	5148	“ You okay ? ”
29684	29694	29695	29695	She	294	“ I ’m good . Must ’ve fallen asleep . ”
29752	29755	29756	29756	she	294	“ So ? ”
29800	29803	29804	29804	I	5148	“ Tired , ”
29837	29867	29868	29868	I	5148	“ Wanna grab breakfast at Du - par ’s in the morning ? I ’ll give you the full scoop then . But it ’ll have to be early . ”
29876	29883	29868	29868	I	5148	“ I need to go crash . ”
29884	29903	29916	29916	She	294	“ You ’re really not going to tell me shit ? Why the hell did I wait up ? ”
29904	29915	29868	29868	I	5148	“ You did n’t wait up . You were asleep . ”
29928	29933	29934	29934	I	5148	“ In the morning , ”
30228	30233	30234	30234	I	5148	“ Is that Douglas ? ”
30239	30243	30244	30244	she	974	“ Hell no , ”
30247	30255	30234	30234	I	5148	“ I train them better than that . ”
30256	30260	30244	30244	she	974	“ Then who — ”
30261	30266	30267	30267	she	974	“ Oh , fuck , ”
30280	30291	30267	30267	she	974	“ Nik , honey , get your ass out here . ”
30527	30540	30541	30541	Jamie	1450	“ Just how good a time did you have at that party ? ”
30544	30549	30550	30550	I	5148	“ Not the party , ”
30572	30577	30578	30578	I	5148	“ The ride home . ”
30627	30634	30635	30635	Jamie	1450	“ No , you do n’t , ”
30674	30719	30663	30663	She	983	“ Do n’t even think of claiming you ’re sleepy . You ca n’t drop a bombshell like that and not explain . The ride home ? So , what ? You guys went up and parked on Mulholland for some late night delight ? ”
30720	30729	30730	30730	I	5148	“ He sent me home in a limo , ”
30742	30745	30730	30730	I	5148	“ Alone . ”
30746	30755	30756	30756	she	983	“ You are such a liar . Seriously ? ”
30776	30785	30764	30764	I	5148	“ It was one hell of a ride . ”
30786	30793	30794	30794	Her	983	“ Oh . My . God . ”
30799	30840	30794	30794	Her	983	“ Okay , spill . And do n’t give me any of that bullshit about privacy or being discreet or a lady does n’t tell . You ’re not your mother . I want the dirt . All of it . ”
30881	30890	30891	30891	Jamie	1450	“ I have n’t seen Ollie in ages , ”
30894	30905	30891	30891	Jamie	1450	“ The little shit . Why has n’t he called ? ”
30991	30995	30996	30996	she	983	“ Holy fuck , ”
31015	31025	31026	31026	I	5148	“ And I left the panties in the car , ”
31049	31053	31054	31054	she	983	“ Holy fuck , ”
31064	31086	31054	31054	she	983	“ So he was really in a restaurant the whole time ? God , he must have some serious blue balls . ”
31108	31131	31087	31087	I	5148	“ How did he get flowers to me so fast ? I was probably home less than ten minutes before they arrived . ”
31148	31152	31087	31087	I	5148	“ Who cares ? ”
31184	31195	31196	31196	Jamie	1450	“ You need to toss some condoms in your purse , ”
31199	31203	31196	31196	Jamie	1450	“ I what ? ”
31204	31247	31248	31248	Her	987	“ I ’ve got a box in the bathroom . Take a few . Phone sex is the only safe sex there is , girlfriend , and he may be hot , but you do n’t know where that boy ’s been . ”
31255	31263	31248	31248	Her	987	“ Or who he ’s been in . ”
31305	31312	31313	31313	I	5148	“ I do n’t need condoms , ”
31316	31325	31313	31313	I	5148	“ because I ’m not sleeping with him . ”
31326	31329	31330	31330	she	987	“ Nikki , ”
31357	31362	31363	31363	I	5148	“ Do n’t start , ”
31366	31372	31363	31363	I	5148	“ I ’m not you . ”
31373	31388	31389	31389	She	987	“ Which is good , as the world can only take so much awesomeness . ”
31416	31438	31406	31406	her	987	“ Look , you know I love you , and I ’ll always be on your side , no matter what . ”
31439	31442	31406	31406	her	987	“ But ? ”
31443	31454	31406	31406	her	987	“ But think about why you came to Los Angeles . ”
31455	31461	31462	31462	I	5148	“ I came for business . ”
31522	31553	31564	31565	new Nikki	5143	“ Yeah , yeah , whatever . I ’m talking about Damien Stark . You could do a lot worse than him if you ’re looking for a fresh start . ”
31579	31584	31585	31585	I	5148	“ Not going there , ”
31589	31625	31585	31585	I	5148	“ The limo was amazing , but it was on my terms . In person , all I ’d be is a notch on his bedpost , and that ’s your gig , not mine . ”
31626	31644	31564	31565	new Nikki	5143	“ Ha ! Well , you nailed me . But the rest of it is total bullshit . ”
31645	31649	31585	31585	I	5148	“ Excuse me ? ”
31650	31665	31666	31666	I	5148	“ You do n’t want him putting his hands all over you , fine . ”
31680	31714	31715	31715	She	992	“ But own up to it , Nik . Because I was n’t even at that party and I can tell that he thinks of you as more than a piece of ass . ”
31721	31724	31715	31715	She	992	“ Exhibit A. ”
31725	31766	31767	31767	I	5148	“ So he ’s a polite bazillionaire . It ’s not like delivering flowers took more than a phone call . They probably came fast because he has a standing order for flower delivery after all his phone sex encounters . ”
31791	31832	31715	31715	She	992	“ No way . He wants you . Your snark . Your attitude . I mean , he flat out told you that you ’re not like the usual women on his arm . I Googled him , you know . ”
31840	31847	31833	31833	I	5148	“ You did not . When ? ”
31848	31916	31962	31962	she	994	“ After you told me he was bringing you home . He ’s pretty private — I did n’t find a lot and to be honest I did n’t try very hard . But it does n’t look like he dates that much . Lots of women , sure , but nobody serious except for this one socialite a few months ago , but she ’s dead . ”
31917	31924	31833	31833	I	5148	“ Dead ? Shit . How ? ”
31925	31945	31962	31962	she	994	“ I know . Sad , right ? Some sort of accident . But that ’s not the point . ”
31951	31957	31946	31946	My	5148	“ What is the point ? ”
31958	31961	31962	31962	she	994	“ You , ”
31965	31989	31962	31962	she	994	“ I mean , even if you are just a notch on his bedpost , so what ? You ’re not a nun . ”
32021	32042	31994	31994	she	994	“ And honestly , I do n’t think you ’re just a notch . I think he really likes you . ”
32048	32068	32043	32043	I	5148	“ And you base this on your extensive knowledge of the man gleaned from five minutes on the Internet ? ”
32069	32079	32080	32080	she	994	“ I gleaned it from what you told me , ”
32083	32147	32080	32080	she	994	“ He wanted your opinion on a painting . He got all alpha male on Ollie ’s ass . He made you come , for Christ ’s sake . And let ’s not forget the foot massage . Holy crap , girl , I ’d totally fuck a guy who gave me a foot massage . Hell , I ’d probably marry him . ”
32163	32173	32174	32174	she	994	“ Not every guy is an asshole like Kurt , ”
32186	32200	32174	32174	she	994	“ You ca n’t keep pretending you ’re wearing a damn chastity belt . ”
32204	32211	32201	32201	I	5148	“ Just drop it . Please . ”
32223	32226	32212	32212	She	994	“ Dammit . ”
32300	32304	32292	32292	She	994	“ Want some ? ”
32324	32329	32330	32330	I	5148	“ I ’m tired , ”
32340	32352	32330	32330	I	5148	“ I ’m really sorry . You know I would n’t — ”
32353	32357	32358	32358	I	5148	“ I know , ”
32361	32373	32358	32358	I	5148	“ And it ’s really okay . I just need sleep . ”
32390	32414	32382	32382	I	5148	“ I guess so . You have a meeting tomorrow , do n’t you ? And who ’s that meeting with , exactly ? ”
32415	32423	32424	32424	I	5148	“ Give it a rest , Jamie , ”
32610	32613	32614	32614	His	5148	“ Hush . ”
32625	32628	32629	32629	I	5148	“ Please , ”
32721	32724	32725	32725	I	5148	“ Please , ”
32743	32748	32749	32749	he	5148	“ You ’re mine , ”
32801	32804	32805	32805	he	5148	“ Mine , ”
33005	33009	33021	33021	Jamie	1450	“ — awake ? ”
33025	33034	33021	33021	Jamie	1450	“ What ? I ’m sorry , what ? ”
33054	33077	33050	33050	Jamie	1450	“ I said , ‘ Are you awake ? ’ Because if you are , you need to answer your damn phone . ”
33175	33180	33181	33181	I	5148	“ I ’m here , ”
33184	33194	33181	33181	I	5148	“ I was just about to call you back . ”
33195	33206	33143	33143	I	5148	“ Jesus Christ , Fairchild . Where ’ve you been ? ”
33207	33218	33181	33181	I	5148	“ It ’s practically dawn . I was in bed . ”
33219	33303	33143	33143	I	5148	“ Well , get down here . We ’ve got a shitload of work to do . I ca n’t get the fucking PowerPoint to work right , and we need to print out PDFs of the specs and get the proposal packages bound for Stark and his staff . I need you on it , pronto . Unless you already signed him to the deal last night ? Or was there a nonbusiness purpose for his late night phone call to you ? ”
33335	33346	33347	33347	I	5148	“ He called to make sure I got home okay , ”
33350	33372	33347	33347	I	5148	“ But next time I ’d appreciate it if you did n’t give out my cell number without asking me first . ”
33373	33401	33402	33402	I	5148	“ Yeah , yeah . Whatever . Get dressed and get down here . We ’ll go from our office to Stark ’s at one - thirty . ”
33445	33453	33454	33455	A snail	1008	“ Is n’t the meeting at two ? ”
33474	33483	33484	33484	Carl	2664	“ I ’m not leaving anything to chance , ”
33494	33505	33487	33487	I	5148	“ I ’ll be there in an hour . Tops . ”
33523	33529	33506	33506	Jamie	1450	“ Boss on a rampage ? ”
33530	33534	33535	33535	I	5148	“ Big time . ”
33552	33569	33535	33535	I	5148	“ And he was being oh so snarky about Damien asking me to stay last night . ”
33570	33588	33535	33535	I	5148	“ Um , hello ? You did get off in the backseat of Mr. Moneybags ’s limousine . ”
34465	34472	34473	34473	Carl	2664	“ What are you grinning about ? ”
34524	34554	34510	34510	He	2664	“ Good . Good . You look professional , businesslike . Yeah . I ’d give you money . So long as you do n’t screw up the slideshow . ”
34555	34560	34561	34561	I	5148	“ I wo n’t , ”
34928	34935	34936	34936	he	2664	“ We ’re doing this right , ”
34939	34954	34936	34936	he	2664	“ No fuck - ups . No slips . A well - oiled ship . ”
34962	34999	34955	34955	He	2664	“ Go order up some sandwiches for lunch , but I swear to God , if anyone goes to that meeting with mustard on their shirt , I am firing his ass right then and there . ”
35156	35159	35151	35151	he	5148	“ phone . ”
35161	35164	35151	35151	he	5148	“ ice . ”
35220	35225	35226	35227	the guard	1050	“ All checked in , ”
35236	35244	35245	35245	he	1050	“ You ’re cleared to the penthouse , ”
35255	35259	35260	35260	Carl	2664	“ The penthouse ? ”
35263	35272	35260	35260	Carl	2664	“ Our meeting ’s at Stark Applied Technology . ”
35370	35378	35379	35379	Joe	305	“ Yup , all the way up , ”
35385	35418	35379	35379	Joe	305	“ On Saturdays , Mr. Stark takes meetings in the penthouse conference room . Use the last elevator bank on the end . Here ’s your card key to access the penthouse . ”
35745	35749	35750	35750	she	1064	“ Mr. Rosenfeld , ”
35758	35794	35750	35750	she	1064	“ I ’m Ms. Peters , Mr. Stark ’s weekend assistant . I ’d like to welcome you and your team to the penthouse . Mr. Stark is very much looking forward to your presentation . ”
35795	35799	35800	35800	Carl	2664	“ Thank you , ”
35982	35987	35988	35988	she	0	“ You ’re right , ”
35991	36027	35988	35988	she	0	“ The office area of the penthouse takes up only half the square footage . The rest of the space constitutes one of Mr. Stark ’s private residences . We call it the Tower Apartment . ”
36028	36031	36032	36032	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
36072	36110	36111	36111	She	0	“ It ’s fully stocked . Help yourself to orange juice , coffee , water , soda . Or if you need it to calm your nerves , you ’re more than welcome to have something stronger . ”
36146	36155	36156	36157	Ms. Peters	0	“ I ’ll leave you to set up , ”
36160	36187	36156	36157	Ms. Peters	0	“ If you need anything , just buzz me . Mr. Stark is finishing a call . I expect he ’ll join you in ten minutes . ”
36420	36456	36457	36457	He	5148	“ Thank you all for meeting here . On the weekends I like to work out of the penthouse . The change of pace reminds me that it ’s time to kick back a little . ”
37272	37296	37262	37263	Ms. Peters	0	“ I apologize for interrupting , Mr. Stark , but you asked me to inform you if Mr. Padgett returned to the building . ”
37297	37303	37304	37304	I	5148	“ He ’s here now ? ”
37320	37336	37262	37263	Ms. Peters	0	“ Security just called up . I assume you ’d like to speak to them ? ”
37346	37374	37337	37337	Stark	5148	“ I ’m afraid you ’ll have to excuse me . There ’s a situation that demands my attention . I ’ll be in touch next week . ”
37381	37390	37375	37375	He	5148	“ If you could see our guests out ? ”
37391	37397	37378	37379	Ms. Peters	0	“ Of course , sir . ”
37500	37505	37506	37506	I	5148	“ That was great , ”
37509	37522	37506	37506	I	5148	“ Thank you so much for letting me be here for this . ”
37532	37547	37523	37523	Carl	2664	“ Hey , we ’re a team . And we all kicked some ass . ”
37612	37622	37623	37623	He	305	“ Ms. Fairchild ? If you have a moment ? ”
37632	37635	37636	37636	I	5148	“ Yes ? ”
37701	37709	37687	37687	Joe	305	“ You ’re wanted upstairs , ma’am . ”
37710	37713	37687	37687	Joe	305	“ Upstairs ? ”
37714	37720	37721	37721	he	305	“ Back in the penthouse , ”
37724	37733	37721	37721	he	305	“ Mr. Stark would like to see you . ”
37767	37775	37776	37776	I	5148	“ Now ’s not a good time , ”
37781	37792	37776	37776	I	5148	“ I ’m on my way to a team meeting . ”
37793	37800	37803	37803	he	305	“ Mr. Stark was very insistent . ”
37859	37895	37842	37842	I	5148	“ I ’m sure he ’ll find something else to occupy his time this afternoon . But if he calls my office , I ’ll be happy to work him into my schedule next week . ”
37952	37956	37957	37957	I	5148	“ Shall we ? ”
37968	37972	37965	37965	Carl	2664	“ Maybe you — ”
37973	37976	37977	37977	I	5148	“ No , ”
37980	37997	37977	37977	I	5148	“ If he wants to talk about the project , we can all go back up . ”
38016	38031	38032	38032	Carl	2664	“ And if it ’s not the project he wants to see you about ? ”
38048	38061	38040	38040	I	5148	“ Then he does n’t need to see me , does he ? ”
38111	38119	38108	38108	he	2664	“ Come on . Champagne ’s waiting . ”
38141	38154	38155	38155	he	2664	“ I ’m going to need to call Mr. Stark ’s office , ”
38158	38165	38155	38155	he	2664	“ He ’s expecting you upstairs . ”
38166	38174	38182	38183	the man	225	“ It ’s all right , Joe . ”
38266	38270	38271	38271	he	2664	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
38284	38310	38271	38271	he	2664	“ My decorator sent over some portfolio pages from local artists . I was hoping to get your opinion on a few of the pieces . ”
38311	38322	38323	38323	Carl	2664	“ You did n’t find something you liked last night ? ”
38326	38333	38334	38334	Stark	5148	“ I would n’t say that , ”
38342	38350	38334	38334	Stark	5148	“ But I ’m still not satisfied . ”
38376	38402	38334	38334	Stark	5148	“ I apologize for the short notice — you probably have a team meeting planned?—but I ’d like to get this matter put to bed . ”
38413	38417	38418	38418	Carl	2664	“ No plans , ”
38426	38450	38418	38418	Carl	2664	“ It ’s Saturday . I was just about to wish everyone a good weekend and congratulate them on a job well done . ”
38451	38464	38465	38465	He	2664	“ Then you do n’t mind if I steal Ms. Fairchild again . ”
38496	38501	38502	38502	Carl	2664	“ Not at all , ”
38505	38515	38502	38502	Carl	2664	“ I ’m sure she ’ll be very helpful . ”
38724	38733	38734	38734	I	5148	“ What do you think you ’re doing ? ”
38737	38741	38742	38742	Stark	5148	“ Hold on , ”
38751	38774	38781	38781	I	5148	“ No , I ’m not holding on . You do n’t get to just snap your fingers and expect me to — ”
38828	38836	38837	38837	he	5148	“ I meant hold on to something , ”
38840	38860	38837	38837	he	5148	“ This is my private elevator . It goes straight to the penthouse , and it goes there quickly . ”
38861	38864	38865	38865	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
38959	38963	38964	38964	I	5148	“ He knows , ”
38973	38994	38964	38964	I	5148	“ Dammit , Stark , you ca n’t just waltz into the lobby and pluck me up like a flower . ”
38995	39022	38964	38964	I	5148	“ Speaking of , I hope you liked the flowers . I had considered something more exotic , but you remind me of daisies and wildflowers . ”
39023	39030	38964	38964	I	5148	“ That ’s not the point . ”
39031	39034	39035	39035	His	5148	“ What ? ”
39042	39070	39035	39035	His	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild , I ’m surprised . Such a well - bred young lady , and you do n’t even say a simple thank - you ? ”
39071	39075	39076	39076	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
39080	39107	39076	39076	I	5148	“ And for the record , I did n’t pluck you . Though I would be more than happy to remedy that oversight anytime you wish . ”
39124	39141	39142	39142	I	5148	“ I do n’t appreciate being treated like a puppy who ’s been told to heel , ”
39154	39161	39142	39142	I	5148	“ Is that what you think ? ”
39162	39165	39168	39168	I	5148	“ I — ”
39207	39210	39211	39211	I	5148	“ No , ”
39216	39227	39228	39228	I	5148	“ I do n’t know . But dammit , Damien , ”
39242	39252	39228	39228	I	5148	“ think about how it looks . He knows . ”
39253	39282	39283	39283	He	5148	“ So you said . Carl , you mean ? And what exactly does your boss know ? I assure you that I did n’t tell him anything . ”
39301	39307	39283	39283	He	5148	“ Did you say something ? ”
39308	39314	39315	39315	I	5148	“ Do n’t be obtuse , ”
39318	39329	39315	39315	I	5148	“ He knows that something is going on between us . ”
39330	39343	39283	39283	He	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear you say that something is . ”
39344	39347	39348	39348	I	5148	“ Went , ”
39352	39360	39348	39348	I	5148	“ That something went on between us . ”
39388	39396	39383	39383	I	5148	“ It , um , was fun , ”
39411	39414	39383	39383	I	5148	“ Fun ? ”
39435	39438	39422	39422	He	5148	“ Yes , ”
39443	39480	39439	39439	I	5148	“ Fun . A lot of fun , actually . A rollicking good time that I will probably replay over and over again as I lay in my bed alone and touch myself until I come . ”
39535	39538	39539	39539	I	5148	“ Fun , ”
39546	39554	39539	39539	I	5148	“ But it ’s not happening again . ”
39555	39560	39561	39561	He	5148	“ Is n’t it ? ”
39581	39584	39585	39585	I	5148	“ No , ”
39655	39658	39659	39659	I	5148	“ No , ”
39700	39704	39705	39705	He	5148	“ Why not ? ”
39757	39765	39769	39769	he	5148	“ This is n’t a good idea , ”
39901	39907	39908	39908	I	5148	“ Your home is beautiful , ”
39911	39923	39908	39908	I	5148	“ It tells a lot about the man who lives here . ”
39924	39928	39978	39978	Valet	313	“ Does it ? ”
39929	39934	39908	39908	I	5148	“ He likes flowers . ”
39938	39943	39935	39935	Stark	5148	“ He likes beauty . ”
39944	39953	39978	39978	Valet	313	“ Did you pick out the floral arrangement ? ”
39954	39957	39958	39958	he	5148	“ No , ”
39961	39968	39958	39958	he	5148	“ Though Gregory knows my taste . ”
39969	39972	39978	39978	Valet	313	“ Gregory ? ”
39973	39977	39958	39958	he	5148	“ My valet . ”
40005	40024	39978	39978	Valet	313	“ The painting is beautiful . But I ’m surprised to see a pastoral scene in your home . ”
40025	40029	40030	40030	He	5148	“ Are you ? ”
40035	40038	40030	40030	He	5148	“ Why ? ”
40039	40052	40053	40053	I	5148	“ You ’re so intent on a nude for your new place . ”
40056	40073	40053	40053	I	5148	“ I just would n’t have pegged you for flowers and trees and all that stuff . ”
40074	40082	40083	40083	he	5148	“ I ’m a man of mystery , ”
40086	40139	40083	40083	he	5148	“ But to be honest , the decision to hang a nude in the Malibu property is a relatively new one . You might say that inspiration struck me at Blaine ’s show . Of course , unless I ’m able to acquire what I want , the wall will stay bare . ”
40172	40185	40186	40186	I	5148	“ Did you have some portfolio pages you wanted to show me ? ”
40198	40215	40186	40186	I	5148	“ If not , I should be going . I ’d like to enjoy my Saturday . ”
40216	40228	40229	40229	he	5148	“ I ’d be happy to suggest some very engaging activities , ”
40243	40254	40232	40232	I	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild . How your thoughts do wander . … ”
40269	40274	40275	40275	he	5148	“ Come on in , ”
40299	40311	40285	40285	He	5148	“ I ’ll make you a drink and we can talk . ”
40485	40491	40492	40492	Damien	5148	“ I like your smile , ”
40501	40508	40492	40492	Damien	5148	“ What are you thinking about ? ”
40517	40525	40526	40526	he	5148	“ I ’ve never thought about it , ”
40529	40546	40547	40547	His	5148	“ But I promise to keep you fully tethered to me . No sailing into space . ”
40552	40564	40547	40547	His	5148	“ Not unless it ’s me who ’s sending you there . ”
40589	40592	40593	40593	he	5148	“ Wine ? ”
40601	40607	40596	40596	I	5148	“ I ’d prefer bourbon . ”
40608	40612	40596	40596	I	5148	“ Would you ? ”
40622	40656	40613	40613	I	5148	“ My mother used to pound into my head that a proper lady only drinks wine or feminine mixed cocktails . Never hard liquor . My grandfather was a whiskey kind of guy . ”
40657	40661	40662	40662	he	5148	“ I see , ”
40680	40690	40691	40691	He	5148	“ I think I may have just the thing . ”
40754	40758	40759	40759	I	5148	“ Glen Garioch ? ”
40800	40806	40807	40807	I	5148	“ What year is this ? ”
40818	40824	40825	40825	he	5148	“ Nineteen fifty - eight , ”
40829	40836	40825	40825	he	5148	“ Excellent , is n’t it ? ”
40837	40847	40851	40852	my grandfather	645	“ Nineteen fifty - eight ? Are you serious ? ”
40921	40930	40969	40969	he	5148	“ You ’re familiar with this particular label ? ”
40931	40934	40935	40935	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
40938	40945	40935	40935	I	5148	“ Basically we ’re drinking gold . ”
40946	40957	40969	40969	he	5148	“ Why would I offer you anything but my best ? ”
41070	41075	41076	41076	I	5148	“ You ’re staring , ”
41080	41085	41076	41076	I	5148	“ You ’re beautiful . ”
41099	41104	41105	41105	I	5148	“ I ’m not , ”
41108	41118	41105	41105	I	5148	“ Or maybe I am . Does it matter ? ”
41119	41122	41123	41123	he	5148	“ Sometimes , ”
41141	41147	41123	41123	he	5148	“ It matters to me . ”
41148	41151	41123	41123	he	5148	“ Why ? ”
41152	41184	41123	41123	he	5148	“ Because I like looking at you . I like the way you hold your shoulders back . The way you walk as if the world is yours for the taking . ”
41192	41217	41185	41185	I	5148	“ That ’s just years of walking with a book on my head , and lectures from my mother , and endless etiquette classes . ”
41218	41282	41123	41123	he	5148	“ It ’s more than that . I like the way you wear your clothes , as if you understand that it ’s you and not the cloth that matters . You are beautiful , Nikki , but it ’s because of what you exude as much as it is the standard of beauty that we see in pageants and on magazine covers . ”
41283	41295	41185	41185	I	5148	“ What if everything you see in me is a lie ? ”
41296	41301	41302	41302	he	5148	“ It ’s not , ”
41313	41329	41305	41305	I	5148	“ Maybe you ’re not as smart as you think you are , Mr. Stark . ”
41330	41344	41345	41345	His	5148	“ Nonsense . I ’m fucking brilliant . Or have n’t you heard ? ”
41431	41438	41439	41439	he	5148	“ I am smart , Nikki , ”
41442	41475	41439	41439	he	5148	“ I ’m smart enough to know that you feel it , too . This is n’t just heat , it ’s a goddamned conflagration . Not chemistry , but nuclear fission . ”
41499	41509	41510	41510	I	5148	“ There ’s nothing good about an atomic reaction , ”
41513	41522	41510	41510	I	5148	“ And the blast destroys everything it touches . ”
41523	41526	41533	41533	He	5148	“ Bullshit . ”
41553	41586	41533	41533	He	5148	“ Goddammit , Nikki , do n’t do that . Do n’t play those kind of games with me . Do n’t make this complicated when it should be so damn simple . ”
41587	41591	41592	41592	I	5148	“ Should be ? ”
41595	41624	41592	41592	I	5148	“ What the hell does that mean ? Nothing is simple . Am I attracted to you ? Hell yes . But you do n’t even know me . ”
41714	41721	41722	41722	I	5148	“ You do n’t know me , ”
41739	41744	41729	41729	he	5143	“ But I do . ”
41806	41820	41794	41794	I	5148	“ We ’re not taking this further , Mr. Stark . Absolutely not . ”
41821	41828	41829	41829	His	5143	“ I do n’t accept that . ”
41859	41864	41865	41865	he	5143	“ I liked it , ”
41880	41898	41865	41865	he	5143	“ You liked it . I ’m not seeing a sound basis for cessation , Ms. Fairchild . ”
41908	41929	41899	41899	I	5148	“ I like cheesecake , but I only have it rarely . And I know it ’s bad for me . ”
41930	41936	41865	41865	he	5143	“ Sometimes bad is good . ”
41937	41963	41899	41899	I	5148	“ Bullshit . That ’s what people say to alleviate their own guilt or justify their own weakness . Bad is bad . A is A. ”
41964	41992	41993	41993	His	5143	“ I did n’t realize we were discussing philosophy . Shall I counter with the teachings of Aristippus ? He held that pleasure is the highest good . ”
41999	42012	41993	41993	His	5143	“ And I want to be very , very good with you . ”
42056	42063	42044	42044	I	5148	“ This is n’t going anywhere . ”
42078	42083	42070	42070	My	5148	“ It ca n’t . ”
42084	42088	42089	42089	I	5148	“ Why not ? ”
42129	42146	42114	42114	He	5143	“ Ultimately , your free will is your own , Ms. Fairchild . As is mine . ”
42147	42150	42114	42114	He	5143	“ Yours ? ”
42151	42162	42114	42114	He	5143	“ I ’m free to try to convince you otherwise . ”
42181	42188	42189	42189	I	5148	“ You wo n’t convince me , ”
42200	42223	42189	42189	I	5148	“ I have a job with someone you ’re going to invest with . I ’ve already gone further than I should . ”
42231	42253	42224	42224	I	5148	“ But it has to stop now . I ’m not risking my professional reputation any more than I already have . ”
42254	42261	42189	42189	I	5148	“ Why not work for me ? ”
42282	42286	42287	42287	I	5148	“ Not happening , ”
42290	42298	42224	42224	I	5148	“ Give me one reason why not . ”
42299	42323	42327	42327	his	5148	“ Um , gee , let me see . Maybe because I do n’t want to be the poster child for sexual harassment ? ”
42380	42388	42416	42416	I	5148	“ Did you feel harassed last night ? ”
42389	42392	42393	42393	I	5148	“ No , ”
42453	42461	42462	42462	he	5148	“ I thought about you last night , ”
42465	42484	42462	42462	he	5148	“ Giselle and Bruce will probably never have me out for drinks again . I was terrible company . ”
42485	42496	42546	42546	He	5148	“ I ’m so sorry to have ruined your evening . ”
42497	42500	42501	42501	he	5148	“ Hardly , ”
42504	42545	42501	42501	he	5148	“ And the ride home — I think that was the first time in my life I wanted a drive to be longer . Me , alone in the back of the limo , surrounded by the scent of you . ”
42603	42609	42610	42610	he	5148	“ I imagined undressing you , ”
42628	42634	42635	42635	Pop	318	“ I pictured you naked . ”
42640	42645	42646	42646	he	5148	“ You ’re beautiful , ”
42760	42765	42756	42756	I	5148	“ Damien , please . ”
42790	42836	42773	42773	He	5148	“ Free will , Nikki . Tell me to stop , and I will . But tell me fast , because I ’m going to kiss that damnable mouth of yours , and goddammit , Nikki , I ’m doing it to keep you quiet . ”
43198	43201	43202	43202	he	5148	“ Baby , ”
43276	43280	43281	43281	he	5148	“ So soft , ”
43324	43329	43333	43333	his	5148	“ So damn beautiful . ”
43367	43371	43372	43372	he	5148	“ Reach back , ”
43375	43382	43372	43372	he	5148	“ Hold on to the stool . ”
43383	43386	43387	43387	I	5148	“ Damien … ”
43551	43558	43559	43559	he	5148	“ Did you know you glow ? ”
43663	43667	43668	43668	he	5148	“ Turn around , ”
43750	43753	43754	43754	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
43802	43872	43786	43786	his	5148	“ I ’m going to fuck you , Nikki . Pleasure ? We ’re going to blow the roof off pleasure . I ’m going to make you beg for it . I ’m going to claim you . I ’m going to tease you . I ’m going to torment you . And you ’re going to come for me like you ’ve never come in your life . ”
43919	43925	43926	43926	he	5148	“ You ’re so wet , ”
43929	43938	43926	43926	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , you ’re soaking . ”
44019	44026	44012	44012	he	5148	“ Tell me you like that . ”
44034	44041	44042	44042	My	5148	“ Yes . God , yes . ”
44132	44135	44136	44136	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
44339	44346	44347	44347	he	5148	“ I have to taste you , ”
44350	44376	44347	44347	he	5148	“ I want to lick all of that sweetness up and then kiss you . I want you to know how fucking amazing you taste . ”
44611	44614	44615	44615	he	5148	“ Perfect , ”
44618	44628	44615	44615	he	5148	“ Dear God , Nikki , you ’re perfect . ”
44655	44664	44665	44665	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , I ’m sorry , ”
44675	44685	44668	44668	I	5148	“ I have to go . I ’m sorry . ”
44730	44733	44740	44740	his	5148	“ Nikki — ”
44782	44787	44788	44788	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
45234	45241	45226	45226	I	5148	“ no , no , no , ”
45821	45830	45819	45819	Courtney	271	“ Hello ? Hello , who is this ? ”
45888	45892	45893	45893	I	5148	“ Never mind , ”
45908	45926	45893	45893	I	5148	“ I ’m going shopping and thought you might want to meet up . But no big . ”
46234	46237	46231	46232	a man	225	“ Hello ? ”
46258	46261	46262	46262	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
46265	46270	46271	46271	I	5148	“ Who ’s there ? ”
46313	46327	46307	46307	I	5148	“ I ’m calling security . You might want to take a hike . ”
47611	47640	47603	47603	I	5148	“ Dammit , Jamie , why not just post a sign on the door inviting every whack job in the city to waltz right in and — oh . ”
47902	47907	47908	47908	I	5148	“ You ’re here , ”
47912	47917	47918	47918	he	5148	“ I ’m here , ”
47921	47924	47925	47925	I	5148	“ Right . ”
48038	48047	48024	48024	I	5148	“ So , how come you ’re here ? ”
48087	48094	48095	48095	he	5148	“ I wanted to see you , ”
48137	48142	48143	48143	I	5148	“ I ’m good , ”
48146	48151	48143	48143	I	5148	“ I went shopping . ”
48152	48163	48175	48175	He	5148	“ And what woman would n’t be good after that ? ”
48169	48174	48164	48164	I	5148	“ Stereotypical , much ? ”
48178	48187	48175	48175	He	5148	“ If the shoe fits , Ms. Fairchild . ”
48188	48191	48192	48192	I	5148	“ Mmm . ”
48243	48250	48251	48251	she	1450	“ I am so freaking late , ”
48254	48262	48263	48263	She	1450	“ I have totally got to run . ”
48270	48276	48263	48263	She	1450	“ You two be good . ”
48277	48284	48285	48285	I	5148	“ Jamie ! What the hell ? ”
48298	48306	48307	48307	she	1450	“ I ’m just going next door , ”
48310	48313	48314	48314	I	5148	“ Douglas ? ”
48356	48362	48363	48363	she	1450	“ Just a friendly chat , ”
48366	48371	48372	48372	she	1450	“ Cross my heart , ”
48421	48428	48429	48429	Damien	5148	“ We do n’t like Douglas ? ”
48432	48439	48440	48440	I	5148	“ Douglas is bad for her , ”
48450	48461	48443	48443	I	5148	“ Please tell me that ’s a concept you understand . ”
48462	48466	48467	48467	he	326	“ It is , ”
48470	48482	48467	48467	he	326	“ I ’m also familiar with a number of corollary concepts . ”
48483	48487	48443	48443	I	5148	“ Such as ? ”
48488	48513	48467	48467	he	326	“ Maybe Douglas is n’t bad for her at all . Maybe there ’s just something about him that frightens her . Or you . ”
48514	48523	48443	48443	I	5148	“ You ’re very smart , Mr. Stark . ”
48524	48528	48467	48467	he	326	“ Thank you . ”
48529	48539	48443	48443	I	5148	“ But that does n’t mean you know everything . ”
48580	48583	48584	48584	he	326	“ Nikki , ”
48596	48603	48584	48584	he	326	“ What are you afraid of ? ”
48630	48639	48640	48640	I	5148	“ I do n’t know what you mean , ”
48647	48653	48654	48654	he	326	“ Yes , you do , ”
48697	48701	48704	48704	he	326	“ You bolted . ”
48717	48723	48704	48704	he	326	“ Do I scare you ? ”
48772	48775	48776	48776	His	326	“ Nikki ? ”
48798	48801	48802	48802	I	5148	“ No , ”
48821	48825	48802	48802	I	5148	“ Then why ? ”
48826	48833	48802	48802	I	5148	“ I … I was embarrassed . ”
48834	48838	48802	48802	I	5148	“ Were you ? ”
48878	48881	48882	48882	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
48885	48914	48882	48882	I	5148	“ I said no , but then you made me so hot that I forgot myself , and when I was able to breathe again I just ran . ”
48915	48918	48923	48923	his	326	“ Bullshit . ”
48984	48995	48974	48974	He	326	“ I do n’t like seeing fear in your eyes . ”
48996	49008	48974	48974	He	326	“ You ’re going to be my knight in shining armor ? ”
49020	49033	49012	49012	his	326	“ I think I ’m a bit too tarnished for the job . ”
49041	49055	49034	49034	I	5148	“ I guess you ’ll have to be a dark knight , then . ”
49056	49067	49068	49068	he	326	“ I ’ll fight whatever dragons you want me to , ”
49079	49100	49068	49068	he	326	“ But you do n’t need a knight . You ’re strong , Nikki . Hell , you ’re exceptional . ”
49109	49123	49101	49101	I	5148	“ Is that a line you give to all the women you date ? ”
49124	49127	49128	49128	I	5148	“ Date ? ”
49137	49168	49128	49128	I	5148	“ I ’ve escorted a lot of women around this town , and I ’ve fucked a hell of a lot of them . But I did n’t date them . ”
49169	49172	49173	49173	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
49297	49311	49292	49292	I	5148	“ So that ’s it ? You just fuck them and dump them ? ”
49312	49319	49320	49320	he	5148	“ That ’s a bit harsh , ”
49323	49357	49320	49320	he	5148	“ Dump suggests they wanted something more , and I ’m quite certain that all they wanted was to be photographed on my arm and have a bit of fun in my bed . ”
49358	49363	49364	49364	I	5148	“ All of them ? ”
49377	49407	49320	49320	he	5148	“ I ’ve gone out with a few women who wanted more . I disentangled myself from those women . And no , I did n’t sleep with them . ”
49408	49411	49449	49449	His	5148	“ Oh . ”
49428	49437	49419	49419	I	5148	“ So you just do n’t do relationships ? ”
49438	49443	49320	49320	he	5148	“ Not with them . ”
49444	49448	49419	49419	I	5148	“ Why not ? ”
49465	49476	49477	49477	he	5148	“ Because none of them was the woman I wanted , ”
49560	49571	49572	49572	I	5148	“ But you did date someone not too long ago , ”
49611	49614	49615	49615	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
49618	49624	49615	49615	he	5148	“ I suppose I did . ”
49677	49689	49672	49672	I	5148	“ I heard that she died . I ’m so sorry . ”
49708	49713	49714	49714	His	5148	“ It was tragic . ”
49924	49969	49970	49970	I	5148	“ Listen , it was nice of you to come by to check on me . But I ’m fine . Really . And I ’m actually in a little bit of a hurry . I do n’t mean to be rude , but … ”
49980	49991	49970	49970	I	5148	“ Do you have a date tonight , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
49992	49995	49996	49996	I	5148	“ No ! ”
50034	50040	50019	50021	that special someone	1250	“ Where are you going ? ”
50041	50044	50045	50045	I	5148	“ What ? ”
50085	50101	50080	50080	he	5148	“ If you ’re not going on a date , then where are you going ? ”
50131	50153	50120	50120	I	5148	“ As a matter of fact , I ’m going to grab a smoothie and then go hike Fryman Canyon Park . ”
50154	50158	50080	50080	he	5148	“ By yourself ? ”
50159	50176	50120	50120	I	5148	“ Well , I could take the Royal Guard , but I think they ’re busy . ”
50177	50186	50080	50080	he	5148	“ It ’s going to be dark soon . ”
50187	50203	50120	50120	I	5148	“ It ’s not even six yet . Sunset ’s not until eight - thirtyish . ”
50204	50235	50080	50080	he	5148	“ The sun may not dip below the horizon until then , but there are foothills involved . And once the sun starts to sink , it gets dark fast . ”
50236	50273	50120	50120	I	5148	“ I ’m only going to take a few shots of the view and the sunset . Then I ’m coming back . I promise you I wo n’t let the boogey - men get me . ”
50274	50279	50280	50280	Damien	5148	“ They wo n’t , ”
50283	50297	50280	50280	Damien	5148	“ because I wo n’t let them . I ’m coming with you . ”
50298	50301	50302	50302	I	5148	“ No , ”
50305	50318	50302	50302	I	5148	“ I appreciate the concern , really I do . But no . ”
50319	50335	50361	50361	He	5148	“ Then do n’t go at all . Let me bring the sunset to you . ”
50357	50360	50345	50345	I	5148	“ What ? ”
50391	50398	50361	50361	He	5148	“ It reminded me of you . ”
50399	50402	50410	50410	me	5148	“ Really ? ”
50421	50447	50412	50412	He	5148	“ I had intended to give it to you earlier , but you were called away so quickly that I did n’t have the chance . ”
50471	50478	50479	50479	he	5148	“ Maybe I should be grateful , ”
50482	50493	50479	50479	he	5148	“ This way I get to see where you live . ”
50494	50516	50448	50448	I	5148	“ I have n’t really put my stamp on it yet . Jamie ’s taste runs to Early American Garage Sale . ”
50517	50521	50479	50479	he	5148	“ And yours ? ”
50522	50538	50448	50448	I	5148	“ I ’m much more refined . I go for Mid - Century Flea Market . ”
50539	50552	50479	50479	he	5148	“ A woman who knows her own mind . I like that . ”
50627	50631	50613	50613	I	5148	“ May I ? ”
50632	50636	50613	50613	I	5148	“ Of course . ”
50772	50777	50778	50778	I	5148	“ It ’s stunning , ”
50840	50849	50827	50828	Damien Stark	5148	“ Evelyn mentioned you were enjoying the sunset . ”
50865	50869	50870	50870	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
50926	50933	51049	51049	he	5148	“ Is this from your office ? ”
50934	50952	50913	50913	I	5148	“ It was . Now it has a new home with a woman who appreciates its beauty . ”
50953	50958	51049	51049	he	5148	“ Did n’t you ? ”
50959	50965	50913	50913	I	5148	“ Beauty should be shared . ”
50995	51006	50986	50986	I	5148	“ A Monet ? This is a copy , right ? ”
51007	51013	51014	51014	he	5148	“ It ’s an original , ”
51017	51035	51014	51014	he	5148	“ If it ’s not , I ’ll be having some very stern words with Sotheby ’s . ”
51036	51041	50986	50986	I	5148	“ But … but … ”
51042	51048	51049	51049	he	5148	“ It ’s a sunset , ”
51062	51070	51049	51049	he	5148	“ And it reminds me of you . ”
51071	51074	50986	50986	I	5148	“ Damien … ”
51075	51099	51100	51100	His	5148	“ And , of course , this gift is n’t nearly as precious as the one you left for me in the limo . ”
51120	51123	51124	51124	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
51191	51206	51207	51207	His	5148	“ They made the ride from the restaurant to my house much more enjoyable . ”
51231	51234	51235	51235	I	5148	“ Please , ”
51238	51244	51235	51235	I	5148	“ Please do n’t start . ”
51348	51353	51339	51339	I	5148	“ Damien , no . ”
51354	51374	51375	51375	His	5148	“ I assure you , Ms. Fairchild , your messages here and at my apartment have been well received . ”
51392	51401	51402	51402	I	5148	“ Oh . Good . That ’s good . ”
51408	51416	51402	51402	I	5148	“ It ’s just that you look — ”
51417	51420	51339	51339	I	5148	“ How ? ”
51421	51430	51402	51402	I	5148	“ A bit like the big bad wolf . ”
51431	51472	51339	51339	I	5148	“ And would that make you Little Red Riding Hood ? I may want to devour you , Ms. Fairchild , but I promise you that I ’m capable of controlling my urges . Most of the time , anyway . ”
51473	51486	51402	51402	I	5148	“ Of course . I ’m sorry . You just make me … ”
51487	51490	51339	51339	I	5148	“ What ? ”
51491	51494	51495	51495	I	5148	“ Skittish , ”
51498	51504	51505	51505	He	5148	“ Do I ? Interesting . ”
51518	51531	51339	51339	I	5148	“ Listen , thank you for the painting . It ’s amazing . ”
51532	51543	51339	51339	I	5148	“ But you ca n’t accept such an extravagant gift ? ”
51544	51552	51339	51339	I	5148	“ Hell no . I love it . ”
51564	51588	51339	51339	I	5148	“ I ’m perfectly happy to keep it if you really want me to have it . Despite , well , you know … ”
51597	51620	51594	51594	he	5148	“ Good . I was afraid that since you ’re in the habit of denying yourself things that you so obviously want … ”
51633	51653	51654	51654	I	5148	“ Actually , I was going to say that good manners would require me to offer you a drink . ”
51658	51674	51654	51654	I	5148	“ But I ’m not going to , since I ’m hoping you ’ll leave . ”
51675	51682	51697	51697	he	5148	“ Because I make you skittish ? ”
51683	51687	51688	51688	I	5148	“ Pretty much , ”
51691	51695	51697	51697	he	5148	“ I see . ”
51713	51716	51717	51717	I	5148	“ Well ? ”
51720	51725	51697	51697	he	5148	“ Well , what ? ”
51729	51738	51726	51726	I	5148	“ Well , are you going to go ? ”
51745	51766	51739	51739	His	5148	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t realize you wanted me to . I thought you were speaking hypothetically . ”
51791	51821	51780	51780	I	5148	“ I ’m going to have a drink . Of course my bourbon ’s probably not up to your exacting standards . But if you ’d like one anyway … ”
51822	51828	51829	51829	He	5148	“ So I can stay ? ”
51843	51873	51780	51780	I	5148	“ I guess you ’ll have to . We only have two highball glasses , and if you take the drink with you , Jamie will get pissed off . ”
51874	51894	51780	51780	I	5148	“ Would n’t want to disturb the subtle inner - workings of roommate relations . I accept your invitation . ”
51895	51903	51780	51780	I	5148	“ Straight up ? Or over ice ? ”
51904	51913	51780	51780	I	5148	“ However you ’re having it is fine . ”
51932	51940	51941	51941	I	5148	“ It ’s a trade - off , ”
51961	51984	51941	51941	I	5148	“ I like it slightly chilled , but if you savor it too long the ice melts and it gets watered down . ”
51985	51994	51995	51995	he	5148	“ Then we ’ll have to drink fast , ”
52007	52029	51941	51941	I	5148	“ Sorry , dude . I ’ve already done the wasted thing with you . I ’m going to sip mine . ”
52030	52042	52043	52043	His	5148	“ A shame . You ’re entertaining when you ’re drunk . ”
52050	52060	51941	51941	I	5148	“ No way . Do n’t even go there . ”
52096	52108	52109	52109	he	5148	“ I do have one more reason for coming here tonight , ”
52112	52144	52109	52109	he	5148	“ I wanted to check on you , and I wanted to give you the painting . But there ’s something else , too . I have a proposition for you . ”
52252	52257	52258	52258	I	5148	“ I ’m listening , ”
52295	52298	52299	52299	he	5148	“ Another ? ”
52303	52309	52310	52310	He	5148	“ Why the hell not ? ”
52385	52419	52369	52369	I	5148	“ I ’ve scoured Los Angeles and Orange County . I ’ve looked at the online collections of galleries all over the country . I have n’t found what I ’m looking for . ”
52420	52443	52483	52483	He	5148	“ For your new house . We ’re talking about the artwork you want to hang in the house you ’re building ? ”
52460	52482	52369	52369	I	5148	“ I ’ve finally figured out what I want , and yet it does n’t exist . Not yet , anyway . ”
52501	52509	52483	52483	He	5148	“ I ’m not really following you . ”
52510	52522	52483	52483	He	5148	“ As I said , I have a proposition . You . ”
52523	52535	52483	52483	He	5148	“ Ah . Um . I ’m still not following you . ”
52536	52550	52483	52483	He	5148	“ I want a portrait . Of you . I want a nude . ”
52563	52650	52483	52483	He	5148	“ The view is from behind . You ’re at the foot of a bed , facing a window that looks out over the ocean . Sheer curtains billow around you , caressing your skin . You stand at an angle , so we can see the swell of your breast , the barest hint of a nipple . But your face is turned away . Your identity is a secret . It ’s known only to me . And , of course , to you . ”
52808	52811	52812	52812	he	5148	“ Good , ”
52815	52842	52812	52812	he	5148	“ You ’re not discounting the idea outright . I want this , Nikki . I can already picture how it will look on my wall . ”
52858	52874	52843	52843	I	5148	“ You think you know what you ’d be getting , but you do n’t . ”
52899	52904	52886	52886	He	5148	“ Do n’t I ? ”
52950	52953	52954	52954	I	5148	“ No , ”
52957	52961	52962	52962	I	5148	“ Not happening . ”
52968	52993	52962	52962	I	5148	“ Maybe we should just find you a nice poster . Like the Hang in there , Baby kitten . That would be charming . ”
53005	53019	52994	52994	My	5148	“ Name your price , Ms. Fairchild . Tell me what you want . ”
53020	53025	52994	52994	My	5148	“ What I want ? ”
53061	53067	53068	53068	I	5148	“ I want a family , ”
53071	53078	53068	53068	I	5148	“ I want a satisfying career . ”
53097	53103	53090	53090	I	5148	“ I want world peace . ”
53236	53247	53248	53248	he	5148	“ I can give you what you want , Nikki , ”
53304	53317	53293	53293	I	5148	“ Will you be orchestrating world peace today or later this month ? ”
53318	53327	53328	53328	he	5148	“ I ’ll pay you for the portrait , ”
53338	53376	53328	53328	he	5148	“ I ’ll pay you . I ’ll pay the artist . I ’ll arrange a studio space . You ’re a businesswoman , Nikki . Is n’t that what you ultimately want ? Your own business ? ”
53402	53414	53328	53328	he	5148	“ This is a chance to kick - start your career . ”
53433	53443	53415	53415	I	5148	“ I ’m a businesswoman , not a model . ”
53444	53456	53415	53415	I	5148	“ You ’re my model . And everyone has a price . ”
53457	53462	53415	53415	I	5148	“ I do n’t . ”
53463	53466	53467	53467	He	5148	“ No ? ”
53479	53497	53467	53467	He	5148	“ One million dollars , Ms. Fairchild . You get the cash , and I get you . ”
53681	53688	53675	53675	I	5148	“ I think you should leave . ”
53702	53707	53708	53708	he	5148	“ I ’ll go , ”
53711	53719	53708	53708	he	5148	“ But I will get my painting . ”
53737	53766	53767	53767	he	5148	“ I ’ll get it because I want it — because I want you . And I ’ll get it because you want it , too . No , ”
53774	53792	53767	53767	he	5148	“ Remember the rules . Do n’t lie to me , Nikki . Never lie to me . ”
54078	54081	54082	54082	I	5148	“ Douglas ? ”
54103	54107	54108	54108	she	1271	“ God no , ”
54145	54150	54151	54151	she	1271	“ Kevin in 2H , ”
54162	54167	54136	54136	she	1271	“ You fucked him ? ”
54168	54208	54136	54136	she	1271	“ Trust me , that ’s all he ’s good for . The guy ’s really not a brain trust , and we do n’t have a lot in common . Well , except for an excess of energy . ”
54209	54214	54215	54215	My	5148	“ Jesus , Jamie . ”
54231	54244	54151	54151	she	1271	“ Why sleep with him if you do n’t even like him ? ”
54245	54279	54136	54136	she	1271	“ Because it ’s fun . Do n’t worry . He ’s not going to go all stalker on me . We both know it ’s a no - strings kind of thing . ”
54280	54287	54288	54288	I	5148	“ It ’s dangerous , James , ”
54304	54309	54310	54310	she	1273	“ Bullshit , Nicholas , ”
54313	54325	54310	54310	she	1273	“ I told you . He ’s not the dangerous sort . ”
54326	54368	54136	54136	she	1271	“ I ’m not talking about only him . But just because you think he looks nice does n’t mean he ’s not a whack job . And how do you know you wo n’t catch something ? Were you careful ? ”
54369	54385	54310	54310	she	1273	“ Christ , already . Are you my mom ? Of course I was careful . ”
54386	54393	54394	54394	I	5148	“ Sorry . I ’m sorry . ”
54409	54436	54394	54394	I	5148	“ You ’re my best friend . I worry . I mean , you do these guys , and then they ’re out of your life . ”
54444	54452	54453	54453	I	5148	“ Do you ever think about dating ? ”
54462	54466	54524	54524	she	1275	“ Do you ? ”
54473	54480	54467	54467	I	5148	“ This is n’t about me . ”
54481	54510	54524	54524	she	1275	“ No , but it could be . I fuck around . You do n’t fuck at all . It ’s like we ’re that Emily Dickinson poem . ”
54519	54523	54524	54524	she	1275	“ The candle , ”
54527	54541	54524	54524	she	1275	“ You burn at one end , and I burn at the other . ”
54549	54556	54542	54542	I	5148	“ That makes no sense whatsoever . ”
54642	54650	54651	54651	Jamie	1450	“ That smile is n’t for me , ”
54654	54693	54651	54651	Jamie	1450	“ And I seriously doubt it ’s for Kevin or Douglas . So let ’s see … hmmm … could you be thinking about the sexy hunka hunka billionaire who just left our little shack of a condo ? ”
54694	54699	54700	54700	I	5148	“ I could be , ”
54703	54726	54700	54700	I	5148	“ So what was the present ? More important , why are n’t you two in your bedroom fucking your brains out ? ”
54727	54733	54734	54734	I	5148	“ We ’re not dating , ”
54737	54746	54734	54734	I	5148	“ Like you have to date to fuck ? ”
54747	54758	54759	54759	I	5148	“ He wants me to pose for a nude portrait , ”
54773	54788	54759	54759	I	5148	“ And he ’s willing to pay me one million dollars to get it . ”
54806	54813	54789	54789	She	1276	“ A million dollars ? Seriously ? ”
54814	54817	54789	54789	She	1276	“ Yup . ”
54818	54827	54789	54789	She	1276	“ So ? Are you thinking about it ? ”
54828	54831	54832	54832	I	5148	“ No , ”
54836	54841	54832	54832	I	5148	“ Of course not . ”
54891	54896	54897	54897	I	5148	“ Let ’s go , ”
54905	54910	54900	54900	Jamie	1450	“ Go ? Where ? ”
54911	54930	54900	54900	Jamie	1450	“ Out . It ’s Saturday . There will be dancing involved . And drinking . Definitely drinking . ”
54931	54936	54900	54900	Jamie	1450	“ Are we celebrating ? ”
54946	54949	54950	54950	I	5148	“ Maybe . ”
54953	54962	54950	54950	I	5148	“ But maybe I just want to dance . ”
54963	54971	54972	54972	she	1276	“ We should call Ollie and Courtney , ”
55006	55021	54987	54987	I	5148	“ He called earlier , by the way . I forgot to tell you . ”
55022	55036	54950	54950	I	5148	“ Oh , hell . Did he want me to call him back ? ”
55040	55067	55037	55037	She	1276	“ He was just calling to check on you . Make sure Damien Stark did n’t eat you up last night . Little did he know . ”
55072	55079	55037	55037	She	1276	“ You did n’t tell him ? ”
55080	55115	55122	55122	her	1276	“ All I said was that you got home safe . That Stark put you in a limo and sent you home . I did n’t share the dirty details . Should I have ? ”
55125	55134	55122	55122	her	1276	“ I bet Ollie would like that story . ”
55135	55138	55139	55139	I	5148	“ No , ”
55143	55146	55139	55139	I	5148	“ No . ”
55147	55154	55122	55122	her	1276	“ So do we call them ? ”
55155	55159	55139	55139	I	5148	“ Why not ? ”
55212	55217	55218	55218	Ollie	837	“ Do n’t worry , ”
55232	55241	55218	55218	Ollie	837	“ I promise we ’ll glide right in . ”
55295	55298	55299	55300	the guy	243	“ In , ”
55321	55326	55327	55327	I	5148	“ This is crazy , ”
55330	55337	55327	55327	I	5148	“ We ca n’t even talk . ”
55338	55342	55343	55343	Jamie	1450	“ Then dance ! ”
55577	55583	55584	55584	I	5148	“ Drinks are on me , ”
55686	55692	55693	55693	I	5148	“ She wear you out ? ”
55696	55699	55700	55700	he	5148	“ Never , ”
55714	55739	55700	55700	he	5148	“ She hit the ladies ’ . Thought I ’d come find you . There ’s something I want to talk to you about . ”
55740	55743	55744	55744	I	5148	“ Okay . ”
55762	55767	55744	55744	I	5148	“ What ’s up ? ”
55768	55771	55772	55772	he	5148	“ Stark , ”
55775	55792	55772	55772	he	5148	“ I got the impression from Jamie that things between you two might be heating up . ”
55802	55807	55808	55808	I	5148	“ They ’re not , ”
55857	55860	55861	55861	he	5148	“ Yeah ? ”
55864	55876	55861	55861	he	5148	“ Well , good . Because I was worried about you . ”
55884	55889	55861	55861	he	5148	“ Really ? Why ? ”
55898	55915	55890	55890	He	5148	“ The way he looked at you at the party . The way you looked back . ”
55916	55925	55926	55926	I	5148	“ Okay , yeah , there was heat , ”
55929	55946	55926	55926	I	5148	“ But why is that a problem ? Why did you tell me to be careful ? ”
55972	55986	55890	55890	He	5148	“ Just stay away from him , okay ? The guy ’s dangerous . ”
55987	55991	55926	55926	I	5148	“ Dangerous how ? ”
55995	56008	55992	55992	Ollie	837	“ You know . He has a temper , for one thing . ”
56009	56015	56016	56016	I	5148	“ That ’s hardly news , ”
56019	56039	56016	56016	I	5148	“ He was famous for it during his tennis days . That ’s how he messed up his eye . ”
56093	56120	56122	56122	Ollie	837	“ But that was a long time ago , and he ’s not a competitive athlete anymore . Is that seriously what you ’re concerned about ? ”
56139	56146	56147	56147	she	1297	“ I ’m taking him back , ”
56185	56190	56191	56191	I	5148	“ Seriously , Jamie , ”
56208	56216	56195	56195	she	1297	“ Ca n’t we just go home ? ”
56305	56339	56287	56287	Jamie	1450	“ One of the articles I read said it had beach access . And I used to hang with this guy from Malibu , so I got to know the roads pretty well . ”
56407	56415	56416	56416	I	5148	“ We might as well go home , ”
56419	56428	56416	56416	I	5148	“ We ’re never going to find it . ”
56429	56433	56434	56434	she	1303	“ We will , ”
56454	56512	56434	56434	she	1303	“ If it has beach access there are n’t that many streets it can be on . And it ’s not like there ’s a lot of construction going on right now , especially not for the square footage that a guy like Damien Stark will want . When we get close , we ’ll see it . ”
56513	56574	56446	56446	she	1303	“ Yeah , but that ’s part of the problem , is n’t it ? I mean , this is n’t some two - thousand - square - foot house in suburban Texas where you can just wander through the framing and drywall . Even if you find it , there ’s going to be a fence and probably security . ”
56575	56582	56583	56583	she	1303	“ I just want to see , ”
56593	56617	56583	56583	she	1303	“ Do n’t you ? I mean , you can learn a lot about a guy from his taste in buildings , right ? ”
56698	56705	56678	56678	I	5148	“ Ollie says Stark is dangerous . ”
56706	56709	56710	56710	she	1303	“ Yeah , ”
56716	56727	56710	56710	she	1303	“ He told me . He ’s worried about you . ”
56728	56733	56734	56734	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
56766	56770	56760	56760	Ollie	837	“ Dangerous how ? ”
56780	56796	56771	56771	I	5148	“ I ’m not buying his line that it ’s all about Stark ’s temper . ”
56797	56856	56760	56760	Ollie	837	“ Temper ? I do n’t think so . He would n’t say exactly . I figure he knows something from work . Bender , Twain & McGuire reps Stark , you know . Their corporate department handles all his business stuff , and I guess the rest of the firm handles , you know , everything else . ”
56857	56860	56861	56861	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
56865	56871	56861	56861	I	5148	“ Attorney - client privilege ? ”
56872	56876	56877	56877	Jamie	1450	“ I guess , ”
56880	56916	56877	56877	Jamie	1450	“ I mean , I do n’t think Ollie has worked on any of Stark ’s stuff directly , he ’s too junior . But he ’s probably seen files and heard the partners talking . ”
56917	56931	56861	56861	I	5148	“ But he did n’t give you any idea what it ’s about ? ”
56932	56945	56877	56877	Jamie	1450	“ Well , no . But it ’s pretty obvious , right ? ”
56950	56953	56948	56948	me	5148	“ Obvious ? ”
56954	56963	56964	56964	She	1450	“ That girl . The one who died . ”
56982	56994	56964	56964	She	1450	“ The one you said he dated ? What about her ? ”
56995	57005	57006	57006	She	1450	“ I read a little bit more about it . ”
57014	57052	57053	57053	She	1450	“ I was bored and I was curious . Anyway , she was asphyxiated . The coroner officially ruled it an accident , but I guess her brother ’s been hinting around that Stark was involved . … ”
57064	57073	57060	57060	I	5148	“ He ’s saying that Damien killed her ? ”
57102	57113	57114	57114	Jamie	1450	“ I do n’t think he ’s gone that far , ”
57117	57182	57183	57183	She	1450	“ I mean , if Damien Stark ’s a murder suspect , that would be all over the news , right ? And it really is n’t . I just found a few comments on some crap - ass gossip sites . Honestly , I did n’t think anything of it . A powerful guy like Stark must field all sorts of nutcase rumors . ”
57202	57205	57183	57183	She	1450	“ What ? ”
57206	57209	57183	57183	She	1450	“ Nothing . ”
57210	57217	57183	57183	She	1450	“ Dammit , Jamie , what ? ”
57218	57293	57183	57183	She	1450	“ I was just thinking about Ollie . If it is just Internet bullshit , then why would he know any of this ? But if there ’s really something to it , then Stark ’s lawyers must be all over the brother , you know ? Threatening libel or slander or whatever the hell you call it . And a guy like Stark is probably pretty good at controlling the press , right ? ”
57310	57321	57297	57297	Evelyn	5962	“ I guess . Is that what Ollie told you ? ”
57322	57334	57335	57335	She	1450	“ No , no . He did n’t say anything specific . ”
57338	57368	57335	57335	She	1450	“ He ’s just worried about you . But honestly , Nik , it ’s probably nothing . Just the crap uber - rich guys have to deal with . ”
57369	57376	57386	57386	Padgett	337	“ So who ’s the girl ? ”
57377	57385	57335	57335	She	1450	“ Some socialite type . Sara Padgett . ”
57422	57427	57408	57408	Jamie	1450	“ What the hell ? ”
57428	57443	57444	57444	She	1450	“ Sorry . I think I saw something on that street we just passed . ”
57529	57539	57562	57562	She	1450	“ Wow . Do you think that ’s his ? ”
57540	57558	57559	57559	Jamie	1450	“ I do n’t know . It ’s not as big as I thought it would be , ”
57608	57613	57614	57614	Jamie	1450	“ It ’s his , ”
57617	57644	57614	57614	Jamie	1450	“ I remember that name from one of the articles . But shit , Stark is rolling in money . Should n’t this be a mansion ? ”
57645	57648	57649	57649	I	5148	“ No , ”
57652	57657	57649	57649	I	5148	“ It ’s perfect . ”
57888	57893	57894	57894	Jamie	1450	“ A million dollars , ”
57901	57909	57894	57894	Jamie	1450	“ It ’s like winning the lottery . ”
58006	58019	58020	58020	Her	1320	“ He would n’t be getting what he thinks he ’s getting . ”
58025	58034	58020	58020	Her	1320	“ Caveat emptor , baby . Buyer beware . ”
58137	58139	58146	58146	Damien	5148	“ regain ”
58159	58163	58164	58164	I	5148	“ Caveat emptor , ”
58213	58219	58220	58220	Jamie	1450	“ Carl would like it , ”
58236	58248	58249	58249	I	5148	“ I ’d rather not test that theory . You coming ? ”
58282	58293	58266	58266	She	1325	“ I think most of this stuff is actually clean . ”
58297	58306	58294	58294	I	5148	“ How is it that we ’re friends ? ”
58307	58312	58294	58294	I	5148	“ Yin and yang . ”
58313	58322	58294	58294	I	5148	“ Do you have any auditions next week ? ”
58323	58328	58294	58294	I	5148	“ Two , actually . ”
58329	58358	58361	58361	she	1325	“ Then rewash all that stuff , and I ’ll help you fold and iron . Because you are not going to an audition covered in cat fur . ”
58394	58400	58379	58379	She	1325	“ Is that my dress ? ”
58407	58436	58401	58401	Jamie	1450	“ One of the auditions is for Sexy Girl in Bar and there ’s three lines of dialogue . I was going to have it dry - cleaned . ”
58437	58440	58441	58441	I	5148	“ Yang , ”
58445	58459	58441	58441	I	5148	“ Come on . Let ’s go see if the machines are free . ”
58520	58525	58526	58526	She	1325	“ We have champagne ? ”
58529	58537	58538	58538	She	1325	“ Got some at the store yesterday . ”
58549	58554	58538	58538	She	1325	“ And orange juice . ”
58603	58606	58607	58607	I	5148	“ Awesome , ”
58610	58617	58607	58607	I	5148	“ Did you think about cups ? ”
58618	58624	58625	58625	she	1325	“ I thought of everything , ”
58655	58660	58661	58661	I	5148	“ I love Sunday , ”
58679	58683	58661	58661	I	5148	“ No shit . ”
59171	59177	59184	59184	she	1336	“ What time is it ? ”
59209	59221	59222	59222	she	1336	“ I told Ollie he should come hang with us today , ”
59231	59259	59222	59222	she	1336	“ I mean , it must suck with Courtney out of town , and I thought he had a good time last night , did n’t you ? ”
59260	59266	59267	59267	I	5148	“ He looked to be , ”
59270	59290	59267	59267	I	5148	“ But you ’re the girl who can force anyone to have a good time on a dance floor . ”
59291	59314	59315	59315	She	1336	“ Ha ! I was so not forcing him . That boy may not admit it , but he likes to dance . ”
59339	59347	59328	59328	she	1336	“ Do you think he ’ll come ? ”
59379	59384	59348	59348	I	5148	“ Call and ask . ”
59385	59400	59401	59401	She	1336	“ Nah . It ’s no big deal . If he comes he comes . ”
59425	59437	59438	59438	I	5148	“ He wants me to wear a tux at the wedding , ”
59446	59460	59438	59438	I	5148	“ Because I ’ll be his best man . When he gets married . ”
59461	59476	59401	59401	She	1336	“ Oh please , Nikki . I am not banging Ollie . Quit worrying . ”
59477	59480	59481	59481	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
59490	59500	59481	59481	I	5148	“ Sometimes I think you need these little reminders . ”
59501	59548	59401	59401	She	1336	“ But were you serious about the tux ? Because that ’s just so eighties . Or maybe the seventies ? When did Annie Hall come out ? That ’s the movie where Diane What’s - Her - Face wore the men ’s clothes , right ? ”
59549	59553	59554	59554	I	5148	“ Diane Keaton , ”
59557	59600	59554	59554	I	5148	“ Annie Hall , and it ’s classic Woody Allen from 1977 . Honestly , James , it won Best Picture . How can you not know this ? You ’re the one who wants to work in Hollywood , not me . ”
59601	59616	59617	59617	I	5148	“ I want to work in Hollywood now . Not before I was born . ”
59682	59685	59686	59686	I	5148	“ Mother , ”
59699	59704	59686	59686	I	5148	“ How did you — ”
59725	59742	59720	59720	I	5148	“ How did you get so lucky to call when I actually have time to talk ? ”
59743	59748	59749	59749	she	1341	“ Hello , Nichole , ”
59756	59786	59749	59749	she	1341	“ It ’s Sunday morning . You should be at church trying to meet a nice man , but I had a feeling I ’d catch you at home . ”
59875	59886	59870	59870	she	1341	“ I ’m sure you know why I ’m calling . ”
59905	59910	59913	59913	her	1341	“ Um , no ? ”
60018	60026	60009	60009	she	5230	“ Today is Ashley ’s wedding anniversary . ”
60084	60094	60071	60071	she	1349	“ Listen , Mother . I have to go . ”
60095	60101	60122	60122	Damien	5148	“ Are you dating anyone ? ”
60111	60114	60115	60115	I	5148	“ No , ”
60127	60134	60071	60071	she	1349	“ Does that no mean yes ? ”
60135	60140	60071	60071	she	1349	“ Mother , please . ”
60141	60194	60071	60071	she	1349	“ Nichole , you ’re twenty - four years old . You ’re beautiful — assuming you have n’t gotten even bigger in the hips — but you ’re not getting any younger . And with your — well , we all have flaws , but yours are so extreme , and — ”
60195	60200	60071	60071	she	1349	“ Jesus , Mother . ”
60201	60223	60071	60071	she	1349	“ I ’m simply saying that at twenty - four you need to be thinking about getting on with your life . ”
60224	60232	60233	60233	I	5148	“ That ’s what I ’m doing . ”
60257	60274	60275	60275	I	5148	“ Mother , seriously , I have to go . There ’s someone at the door . ”
60299	60316	60284	60284	Jamie	1450	“ Nikki ! Some guy ’s at the door ! Holy fuck , he ’s gorgeous ! ”
60334	60345	60346	60347	my mother	5168	“ Well , I ’ll let you go , then , ”
60381	60390	60374	60374	I	5148	“ Goodbye , Nichole . Kiss - kiss . ”
60434	60441	60442	60442	I	5148	“ Oh . My . God , ”
60445	60450	60442	60442	I	5148	“ Are you nuts ? ”
60451	60456	60457	60457	she	5168	“ That was priceless , ”
60460	60474	60457	60457	she	5168	“ Honestly , I wish I could have seen your mother ’s face . ”
60486	60490	60491	60491	Jamie	1450	“ Come on , ”
60501	60537	60491	60491	Jamie	1450	“ Let ’s go move our stuff to the dryer . And I ’m still hungry . Wanna do pizza and a movie ? How about Annie Hall ? I hear it won an Oscar . ”
60758	60761	60762	60762	Stark	5148	“ Nikki , ”
60780	60787	60793	60793	me	5148	“ What happened to Sara Padgett ? ”
60821	60835	60885	60885	I	5148	“ She died , Nikki . But I believe you already knew that . ”
60836	60843	60844	60844	I	5148	“ I want to know how , ”
60847	60880	60844	60844	I	5148	“ And I want to know about the two of you . Your security got all riled up yesterday when someone named Padgett showed up . And if I ’m going to — ”
60881	60884	60885	60885	I	5148	“ What ? ”
60891	60916	60885	60885	I	5148	“ If I ’m going to consider your very generous offer , I need to understand the kind of man I ’m dealing with . ”
60917	60920	60885	60885	I	5148	“ Jesus . ”
60937	60940	60844	60844	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
60941	60957	60885	60885	I	5148	“ I ’m here . This is bullshit , Nikki . You know that right ? ”
60958	60961	60962	60962	I	5148	“ No , ”
60965	60979	60962	60962	I	5148	“ I do n’t know shit because you ’re not telling me anything . ”
60990	61074	60984	60984	they	1359	“ Sara Padgett and her brother , Eric , inherited a controlling share of an interesting little company called Padgett Enviro - Works from their father . The company had made their father quite wealthy , but it lost its edge after he passed away , and started spiraling downward . Eric was failing at management and Sara was n’t interested in the company at all . I saw an opportunity for growth and made an overture to buy their shares of stock . ”
61117	61153	61102	61102	he	1360	“ They both declined my offer , but Sara asked if I would escort her to a charity function . I agreed . One thing led to another and we continued to see each other . ”
61154	61160	61102	61102	he	1360	“ Did you love her ? ”
61161	61176	61102	61102	he	1360	“ No . She was a friend . Her death was a horrible shock . ”
61177	61183	61102	61102	he	1360	“ It was an accident ? ”
61184	61215	61102	61102	he	1360	“ I can only imagine so . Apparently it looked like autoerotic asphyxiation that went very , very bad . The coroner ruled it an accident and that was that . ”
61261	61278	61256	61256	I	5148	“ But there ’s more , is n’t there ? That ’s not the whole story . ”
61279	61286	61238	61238	he	1360	“ Why do you say so ? ”
61287	61302	61256	61256	I	5148	“ I — someone — I mean , a friend is worried about me . ”
61312	61324	61256	61256	I	5148	“ About me and you . He thinks you ’re dangerous . ”
61325	61329	61336	61336	Stark	5148	“ Does he ? ”
61375	61382	61383	61383	I	5148	“ That ’s not the point , ”
61386	61391	61383	61383	I	5148	“ What else happened ? ”
61392	61396	61397	61397	he	1360	“ Her brother , ”
61401	61437	61397	61397	he	1360	“ Somehow , Eric is convinced that I tied her up , choked her , and left her for dead , accidentally killing her . And he ’s just itching to go sell his story . ”
61438	61441	61442	61442	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
61447	61452	61442	61442	I	5148	“ That ’s horrible . ”
61464	61481	61397	61397	he	1360	“ So that ’s that . What do you think , Nikki ? Am I dangerous ? ”
61504	61525	61397	61397	he	1360	“ I ’m really sorry . I should n’t have brought it up . It ’s none of my business . ”
61526	61533	61455	61455	he	1360	“ No , it ’s not . ”
61546	61591	61455	61455	he	1360	“ Dammit , Nikki . I ’m the one who ’s sorry . Of course you ’ll hear rumors . Of course you have a right to ask questions . Considering what I ’m asking , you can ask all the questions you want . ”
61592	61599	61397	61397	he	1360	“ You ’re really not mad ? ”
61600	61621	61455	61455	he	1360	“ At you , no . At Padgett — well , let ’s just say he ’s on my list . ”
61633	61643	61644	61644	he	1360	“ I hope you ’re still considering my offer , ”
61647	61675	61644	61644	he	1360	“ I very much want for you to say yes . I ’m hoping it wo n’t take too much longer for you to reach a decision . ”
61676	61682	61683	61683	I	5148	“ I ’ve already decided , ”
61701	61705	61706	61706	he	1360	“ Tell me , ”
61725	61730	61710	61710	I	5148	“ I have conditions . ”
61731	61747	61706	61706	he	1360	“ So we ’re negotiating . Excellent . What are your terms , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
61765	61812	61710	61710	I	5148	“ First of all , you need to understand that I ’m doing this for the money . I need it , I can use it , I want it . So please keep that in mind . Your million dollars color all of my terms . ”
61813	61817	61710	61710	I	5148	“ I understand . ”
61818	61836	61710	61710	I	5148	“ I get paid no matter what , even if you end up not liking the painting . ”
61837	61858	61710	61710	I	5148	“ Certainly . The money is your fee . It has nothing to do with my satisfaction with the painting . ”
61859	61880	61710	61710	I	5148	“ You ca n’t sell it . Not to anyone . It ’s either yours , or it ’s destroyed . ”
61881	61889	61710	61710	I	5148	“ So far your terms are satisfactory . ”
61905	61927	61890	61890	I	5148	“ The artist has to paint me . Me . Not some artistic representation of me , but the real me . ”
61928	61937	61938	61938	he	5148	“ You are what I want , Nikki , ”
61987	62018	61978	61978	I	5148	“ Just making sure we understand each other , Mr. Stark . Once I take my clothes off , that ’s it . What you see is what you get . ”
62019	62032	61967	61967	God	229	“ Be careful , Ms. Fairchild . You ’re making me hard . ”
62033	62042	61978	61978	I	5148	“ Dammit , Stark , I ’m serious . ”
62043	62055	61967	61967	God	229	“ Oh , I ’m serious , too . Believe me . ”
62070	62075	62056	62056	I	5148	“ So we agree ? ”
62083	62105	61978	61978	I	5148	“ To your terms ? Absolutely . Of course , I have a few deal points of my own to address . ”
62106	62110	62063	62063	him	5148	“ Deal points ? ”
62111	62133	61978	61978	I	5148	“ Certainly . You ’ve changed the original terms with a counteroffer . It ’s my privilege to do the same . ”
62134	62137	62138	62138	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
62157	62193	61978	61978	I	5148	“ And let me be just as clear as you were , Ms. Fairchild . This is no longer a negotiation . These are my final terms . You agree , or you do n’t . ”
62194	62199	62200	62200	I	5148	“ Um , okay . ”
62221	62228	62209	62209	I	5148	“ So what are the terms ? ”
62229	62242	61978	61978	I	5148	“ From now until the painting is completed , you ’re mine . ”
62243	62246	62209	62209	I	5148	“ Yours ? ”
62256	62263	61978	61978	I	5148	“ What exactly does that mean ? ”
62264	62272	61978	61978	I	5148	“ What do you think it means ? ”
62287	62294	62283	62283	I	5148	“ That I belong to you . ”
62354	62358	62359	62359	he	5148	“ What else ? ”
62362	62370	62371	62371	I	5148	“ That I do as you say . ”
62393	62396	62397	62397	Damien	5148	“ Yes , ”
62424	62431	62400	62400	His	5148	“ And if I do n’t ? ”
62432	62454	62400	62400	His	5148	“ You studied science , Ms. Fairchild . Surely you ’re aware that every action has an equal and opposite reaction . ”
62455	62458	62459	62459	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
62485	62493	62494	62494	he	5148	“ You like that , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
62519	62527	62514	62514	I	5148	“ What if I do n’t agree ? ”
62528	62545	62506	62506	he	5148	“ Then I do n’t get my painting , and you do n’t get your million . ”
62546	62560	62514	62514	I	5148	“ Why make me agree ? I ’ve already said I ’ll pose . ”
62561	62596	62506	62506	he	5148	“ Because I can . Because I want you . Because I do n’t want to court my way up to our first fuck . And because I do n’t want to play games . ”
62597	62608	62514	62514	I	5148	“ Is n’t a game exactly what you ’re playing ? ”
62609	62625	62506	62506	he	5148	“ A fair point , Ms. Fairchild . But I want this on my terms . ”
62626	62650	62514	62514	I	5148	“ You say you want me , but you do n’t . You say you want my portrait , but you wo n’t . ”
62669	62674	62675	62675	he	5148	“ You ’re wrong , ”
62679	62713	62506	62506	he	5148	“ I do n’t think so . And that ’s why my terms are important . You call it off — the painting , this game — and I still get my money . ”
62714	62720	62514	62514	I	5148	“ Is that an agreement ? ”
62721	62727	62506	62506	he	5148	“ It ’s a condition . ”
62728	62737	62514	62514	I	5148	“ Very well . I accept your condition . ”
62738	62756	62506	62506	he	5148	“ And we do n’t start now . We start at the first session with the artist . ”
62757	62775	62514	62514	I	5148	“ You ’re a tough negotiator , Ms. Fairchild . But I accept your proposed commencement date . ”
62797	62806	62807	62807	I	5148	“ And it ’s not open - ended , ”
62810	62841	62807	62807	I	5148	“ For all I know , you ’re paying the artist by the hour , and he ’ll take a year to complete it . One week , Mr. Stark . ”
62842	62846	62847	62847	He	5148	“ One week ? ”
62853	62884	62847	62847	He	5148	“ That ’s my best offer . And , of course , you ’ll have to work around my day job . But my evenings and the weekend are yours . ”
62885	62900	62948	62948	my	5148	“ Very well . One week . Now , do we have a deal ? ”
62912	62925	62909	62909	I	5148	“ What — what exactly do you want to do with me ? ”
62926	62946	62948	62948	my	5148	“ So many things , but mostly I want to fuck you . Hard and fast and very thoroughly . ”
62950	62958	62948	62948	my	5148	“ I — will it be kinky ? ”
62962	62970	62959	62959	He	5148	“ Would you like it to be ? ”
62976	62989	62971	62971	I	5148	“ I ’m not — I mean , I have n’t ever . ”
63122	63130	63131	63131	he	5148	“ I want to give you pleasure , ”
63134	63165	63131	63131	he	5148	“ That ’s all I want to do . Will we do things that are kinky ? You may think so . But I also think you ’ll like it . ”
63253	63260	63261	63261	he	5148	“ Take a chance , Nikki , ”
63265	63277	63261	63261	he	5148	“ Let me show you how far I can take you . ”
63298	63303	63304	63304	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
63325	63329	63330	63330	he	5148	“ Good girl , ”
63335	63344	63330	63330	he	5148	“ Dear God , I want you now . ”
63349	63357	63358	63358	I	5148	“ The first session , Mr. Stark , ”
63371	63424	63358	63358	I	5148	“ Of course , Ms. Fairchild . I ’ll send a car for you tomorrow evening . I ’ll text you when it ’s on the way . Stay in tonight and relax . I want you refreshed . And open your door . There ’s something for you on the mat . ”
63429	63436	63437	63437	he	5148	“ Sweet dreams , Ms. Fairchild , ”
64074	64079	64080	64080	I	5148	“ Is he in ? ”
64083	64095	64096	64096	Jennifer	351	“ I have an idea about tweaking one of the algorithms . ”
64136	64143	64144	64144	Jennifer	351	“ He did n’t call you ? ”
64147	64157	64144	64144	Jennifer	351	“ I thought for sure he would call you . ”
64163	64169	64188	64188	She	351	“ Why would he call ? ”
64170	64187	64188	64188	She	351	“ He — oh , shit . Here . He said to give this to you . ”
64215	64218	64219	64219	I	5148	“ Jennifer , ”
64224	64229	64219	64219	I	5148	“ What is this ? ”
64230	64242	64243	64243	She	351	“ It ’s your check . And that ’s your stuff . ”
64276	64280	64281	64281	I	5148	“ I see . ”
64286	64297	64281	64281	I	5148	“ You never answered my question . Is he in ? ”
64332	64391	64324	64324	She	351	“ No . I mean , yes , he ’s here . But he said he would n’t see you . I ’m sorry , Nikki , but he was really , really clear on that . He said that if you did n’t just take your stuff and go , that I ’m supposed to call security . ”
64405	64409	64400	64400	I	5148	“ But why ? ”
64410	64418	64419	64419	Jennifer	351	“ I do n’t know . Honest . ”
64461	64468	64422	64422	she	351	“ He did n’t say anything ? ”
64469	64486	64422	64422	she	351	“ Not to me . But I think it has something to do with the pitch . ”
64487	64491	64492	64492	My	5148	“ The pitch ? ”
64498	64504	64492	64492	My	5148	“ But it went great . ”
64505	64525	64422	64422	she	351	“ Really ? Because Stark called first thing this morning and told Carl he was n’t going to invest . ”
64530	64535	64526	64526	My	5148	“ You ’re serious ? ”
64536	64543	64492	64492	My	5148	“ You really did n’t know ? ”
64544	64550	64526	64526	My	5148	“ I really did n’t . ”
64660	64665	64666	64666	Joe	305	“ Thirty - five , ”
64669	64684	64685	64685	I	5148	“ Thanks . Do you happen to know if Mr. Stark is in today ? ”
64695	64703	64685	64685	I	5148	“ I believe so , Ms. Fairchild . ”
64704	64707	64708	64708	I	5148	“ Great , ”
64835	64860	64819	64825	A young woman with curly red hair	1246	“ Ms. Fairchild ? Welcome to Stark International . If you ’ll follow me , I ’ll take you to Mr. Stark ’s office . ”
64861	64868	64869	64869	I	5148	“ I — what ? Oh … ”
65060	65064	65065	65065	she	1399	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
65076	65083	65065	65065	she	1399	“ You can go on in . ”
65215	65223	65224	65225	my escort	1401	“ Go ahead and have a seat , ”
65228	65238	65240	65240	she	1401	“ He ’ll be with you in a moment . ”
65332	65342	65343	65343	Stark	5148	“ I ’m looking at the quarterlies right now , ”
65452	65460	65461	65461	Stark	5148	“ I ’m not interested in excuses , ”
65464	65569	65461	65461	Stark	5148	“ I ’m interested in hard , cold numbers . Yes , well , tell him that the time to ply me with projections was when he pitched the project in the first place . And the time for excuses is never . If he ca n’t live up to the schedule we agreed to , then I ’ll put in my own team . Hell yes , I have that right . No ? Well , have him read the contract again . Then we ’ll talk . Fine . No , I think this conversation is over . All right , then . ”
65632	65638	65639	65639	he	225	“ What a wonderful surprise , ”
65684	65688	65689	65689	I	5148	“ Goddamn you , ”
65742	65747	65748	65748	I	5148	“ Oh , God , ”
65751	65756	65757	65757	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry . ”
65773	65781	65757	65757	I	5148	“ I ’m so , so sorry . ”
65782	65788	65789	65789	he	225	“ What the fucking hell ? ”
65842	65857	65833	65833	Ollie	837	“ Carl fired me . Do n’t even pretend like you did n’t know . ”
65858	65863	65864	65864	he	225	“ I did n’t , ”
65873	65893	65894	65894	He	225	“ Fuck , Nikki , I swear that I did n’t , though I probably should have expected it . ”
65935	65941	65912	65912	He	225	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
65942	65997	65912	65912	He	225	“ Why did you say no ? The proposal was amazing . The product is amazing . You were impressed — I know you were . And now Carl thinks that I snubbed you or fucked you or otherwise got under your skin enough that you want to get back at me through him . ”
65998	66004	65912	65912	He	225	“ He told you that ? ”
66005	66044	65912	65912	He	225	“ He has n’t told me shit . He did n’t even have the balls to fire me himself . But I ’m not an idiot . I know what it looks like and what he must think . ”
66045	66053	66054	66054	he	1406	“ You have gotten under my skin , ”
66057	66067	66054	66054	he	1406	“ But that ’s not why I said no . ”
66068	66089	65912	65912	He	225	“ Then why did you ? I mean , come on , Damien . It ’s a damn good product . ”
66090	66094	66095	66095	He	1406	“ It is . ”
66140	66145	66147	66147	I	5148	“ What are you — ”
66215	66260	66201	66201	Damien	5148	“ An Israeli company called Primo - Tech has already received a patent on a similar product . They have a marketing plan in place , and they ’re deep into beta testing . They expect to roll out the full product next month . ”
66266	66275	66261	66261	I	5148	“ Carl does n’t know anything about this . ”
66276	66314	66335	66335	he	5148	“ No ? Well , maybe he does n’t . Or maybe he was hoping that I would invest so that there would be enough capital behind his product to beat Primo - Tech in the marketplace . ”
66337	66388	66335	66335	he	5148	“ I do n’t play those kinds of games , Nikki . When I invest , it ’s because I have a clear path in the market . I said no to C - Squared because of the Primo - Tech product . It has nothing to do with you . ”
66392	66400	66389	66389	I	5148	“ I ’m glad to hear it . ”
66401	66412	66335	66335	he	5148	“ Would you like me to explain that to Carl ? ”
66413	66434	66389	66389	I	5148	“ Hell no . I do n’t want to work for a man who jumps to those kinds of conclusions . ”
66435	66438	66439	66439	He	5148	“ Good . ”
66456	66459	66389	66389	I	5148	“ What ? ”
66460	66464	66389	66389	I	5148	“ Nice suit . ”
66499	66526	66389	66389	I	5148	“ Not that I like to see you unemployed , but this works out well . Your day job was interfering with my plans for you . ”
66527	66530	66531	66531	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
66539	66564	66536	66536	I	5148	“ Yes , well , I ’m hardly joining the ranks of the idle masses . I ’ll need to find a new one . ”
66565	66568	66389	66389	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
66569	66588	66536	66536	I	5148	“ I have this thing about eating and paying my rent . I ’m just wacky that way . ”
66589	66624	66389	66389	I	5148	“ In case you forgot , you ’ll have a cool million in a week . For that matter , if you need money now , I ’m happy to advance you a portion . ”
66625	66649	66536	66536	I	5148	“ No , thanks . That money ’s going into the bank . I ’m not spending a dime until I ’m ready . ”
66650	66653	66389	66389	I	5148	“ Ready ? ”
66684	66690	66691	66691	His	5148	“ Secrets , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
66714	66729	66702	66702	I	5148	“ Shall I beg you to tell me what you intend for my money ? ”
66730	66750	66775	66775	His	5148	“ Your money , Mr. Stark ? I do n’t think so . I ’m earning every last penny . ”
66751	66755	66756	66756	he	5148	“ Oh yes , ”
66768	66774	66759	66759	His	5148	“ You most definitely are . ”
66873	66884	66885	66885	I	5148	“ Our time has n’t started yet , Mr. Stark , ”
66908	66917	66897	66897	he	5148	“ You ’re a tease , Ms. Fairchild . ”
66918	66933	66934	66934	He	5148	“ Am I ? Well , I guess you ’ll have to punish me . ”
66972	66975	66976	66976	His	5148	“ Nikki … ”
67022	67029	67011	67011	I	5148	“ Mr. Maynard on line two . ”
67030	67036	67011	67011	I	5148	“ Thank you , Sylvia . ”
67053	67056	67057	67057	he	5148	“ Charles , ”
67060	67066	67057	67057	he	5148	“ Give me an update . ”
67073	67076	67077	67077	he	5148	“ No , ”
67092	67194	67195	67195	His	355	“ You know damn well that I ’m not interested in playing games or idle threats . I will file a defamation action if this goes any further . Make sure he understands that . Yes , of course I realize that . No , Charles , I ’m not concerned about how difficult our case might be , I ’m interested in stopping the son of a bitch . Well , then I guess you ’ll just have to bill me for all those extra hours , sounds like a win - win as far as your firm is concerned . ”
67199	67217	67218	67218	He	355	“ Well , if he digs that up , then I ’ll really have to play hardball . ”
67227	67244	67245	67245	He	355	“ No , you know she would n’t . You took care of the new facility ? ”
67252	67270	67245	67245	He	355	“ Just make this go away , Charles . That ’s what I ’m paying you for . ”
67303	67312	67297	67298	Sara Padgett	337	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”
67329	67337	67313	67313	He	355	“ No . It ’s just business . ”
67371	67376	67361	67361	He	355	“ Come with me . ”
67386	67392	67379	67379	I	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
67393	67396	67397	67397	he	355	“ Lunch , ”
67400	67409	67379	67379	I	5148	“ But it ’s not even ten yet . ”
67415	67424	67410	67410	His	355	“ That should be just enough time . … ”
67460	67478	67454	67454	I	5148	“ Nice car . Looks familiar . Probably a lot of them in Los Angeles , huh ? ”
67479	67486	67487	67487	he	355	“ Hundreds , I ’m sure , ”
67570	67573	67574	67574	he	355	“ What ? ”
67581	67590	67574	67574	he	355	“ You ’re predictable , that ’s all . ”
67595	67599	67591	67591	His	355	“ Am I ? ”
67600	67622	67574	67574	he	355	“ What is this , some kind of fancy Ferrari ? I mean , what billionaire does n’t own a Ferrari ? ”
67623	67633	67634	67634	he	355	“ Ah , it ’s much worse than that , ”
67637	67687	67634	67634	he	355	“ This is a Bugatti Veyron . It costs about twice as much as a Ferrari . Nine hundred eighty - seven horsepower , a W16 engine , top speed of two hundred fifty - three , and she ’ll go from zero to sixty in under three seconds . ”
67695	67707	67688	67688	I	5148	“ In other words , you do n’t own a Ferrari ? ”
67708	67713	67719	67719	he	355	“ I own three . ”
67730	67744	67719	67719	he	355	“ Watch your head getting in . She ’s low to the ground . ”
67787	67793	67794	67794	I	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
67805	67809	67794	67794	I	5148	“ Santa Monica . ”
67831	67842	67794	67794	I	5148	“ Oh . So we ’re having an early lunch ? ”
67843	67849	67850	67850	he	355	“ The Santa Monica Airport , ”
67853	67863	67850	67850	he	355	“ That ’s where I keep the jet hangared . ”
67864	67870	67871	67871	I	5148	“ Of course it is . ”
67902	67911	67917	67917	he	355	“ And we ’re taking the jet where ? ”
67912	67916	67917	67917	he	355	“ Santa Barbara , ”
67920	67935	67917	67917	he	355	“ Really ? With this car , I ’d think we ’d just drive . ”
67936	67950	67951	67951	He	355	“ If I did n’t have a meeting at three , we would . ”
67973	67979	67917	67917	he	355	“ Yes , Mr. Stark ? ”
67980	68008	67917	67917	he	355	“ Sylvia , I ’m taking the Bombardier out . Call Grayson and get her ready and put in a flight plan for me to Santa Barbara . ”
68009	68025	67917	67917	he	355	“ Of course . Shall I arrange for a car to meet you at SBA ? ”
68026	68045	67917	67917	he	355	“ Yes . And let Richard know I ’m coming . We ’ll be dining on the terrace . ”
68046	68058	67917	67917	he	355	“ Consider it done . Enjoy your lunch , Mr. Stark . ”
68066	68071	67917	67917	he	355	“ She sounds efficient . ”
68072	68096	67917	67917	he	355	“ Sylvia ? She is . I expect only two things from my employees , loyalty and competence . Sylvia excels at both . ”
68162	68170	68171	68171	he	355	“ Looks like traffic is with us , ”
68219	68222	68223	68223	I	5148	“ Wow , ”
68236	68252	68229	68229	he	355	“ I ’d really open her up , but the cops tend to get testy . ”
68253	68268	68229	68229	he	355	“ Why buy a car like this if you ca n’t drive her fast ? ”
68275	68318	68269	68269	He	355	“ Spoken like a true pragmatist . I did n’t say I never drive her fast . But I ’m not willing to risk your life — or the lives of any of the other commuters stuck out here on the 10 . ”
68319	68325	68229	68229	he	355	“ I appreciate the courtesy . ”
68326	68353	68269	68269	He	355	“ But if you ’re interested , we can take her out to the desert one day and I ’ll show you what she can do . ”
68354	68364	68229	68229	he	355	“ Show me ? I ca n’t drive her ? ”
68371	68380	68365	68365	He	355	“ You know how to drive a stick ? ”
68381	68392	68393	68393	I	5148	“ I bought my Honda my second semester at UT , ”
68396	68431	68432	68432	I	5148	“ It had decrepit upholstery , primer instead of paint , and a standard transmission . I replaced the upholstery , painted it on the cheap , and learned how to work a clutch . ”
68500	68511	68517	68517	his	5148	“ In that case , maybe you can drive her . ”
68520	68529	68517	68517	his	5148	“ If you ’re very , very good . ”
68530	68539	68540	68540	I	5148	“ To have all this power beneath me ? ”
68550	68557	68540	68540	I	5148	“ I think that ’s incentive . ”
68564	68580	68561	68561	Damien	5148	“ Jesus , Nikki . I thought we were trying to avoid a traffic accident . ”
68661	68664	68665	68665	I	5148	“ Wow , ”
68686	68696	68673	68681	an older man with graying hair and a beard	1429	“ Is that Grayson ? Is he the pilot ? ”
68697	68702	68703	68703	Damien	5148	“ That is Grayson , ”
68706	68734	68703	68703	Damien	5148	“ And he ’s the mechanic , flight guru , and all - around grease monkey . Good morning , Grayson . She all ready to go ? ”
68735	68747	68673	68681	an older man with graying hair and a beard	1429	“ That she is . Great day for it , too . ”
68748	68762	68703	68703	Damien	5148	“ Grayson , this is Nikki Fairchild , my date for the afternoon . ”
68763	68769	68770	68770	he	5148	“ It ’s a pleasure , ”
68777	68785	68786	68786	I	5148	“ How long have you been flying ? ”
68790	68795	68796	68796	he	5148	“ Over fifty years , ”
68799	68823	68824	68824	He	5148	“ My dad used to take me up in his Cessna when I was a little thing and let me control the stick . ”
68841	68864	68824	68824	He	5148	“ She ’s fueled up and ready , but I know you ’re going to give her your own once - over . ”
68865	68872	68873	68873	He	5148	“ My bird , my responsibility . ”
68911	68917	68824	68824	He	5148	“ What ’s he doing ? ”
68918	68932	68933	68933	Grayson	5148	“ Checking for water in the fuel and for fluid in the lines , ”
68936	68960	68933	68933	Grayson	5148	“ I ’ve been prepping planes for him for five years now , and he ’s never once not double - checked me . ”
68961	68969	68824	68824	He	5148	“ Is n’t that a little annoying ? ”
68970	69006	68933	68933	Grayson	5148	“ Hell , no . It ’s the sign of a good pilot , and Damien Stark is a damn good pilot . I ought to know . I ’m the one who taught him . ”
69007	69010	69011	69011	I	5148	“ Pilot , ”
69025	69030	69015	69015	Damien	5148	“ You ’re flying ? ”
69031	69035	69036	69036	he	5148	“ I am , ”
69039	69042	69036	69036	he	5148	“ Ready ? ”
69051	69058	69043	69043	I	5148	“ You ’re in good hands . ”
69059	69063	69064	69064	Damien	5148	“ Very good , ”
69148	69154	69155	69155	he	5148	“ We ’re going left , ”
69215	69222	69223	69223	I	5148	“ Why not let Grayson fly ? ”
69226	69246	69223	69223	I	5148	“ Is n’t it a shame to forgo all that luxury and have to do all the hard work ? ”
69247	69265	69279	69279	His	5148	“ I have comfortable chairs and cocktails on the ground . Flying is where the thrill is . ”
69266	69270	69271	69271	I	5148	“ All right , ”
69274	69278	69271	69271	I	5148	“ Thrill me . ”
69284	69306	69279	69279	His	5148	“ I intend to , Ms. Fairchild . In the air , and when we ’re back safely on the ground . ”
69337	69340	69341	69341	he	5148	“ Ready ? ”
69413	69416	69410	69410	I	5148	“ Wow . ”
69484	69487	69467	69467	I	5148	“ Wow , ”
69512	69534	69501	69501	I	5148	“ I wish I ’d known we were going to do this . I ’d love to get some real shots . ”
69535	69562	69563	69563	He	5148	“ I doubt you could get anything decent through the glass . Grayson keeps it clean , but it ’s still going to cause some distortion . ”
69578	69587	69588	69588	he	5148	“ Do you shoot digitally or on film ? ”
69604	69607	69608	69608	I	5148	“ Film , ”
69611	69618	69608	69608	I	5148	“ My camera ’s pretty old . ”
69619	69627	69638	69638	Damien	5148	“ Do you develop your own film ? ”
69628	69631	69632	69632	I	5148	“ No . ”
69649	69661	69646	69646	he	5148	“ I did n’t realize that was such a loaded question . ”
69662	69673	69674	69674	I	5148	“ I ’m not crazy about small , dark spaces , ”
69677	69680	69674	69674	I	5148	“ Claustrophobia ? ”
69681	69695	69696	69696	I	5148	“ I guess . It ’s being enclosed in the dark , mostly . ”
69701	69713	69696	69696	I	5148	“ And locked rooms . I do n’t like feeling trapped . ”
69760	69763	69764	69764	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
69768	69778	69764	69764	I	5148	“ You do n’t have anything to apologize for . ”
69779	69797	69764	69764	I	5148	“ I should be over it . It ’s stupid . Just childhood crap , you know ? ”
69798	69808	69809	69809	he	5148	“ Things that happen in childhood stay with you , ”
69920	69935	69936	69936	I	5148	“ My mother had me competing in pageants from the time I was four , ”
69939	69964	69936	69936	I	5148	“ She was strict about a lot of things , but the one we battled the most on was me getting my beauty sleep . ”
69965	69971	69972	69972	he	5148	“ What did she do ? ”
69993	70067	69936	69936	I	5148	“ At first , she just told me lights out at whatever time she set for my bedtime . Always at least two hours before my friends . I was never tired , so I ’d go to bed , turn out the lights , then pull out a flashlight and play with my stuffed animals . When I got older , I ’d read . She caught me one too many times . ”
70093	70155	70156	70156	I	5148	“ She started searching my room . Taking away my flashlight . Then she moved my bedroom to an interior room so that I did n’t have a window , because there was some light that crept in from a streetlamp , and she ’d read somewhere that you can only truly sleep well if you ’re in pitch - black . ”
70161	70190	70156	70156	I	5148	“ And then she put a lock on my door . From the outside . And had an electrician move the light switch to the outside , too . ”
70229	70235	70239	70239	Stark	5148	“ Your father did nothing ? ”
70245	70287	70239	70239	Stark	5148	“ I do n’t know my dad . They divorced when I was a baby . He lives somewhere in Europe now . I almost told my grandfather once , but I never quite worked up the courage before he died . ”
70288	70293	70294	70294	He	5148	“ That horrific bitch . ”
70332	70339	70327	70327	I	5148	“ My sister tried to help . ”
70376	70389	70371	70372	our mother	5292	“ She did n’t have to have her beauty sleep , too ? ”
70390	70407	70418	70418	her	5292	“ She did n’t win enough , so my mom eventually quit entering her in pageants . ”
70467	70479	70480	70480	I	5148	“ I really do n’t want to talk about it anymore , ”
70498	70527	70483	70483	He	1454	“ I thought I knew a bit about photography , but I guess I know less than I thought . I always assumed some light was allowed in . ”
70560	70571	70572	70572	I	5148	“ At a certain point in the process , yes , ”
70590	70649	70587	70587	I	5148	“ And a red or amber safelight is common when making black and white prints because most of the papers are sensitive only to blue or blue - green light . But if you ’re working with color like I usually do , then the prints need to be kept in total darkness until they ’re properly fixed . ”
70653	70729	70650	70650	I	5148	“ It ’s really not a big deal . Access to a darkroom is expensive and doing your own developing eats up a lot of time . One of these days I ’ll get a digital camera , but in the meantime , I send my film out and get back a contact sheet along with all the pictures on disk . Then I sit down and play with the images in my native environment . ”
70730	70734	70735	70735	he	1454	“ The computer ? ”
70740	70752	70753	70753	I	5148	“ Ever since I got my first one at age ten , ”
70824	70839	70840	70840	I	5148	“ Doing photographic work on the computer is like holding magic in your hand , ”
70843	70876	70877	70877	I	5148	“ I mean , I could take a picture of you and then find stock footage of the surface of the moon and make it look like you ’re standing in space . ”
70881	70894	70877	70877	I	5148	“ Or I could put your head on the body of monkey . ”
70895	70910	70840	70840	I	5148	“ I ’m not sure that would show me off to my best advantage . ”
70916	70923	70911	70911	I	5148	“ No , it would n’t . ”
70924	70940	70941	70941	he	5148	“ That ’s one of the apps you have for sale , is n’t it ? ”
71018	71026	71027	71027	I	5148	“ How did you know about that ? ”
71054	71072	71073	71073	He	5148	“ I make it a point to know everything I can about the things I care about . ”
71178	71190	71191	71191	he	5148	“ I ’ve always thought of science as magic , too , ”
71202	71209	71191	71191	he	5148	“ Though not just computer science . ”
71210	71222	71223	71223	I	5148	“ I was pretty impressed with your questions during the pitch , ”
71254	71262	71223	71223	I	5148	“ What did you study in college ? ”
71263	71271	71272	71272	he	5148	“ I did n’t go to college , ”
71275	71307	71272	71272	he	5148	“ For that matter , I did n’t go to school . I had private tutors from the time I was ten . My coach insisted , and my father agreed . ”
71334	71344	71345	71345	I	5148	“ So , do you know much about photography ? ”
71365	71375	71356	71356	I	5148	“ Did you take the pictures outside your office ? ”
71376	71385	71386	71386	he	5148	“ I know just enough to be dangerous , ”
71400	71432	71386	71386	he	5148	“ And no . I tried to find photos that represent my hobbies . Those are done by a local photographer . He has a studio in Santa Monica , actually . ”
71433	71448	71356	71356	I	5148	“ He ’s very skilled . His use of contrast and perspective is stunning . ”
71449	71465	71386	71386	he	5148	“ I agree , and I ’m flattered you thought I might be the photographer . ”
71477	71493	71466	71466	I	5148	“ Well , you are a remarkably talented man . And very full of surprises . ”
71526	71565	71517	71517	I	5148	“ Your hobbies , huh ? So there were photographs of the ocean , some mountains , redwoods , and a bike tire . I ’m guessing sailing , skiing , I have no idea , and biking . ”
71566	71600	71499	71499	Damien	5148	“ Not bad . The ocean represents diving and the trees are for hiking . Other than that , you got it right . Any of those appeal to you , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
71601	71606	71607	71607	I	5148	“ All of them , ”
71610	71624	71607	71607	I	5148	“ Although I ’ve never tried diving . Not many opportunities in Texas . ”
71625	71631	71632	71632	he	5148	“ California has excellent diving , ”
71635	71656	71657	71657	he	5148	“ Though a wetsuit is a bit cumbersome . I much prefer the warmer waters of the Caribbean . There , ”
71686	71710	71657	71657	he	5148	“ I ’ll need to put her into the landing pattern soon , but why do n’t you take control for a bit . ”
71711	71714	71715	71715	I	5148	“ What ? ”
71726	71734	71715	71715	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , but what ? ”
71735	71740	71741	71741	he	5148	“ It ’s easy , ”
71817	71822	71823	71823	I	5148	“ Oh , fuck , ”
71833	71845	71826	71826	he	5148	“ Shit , Stark ! What am I supposed to do ? ”
71846	71876	71823	71823	I	5148	“ You ’re doing it . Just keep her steady . Push in , we descend . Pull out , we climb . Go ahead , pull out gently . ”
71884	71893	71881	71881	He	5148	“ Go on . Give it a try . ”
71912	71918	71919	71919	Damien	5148	“ I like that sound , ”
71922	71935	71936	71936	He	5148	“ I think I need to hear that sound on the ground . ”
71961	71974	71951	71951	I	5148	“ There you go , baby . Okay , steady it out . ”
71992	71996	71987	71987	He	5148	“ Good job . ”
72021	72026	72027	72027	I	5148	“ I am flying , ”
72030	72036	72027	72027	I	5148	“ I am really flying . ”
72037	72040	72041	72041	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
72044	72050	72041	72041	he	5148	“ And you will again . ”
72135	72140	72141	72141	I	5148	“ This is amazing , ”
72144	72152	72141	72141	I	5148	“ How did you find this place ? ”
72153	72159	72160	72160	he	5148	“ It was n’t difficult , ”
72163	72169	72160	72160	he	5148	“ I own the hotel . ”
72179	72191	72170	72170	I	5148	“ Is there anything you do n’t own , Mr. Stark ? ”
72200	72211	72192	72192	He	5148	“ At the moment , everything I want is mine . ”
72224	72243	72192	72192	He	5148	“ Do n’t worry , Ms. Fairchild . I take very good care of the things I own . ”
72332	72342	72318	72318	He	1472	“ This just arrived for you , Mr. Stark . ”
72343	72349	72318	72318	He	1472	“ Thank you , Richard . ”
72360	72368	72351	72351	Richard	1751	“ I believe this is for you . ”
72369	72372	72373	72373	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
72409	72422	72397	72397	I	5148	“ You like ? It ’s digital . Top of the line . ”
72423	72428	72429	72429	I	5148	“ It ’s wonderful . ”
72432	72447	72429	72429	I	5148	“ You ’re amazing , Mr. Stark . You just blink and things happen . ”
72448	72475	72397	72397	I	5148	“ A bit more than a blink , but it was worth the extra effort . How else will you get shots of the beach today ? ”
72487	72503	72476	72476	I	5148	“ I can see the ocean from here , but not much of the beach . ”
72504	72517	72397	72397	I	5148	“ The view will be better when we ’re walking on it . ”
72534	72546	72518	72518	I	5148	“ I do n’t think I ’m dressed for the occasion . ”
72571	72576	72577	72577	I	5148	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
72580	72585	72586	72586	he	5148	“ Beauty for beauty , ”
72589	72596	72586	72586	he	5148	“ The emeralds match your eyes . ”
72602	72611	72597	72597	I	5148	“ I ’m feeling showered with gifts lately . ”
72612	72627	72628	72628	he	5148	“ Good . You deserve to be . And that ’s not a gift , ”
72638	72648	72649	72649	He	5148	“ It ’s a bond … and a promise . ”
72667	72681	72682	72682	I	5148	“ I do n’t want to miss walking on the beach with you , ”
72692	72698	72682	72682	I	5148	“ I can go barefoot . ”
72702	72715	72699	72699	He	5148	“ You could . But have you looked under the camera box ? ”
72716	72719	72720	72720	I	5148	“ Under ? ”
72800	72807	72808	72808	he	5148	“ For walking on the beach , ”
72811	72815	72808	72808	he	5148	“ Thank you . ”
72816	72825	72792	72792	I	5148	“ Anything you want . Anything you need . ”
72826	72833	72834	72834	I	5148	“ Not everything can be bought , ”
72837	72840	72841	72841	he	5148	“ No , ”
72852	72860	72845	72845	he	5148	“ But I stand by my promise . ”
72915	72924	72925	72925	I	5148	“ What else did you do this weekend ? ”
72929	72933	72925	72925	I	5148	“ I worked . ”
72934	72939	72978	72978	I	5148	“ Earn another billion ? ”
72940	72953	72925	72925	I	5148	“ Not quite , but the time was profitable . And you ? ”
72954	72957	72958	72958	I	5148	“ Laundry , ”
72961	72969	72958	72958	I	5148	“ And we went dancing Saturday night . ”
72970	72973	72925	72925	I	5148	“ We ? ”
72974	72977	72978	72978	I	5148	“ Ollie , ”
72981	72988	72978	72978	I	5148	“ And my roommate , Jamie . ”
73023	73032	72925	72925	I	5148	“ Shall I take you dancing this week ? ”
73033	73039	73040	73040	I	5148	“ I ’d like that , ”
73043	73053	73040	73040	I	5148	“ Where did you go with Jamie and Ollie ? ”
73054	73058	73059	73059	I	5148	“ Westerfield ’s , ”
73063	73077	73059	73059	I	5148	“ It ’s that new place on Sunset close to the St. Regis . ”
73078	73081	73082	73082	He	5148	“ Mmm . ”
73097	73103	73104	73104	I	5148	“ Too wild for you ? ”
73107	73116	73104	73104	I	5148	“ That harsh beat ? Those bright lights ? ”
73184	73191	73237	73237	his	5148	“ Did you like Westerfield ’s ? ”
73192	73226	73227	73227	I	5148	“ I did . But , you know , I just left college , and Austin has a lot of clubs . So the loud music and the heavy beat do n’t really — ”
73251	73261	73240	73240	I	5148	“ You own the place , do n’t you ? ”
73262	73272	73237	73237	his	5148	“ As a matter of fact , I do . ”
73273	73286	73240	73240	I	5148	“ Hotels . Clubs . What happened to your little technology empire ? ”
73287	73293	73294	73294	he	5148	“ Empires are often widespread , ”
73297	73318	73294	73294	he	5148	“ I believe there ’s strength in having a varied portfolio . And my empire is not little at all . ”
73319	73325	73326	73326	I	5148	“ I pegged you wrong , ”
73329	73333	73326	73326	I	5148	“ Did you ? ”
73334	73367	73368	73368	I	5148	“ I was picturing us as Fred and Ginger . When you take me dancing , I mean . But I ’m okay with a nasty little bump and grind , too . ”
73430	73437	73399	73399	He	5148	“ Smoke Gets in Your Eyes , ”
73456	73466	73447	73447	He	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild , may I have this dance ? ”
73592	73603	73608	73608	He	5148	“ Is there something on your mind , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
73604	73607	73608	73608	He	5148	“ No . ”
73625	73634	73608	73608	He	5148	“ I just — I was just wondering . ”
73635	73639	73640	73640	He	5148	“ Wondering what ? ”
73668	73672	73673	73673	he	5148	“ Tell me , ”
73688	73700	73701	73701	He	5148	“ I was wondering if you were going to kiss me . ”
73736	73739	73740	73740	he	5148	“ No , ”
73766	73769	73770	73770	he	5148	“ No , ”
73791	73803	73780	73780	He	5148	“ Our week begins when you arrive for your first sitting . ”
73804	73807	73808	73808	I	5148	“ Tonight ? ”
73811	73815	73780	73780	He	5148	“ At six . ”
73840	73845	73846	73846	he	5148	“ And , Nikki , ”
73849	73863	73846	73846	he	5148	“ do n’t bother wearing underwear . You really wo n’t need any . ”
73948	73957	73958	73958	I	5148	“ Not a lot of hotels have courts , ”
73961	73967	73958	73958	I	5148	“ Was that your idea ? ”
73968	73979	73980	73980	Damien	5148	“ The courts were here when I bought the place , ”
74074	74079	74080	74080	he	5148	“ We should go , ”
74083	74104	74080	74080	he	5148	“ I want to show you the wharf , and I need to be back in the office by three . ”
74105	74113	74114	74114	I	5148	“ Oh . Sure . I forgot . ”
74139	74145	74146	74146	I	5148	“ Do you miss it ? ”
74182	74188	74146	74146	I	5148	“ Tennis , I mean . ”
74189	74192	74193	74193	His	5148	“ No . ”
74234	74261	74231	74231	he	5148	“ At first , I loved it . But after a while , the fun went out of the game . There was too much baggage . ”
74262	74266	74267	74267	I	5148	“ The competition ? ”
74270	74296	74267	74267	I	5148	“ Maybe you could get the fun back if you just played . I ’m terrible , but we could hit a ball around sometime . ”
74297	74304	74305	74305	he	5148	“ I do n’t play anymore , ”
74325	74328	74329	74329	I	5148	“ Okay . ”
74363	74368	74360	74360	Damien	5148	“ I ’m sorry . ”
74383	74394	74369	74369	He	5148	“ No , I ’m the one who ’s sorry . ”
74411	74438	74395	74395	He	5148	“ It ’s just that I ’m done with tennis . Like you ’re done with pageants . You do n’t compete anymore , do you ? ”
74442	74459	74439	74439	I	5148	“ Hell no . But there ’s a difference . I never thought it was fun . ”
74495	74498	74487	74487	He	5148	“ Never ? ”
74499	74502	74503	74503	I	5148	“ Never , ”
74506	74556	74503	74503	I	5148	“ Well , maybe when I was little I liked the dressing up . I honestly do n’t remember . But , no , I do n’t think I liked it even then . I ca n’t remember feeling like anything other than my mother ’s personal Barbie doll . ”
74557	74569	74570	74570	he	5148	“ And dolls do n’t have a life of their own , ”
74573	74580	74581	74581	I	5148	“ No , they do n’t , ”
74591	74600	74581	74581	I	5148	“ Did your parents push you to play ? ”
74672	74735	74653	74653	I	5148	“ At first I liked it . Loved it , actually . I was so damn young , but even then I loved the precision and the timing . And the power . Damn , I could hit that ball . It was a crappy year — my mother was sick — and I took out all my frustration on the court . ”
74801	74865	74797	74797	they	5035	“ I started staying after school and the gym teacher coached me , but pretty soon he said that I ’d blown past him . My dad worked in a factory and I knew that we could n’t afford a coach , but that was okay . I was a kid , only eight , and I just wanted to play for fun . ”
74866	74870	74791	74791	They	5035	“ What changed ? ”
74871	74932	74797	74797	they	5035	“ The teacher knew my mom was sick and that we could n’t afford lessons . He mentioned me to a friend , and before I knew it this local pro was working with me , free of charge . I loved it , especially when I started winning tournaments . You might have noticed that I ’m slightly competitive . ”
74933	74940	74941	74941	I	5148	“ You ? I ’m flabbergasted . ”
75176	75184	75185	75185	I	5148	“ Will you tell me the rest ? ”
75188	75194	75185	75185	I	5148	“ What changed for you ? ”
75195	75198	75199	75199	he	5148	“ Success , ”
75209	75215	75203	75203	I	5148	“ I do n’t understand . ”
75216	75230	75231	75231	His	5148	“ I got good enough to attract a bastard of a professional coach . ”
75243	75263	75231	75231	His	5148	“ He made a deal with my father — he’d train me for a percentage of my prize money . ”
75341	75352	75338	75338	I	5148	“ Did competing make it shift from fun to work ? ”
75395	75403	75404	75404	he	5148	“ I do n’t mind hard work , ”
75408	75417	75404	75404	he	5148	“ But everything changed when I was nine . ”
75443	75447	75423	75423	his	5148	“ What happened ? ”
75448	75471	75436	75436	he	5148	“ I told my father I wanted to quit , but I was already earning prize money , and he said no . ”
75504	75607	75480	75480	he	5148	“ I tried to get out again about a year later . I was playing all over the country by then , internationally , too . I was missing so damn much school that my dad just hired tutors . I focused mostly on science , and I loved it . I read everything I could on every subject , from astronomy to physics to biology . And fiction . Man , I ate up sci - fi novels . I even secretly applied to a private science academy . They not only accepted me , they offered me a full scholarship . ”
75656	75662	75639	75639	he	1507	“ Your parents said no . ”
75663	75668	75669	75669	Damien	5148	“ My father did , ”
75672	75684	75685	75685	He	5148	“ My mother had died a year earlier . It was — ”
75718	75746	75747	75747	His	5148	“ I was ripped up the year she died . Numb . I let it all out on the court . All the anger , the betrayal . ”
75755	75768	75747	75747	His	5148	“ Hell , it ’s probably why I played so damn good . ”
75769	75774	75775	75775	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
75784	75818	75775	75775	I	5148	“ I knew you were attracted to the sciences . All anyone has to do is look at the businesses you ’re in . But I never realized it was a lifelong fascination . ”
75819	75824	75747	75747	His	5148	“ Why would you ? ”
75834	75884	75825	75825	I	5148	“ You ’re not exactly a blank slate , Mr. Stark . In case you have n’t noticed , you ’re something of a celebrity . You ’ve even got a Wikipedia page . But there ’s nothing on it about turning down a scholarship to a science academy . ”
75893	75911	75885	75885	His	5148	“ I ’ve worked hard to keep my past off the Internet and away from the press . ”
76000	76004	76005	76005	he	5148	“ Bad girl , ”
76013	76019	76020	76020	I	5148	“ You bought the camera , ”
76023	76033	76020	76020	I	5148	“ You have no one to blame but yourself . ”
76034	76039	76040	76040	he	5148	“ Oh , no , ”
76091	76100	76101	76101	he	5148	“ And she keeps piling on the punishment , ”
76131	76141	76123	76123	I	5148	“ I ’m a free agent today , remember . ”
76148	76159	76160	76160	he	5148	“ I may not be allowed to act on it , ”
76163	76179	76160	76160	he	5148	“ but that does n’t mean I ca n’t keep a list for future reference . ”
76180	76185	76186	76186	I	5148	“ Oh , really ? ”
76193	76211	76186	76186	I	5148	“ If I ’m going to be punished anyway , it might as well be worth it . ”
76220	76230	76212	76212	His	5148	“ I assure you I ’ll be very thorough . ”
76231	76272	76212	76212	His	5148	“ Of course , I do n’t think you ’re being very equitable . I mean , fair is fair . You ’re going to have a portrait of me . I think I should have some photos of you . ”
76273	76277	76278	76278	he	5148	“ Nice try , ”
76281	76287	76278	76278	he	5148	“ But the punishment stands . ”
76340	76356	76324	76324	I	5148	“ What would you say if I told you I was looking forward to it ? ”
76521	76532	76533	76533	he	5148	“ I ’m looking forward to tonight , Ms. Fairchild , ”
76565	76586	76551	76551	I	5148	“ It ’s hard to be so close to something so precious and know you do n’t yet possess it . ”
76587	76590	76591	76591	I	5148	“ Possess ? ”
76601	76631	76594	76594	His	5148	“ Possess . Have . Hold . Enjoy . Control . Dominate . Pick your verb , Ms. Fairchild . I intend to explore so very many of them . ”
76637	76645	76632	76632	I	5148	“ Now you ’re breaking the rules . ”
76646	76655	76656	76656	He	5148	“ Oh , I do n’t think so . ”
76661	76674	76675	76675	He	5148	“ No touching . No demands . You ’re not mine yet . ”
76681	76689	76690	76690	he	5148	“ Not for a few more hours , ”
76720	76726	76727	76727	I	5148	“ Totally free for now , ”
76746	76754	76755	76755	he	5148	“ So I have no authority now , ”
76765	76844	76755	76755	he	5148	“ I ca n’t tell you to touch yourself . I ca n’t insist that you lie naked in the surf and slide your fingers over your cunt . I ca n’t take you back to the pool and ease you in , then suck on your nipples while the water washes the sand from your body . I ca n’t slide my fingers inside you and feel how slick you are , how much you want me . ”
76978	77044	76972	76972	I	5148	“ I ca n’t take you into the hot tub and turn you around so that I can fuck you from behind while the water jet strokes your clit . I ca n’t clutch your breasts and fuck you harder while you come for me , exploding all around me . And I ca n’t make love to you on a balcony under the stars . ”
77052	77059	77060	77060	he	5148	“ I ca n’t , Nikki , ”
77063	77076	77077	77077	he	5148	“ because you ’re not mine yet . But I can soon , ”
77080	77097	77077	77077	he	5148	“ Soon I can do whatever I want with you . I hope you ’re ready . ”
77186	77203	77169	77169	Damien	5148	“ This is Edward , one of my drivers . He ’ll be taking you home . ”
77204	77213	77169	77169	Damien	5148	“ You ’re going back to your office ? ”
77214	77232	77169	77169	Damien	5148	“ I ’m so sorry to cut our afternoon short , but it ca n’t be avoided . ”
77233	77266	77169	77169	Damien	5148	“ No , no . Obviously you have work to do . It ’s just that my car is in the parking garage . Why do n’t I ride back with you ? ”
77284	77299	77275	77275	Edward	366	“ I would love the company , but your car is at your apartment . ”
77308	77317	77302	77302	me	5148	“ What ? How did it get there ? ”
77318	77323	77275	77275	Edward	366	“ I arranged it . ”
77324	77329	77330	77330	I	5148	“ You arranged it , ”
77359	77367	77350	77350	I	5148	“ You just did that without asking ? ”
77372	77380	77368	77368	He	225	“ I thought you ’d appreciate it . ”
77381	77397	77398	77398	I	5148	“ That ’s micromanaging my life and putting your sticky fingers all over my property . ”
77412	77419	77398	77398	I	5148	“ I think you ’re overreacting . ”
77491	77494	77495	77495	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
77515	77529	77499	77499	I	5148	“ You ’re probably right . Just ask first next time , okay ? ”
77530	77537	77538	77538	he	5148	“ I was trying to help , ”
77587	77597	77598	77598	I	5148	“ You can just drop me on the Promenade , ”
77610	77626	77598	77598	I	5148	“ I ’ll either catch a taxi home or have my roommate pick me up . ”
77627	77635	77636	77636	he	366	“ I ’m sorry , Ms. Fairchild , ”
77650	77660	77636	77636	he	366	“ My instructions are to take you straight home . ”
77668	77671	77672	77672	I	5148	“ Instructions ? ”
77675	77683	77672	77672	I	5148	“ Do n’t I get a say ? ”
77717	77722	77723	77723	His	366	“ Hey , baby . ”
77763	77800	77754	77754	I	5148	“ Would you please tell Edward that he does n’t have to take me straight home ? He seems to be under the impression that you were giving orders and not just telling him a destination . ”
77809	77829	77804	77804	he	366	“ You need to be ready at six . It ’s already past two . You need to rest . ”
77830	77835	77836	77836	I	5148	“ What the fuck ? ”
77839	77845	77836	77836	I	5148	“ Are you my mother ? ”
77846	77860	77804	77804	he	366	“ It ’s been a long day , baby . You ’re tired . ”
77861	77867	77869	77869	he	366	“ The hell I am . ”
77887	77891	77892	77892	he	366	“ No lying , ”
77895	77898	77892	77892	he	366	“ Remember . ”
77899	77902	77903	77903	I	5148	“ Fine , ”
77907	77924	77925	77925	I	5148	“ I am tired . I ’m also pissed . See you tonight , Mr. Stark . ”
78118	78125	78159	78159	He	366	“ It just came for you , ”
78147	78158	78159	78159	He	366	“ Sorry , I did n’t mean to scare you . ”
78211	78215	78216	78216	I	5148	“ Just came ? ”
78219	78241	78216	78216	I	5148	“ About five minutes ago . I put it on the table for you . It does n’t weigh a thing . ”
78396	78402	78403	78403	he	366	“ Who ’s it from ? ”
78406	78410	78411	78411	I	5148	“ Long story , ”
78419	78434	78411	78411	I	5148	“ So what happened to you yesterday ? Jamie said she invited you over . ”
78435	78475	78488	78488	he	366	“ Yeah , well , you know . I had stuff to do around the house , and then Courtney came back early from the conference , so we did the engaged - couple - hang - out thing . ”
78476	78483	78411	78411	I	5148	“ What ’s she doing today ? ”
78484	78487	78488	78488	he	366	“ Work , ”
78491	78498	78488	78488	he	366	“ Same old , same old . ”
78499	78502	78503	78503	I	5148	“ Right . ”
78547	78558	78559	78559	I	5148	“ Why is she at work and you ’re not ? ”
78570	78578	78579	78579	he	366	“ Deposition ended earlier than I expected , ”
78582	78591	78579	78579	he	366	“ So I decided to come hang here . ”
78592	78630	78638	78638	he	366	“ That ’s great . You did n’t come to see me , did you ? Sorry I was n’t here . Starting tomorrow , though , you might actually find me at home during the day . ”
78644	78667	78638	78638	he	366	“ No , I popped by to see Jamie . You know , to make up for blowing off her invitation yesterday . ”
78668	78671	78672	78672	I	5148	“ Cool . ”
78682	78690	78672	78672	I	5148	“ So where is she , anyway ? ”
78691	78737	78738	78738	He	366	“ Um , the bathroom . She ’s taking a shower . I think she ’s going out in a bit . I told her I ’d hang out for a while and watch some screen , but now I think I ’m getting hungry . ”
78741	78750	78738	78738	He	366	“ Why do n’t we go grab something ? ”
78756	78765	78751	78751	I	5148	“ I ’m stuffed . You go on . ”
78766	78786	78787	78787	He	366	“ At least come sit with me . I ’m just going around the corner to the Daily Grill . ”
78812	78830	78804	78804	he	366	“ Do you want me to make you something ? We have a ton of leftover pizza . ”
78831	78843	78844	78844	He	366	“ Nah . I ’m craving their burger . You coming ? ”
78879	78882	78883	78883	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
78886	78893	78883	78883	I	5148	“ Just give me a sec . ”
78916	78922	78923	78923	Jamie	1450	“ Do n’t be coy , ”
78926	78932	78923	78923	Jamie	1450	“ Just come on in . ”
79021	79037	79071	79071	she	1450	“ Hey , Nik ! Why are you home in the middle of the day ? ”
79038	79049	79050	79050	I	5148	“ What the hell do you think you ’re doing ? ”
79053	79065	79050	79050	I	5148	“ He ’s engaged . Off limits . Jesus , Jamie . ”
79066	79069	79071	79071	she	1450	“ I — ”
79086	79089	79095	79095	me	5148	“ Shit . ”
79097	79104	79105	79105	I	5148	“ Shit , damn , fuck . ”
79120	79126	79105	79105	I	5148	“ Did you fuck him ? ”
79186	79191	79192	79192	I	5148	“ Jesus , Ollie , ”
79206	79218	79201	79201	he	837	“ I fucked up , Nik . What can I say ? ”
79256	79293	79254	79254	Jamie	1450	“ It had to be Jamie ? You could n’t have fucked someone I do n’t love ? You guys are my best friends — I do n’t want to be in the middle of this . ”
79294	79329	79254	79254	Jamie	1450	“ I know . I do . I ’m sorry . Look , come get some lunch with me . I’ll — we can talk . Or not talk . Just come , okay ? ”
79333	79351	79330	79330	I	5148	“ I ’ll just have a tea or something . I had a huge lunch with Damien . ”
79352	79355	79356	79356	he	5148	“ Damien , ”
79377	79387	79367	79367	I	5148	“ Christ , Nik . He ’s bad news . ”
79388	79394	79395	79395	I	5148	“ Do n’t you dare , ”
79411	79466	79395	79395	I	5148	“ Do n’t you dare give me that shit . You ca n’t stand here and tell me you do n’t like Damien Stark . You ca n’t toss something like that at me and stand there like you ’ve got the moral high ground beneath your feet , because you so do not . ”
79467	79475	79476	79476	He	5148	“ You ’re right — you’re right . ”
79486	79535	79476	79476	He	5148	“ Listen , I ’m just gon na get a burger and head back to the office . We should talk tomorrow , okay ? You can berate me about Jamie all you want . And maybe I ’ll even have some shit to tell you , too . ”
79536	79540	79541	79541	I	5148	“ About Damien ? ”
79553	79565	79545	79545	He	5148	“ I ’m going to just — I really am sorry . ”
81327	81334	81324	81324	I	5148	“ Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . ”
81429	81432	81433	81433	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
81436	81440	81433	81433	I	5148	“ I thought — ”
81441	81446	81447	81447	Edward	366	“ Mr. Stark apologizes , ”
81450	81456	81447	81447	Edward	366	“ He got held up . ”
81457	81461	81462	81462	I	5148	“ I see . ”
82126	82135	82136	82136	Edward	366	“ Mr. Stark will be right with you , ”
82409	82415	82384	82384	He	5148	“ I like that view . ”
82443	82453	82427	82427	I	5148	“ Then why do n’t you come enjoy it ? ”
82489	82498	82499	82499	he	5148	“ I told you not to wear underwear , ”
82502	82507	82508	82508	I	5148	“ I did n’t , ”
82591	82594	82595	82595	he	5148	“ Mmm , ”
82620	82652	82610	82610	I	5148	“ And no more jeans . I want you only in skirts . No underwear . A garter if you want stockings . I want you accessible . Anytime , anywhere . ”
82667	82675	82676	82676	He	5148	“ God , you ’re so responsive . ”
82693	82699	82700	82700	he	5148	“ Keep your eyes closed , ”
82713	82716	82717	82717	he	5148	“ Suck , ”
82767	82770	82771	82771	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
82774	82777	82778	82778	he	5148	“ Mine , ”
82869	82882	82861	82862	Damien Stark	5148	“ Well , hello . I take it you like the bed ? ”
82896	82901	82883	82883	I	5148	“ Is it yours ? ”
82902	82905	82906	82906	he	5148	“ No , ”
82909	82935	82906	82906	he	5148	“ Not the way you mean . It ’s for the portrait . And this week . That means it ’s yours , I suppose . ”
82949	82953	82943	82943	I	5148	“ Or ours . ”
82957	82983	82954	82954	I	5148	“ Well , you ’ve staged a lovely room . I ’m sure the portrait will be wonderful . When is the artist getting here ? ”
82984	82990	82991	82991	Damien	5148	“ He ’s already here , ”
83004	83022	83023	83023	He	5148	“ Do n’t worry , he ’s in the kitchen . I do n’t do public sex . ”
83028	83036	83037	83037	he	5148	“ I do everything else , though , ”
83051	83054	83023	83023	He	5148	“ everything else ”
83058	83061	83062	83062	he	5148	“ Blaine , ”
83065	83076	83062	83062	he	5148	“ Why do n’t you bring your coffee in here . ”
83077	83080	83081	83081	I	5148	“ Blaine ? ”
83084	83095	83081	83081	I	5148	“ I thought you did n’t care for his work . ”
83096	83160	83062	83062	he	5148	“ On the contrary . I think his skill is exceptional . He conveys an intense eroticism . I simply was n’t impressed with his models or with the staging . I want that same erotic allure , but without the trappings . I ’ll tie you up , Nikki , but I wo n’t put a picture of it on my wall . ”
83230	83243	83221	83221	He	2099	“ Great to see you again , Nikki . Are you nervous ? ”
83244	83248	83249	83249	I	5148	“ Hell yes , ”
83257	83271	83249	83249	I	5148	“ Do n’t worry . I ’m like a doctor . Purely clinical . ”
83277	83313	83249	83249	I	5148	“ Okay , that ’s not entirely true . But I appreciate beauty , and I get off on capturing it . It ’s personal , but it ’s not . Does that make sense ? ”
83314	83318	83319	83319	I	5148	“ It does , ”
83327	83339	83249	83249	I	5148	“ We have to trust each other . Work for you ? ”
83340	83345	83249	83249	I	5148	“ I ’ll try . ”
83346	83359	83249	83249	I	5148	“ And just so you know , I signed Damien ’s agreement . ”
83379	83384	83385	83385	he	2099	“ The confidentiality agreement , ”
83388	83418	83385	83385	he	2099	“ I ’m not allowed to talk about you or the sessions . And once it ’s done , I ’m not allowed to reveal who the model is . ”
83419	83422	83423	83423	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
83483	83489	83490	83490	he	2099	“ It will hang there , ”
83493	83511	83490	83490	he	2099	“ You ’ll be looking out on the ocean . You ’ll see the sunset every night . ”
83515	83521	83512	83512	I	5148	“ Where ’s the canvas ? ”
83548	83551	83552	83552	Blaine	2099	“ Tomorrow , ”
83555	83578	83552	83552	Blaine	2099	“ Today ’s about getting us familiar with each other . I sketch your curves , you stand there and look fabulous . ”
83579	83588	83589	83589	I	5148	“ I think you have the easier job , ”
83593	83600	83601	83601	he	2099	“ Hell yeah , I do , ”
83609	83615	83616	83616	I	5148	“ I ’m still nervous , ”
83619	83623	83624	83624	Blaine	2099	“ Totally normal , ”
83670	83677	83678	83678	I	5148	“ Do you have any wine ? ”
83690	83694	83681	83681	He	2099	“ Of course . ”
83746	83749	83750	83750	I	5148	“ Okay , ”
83762	83771	83750	83750	I	5148	“ Yeah . I think that ’s better . ”
83786	83796	83797	83797	he	2099	“ I want you standing , not passed out , ”
83811	83819	83806	83806	He	2099	“ The first moment is the hardest . ”
83820	83835	83806	83806	He	2099	“ And you know this because of the many times you ’ve posed naked ? ”
83836	83839	83840	83840	he	2099	“ Touché , ”
83843	83848	83840	83840	he	2099	“ Take your time . ”
83849	83854	83855	83855	Blaine	2099	“ By the window , ”
83870	83885	83855	83855	Blaine	2099	“ Close to the drapes . Damien , where ’d you put that robe ? ”
83910	83967	83899	83899	Damien	5148	“ Just put it on the bed — the far side so it ’s not in my composition . Yeah , that ’s right . Okay , Nikki , right there . Do you want to put the robe on in the bathroom and then come in ? Easier to just slip it off your shoulders . ”
83976	83979	83980	83980	I	5148	“ No , ”
84031	84036	84037	84037	Blaine	2099	“ Oh , man , ”
84040	84062	84063	84063	he	2099	“ That ’s great . Your profile is amazing . And you have the most beautiful breasts . Stay like that , ”
84073	84083	84066	84066	he	2099	“ I just want to find the right place . ”
84171	84179	84180	84180	Blaine	2099	“ Can you do the jeans now ? ”
84194	84197	84198	84198	Damien	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
84204	84209	84210	84210	I	5148	“ I — sure . ”
84337	84340	84341	84341	he	5148	“ Shhh , ”
84344	84377	84341	84341	he	5148	“ It ’s okay . We ’ll take it slow . It ’s hard , I know . Revealing yourself like that . It takes courage , but you can do it . ”
84452	84459	84460	84460	I	5148	“ I ca n’t do it , ”
84472	84482	84460	84460	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t . ”
84499	84530	84494	84494	I	5148	“ I thought I could . I do n’t know what I thought . That it would be revenge against you . Against the world . I do n’t know . ”
84556	84563	84564	84564	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , Damien , ”
84567	84582	84564	84564	I	5148	“ I ca n’t take your money . And I ca n’t do this . ”
84695	84711	84712	84712	I	5148	“ I — I can call a cab if you want . Or Edward can — ”
84766	84778	84751	84751	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , Damien . I ’m so sorry . ”
84794	84800	84751	84751	I	5148	“ I ’ll wait outside . ”
84811	84814	84815	84815	His	5148	“ Nikki … ”
84830	84833	84815	84815	His	5148	“ Nikki . ”
84881	84890	84876	84876	His	5148	“ Where do you think you ’re going ? ”
84891	84907	84876	84876	His	5148	“ I have to leave . I told you . I ca n’t do this . ”
84908	84914	84915	84915	he	5148	“ We have a deal , ”
84924	84931	84915	84915	he	5148	“ You ’re mine , Nikki . ”
84959	84962	84963	84963	he	5148	“ Mine , ”
84998	85005	84993	84993	I	5148	“ I ’m breaking the deal . ”
85006	85013	85035	85035	His	5148	“ I do n’t accept that . ”
85023	85034	85020	85020	my	5148	“ Fuck what you accept . I ’m saying no . ”
85044	85048	85035	85035	His	5148	“ Stop it . ”
85053	85060	85049	85049	He	5148	“ What are you afraid of ? ”
85061	85067	85070	85070	I	5148	“ I ’m not afraid . ”
85100	85103	85104	85104	He	5148	“ Bullshit . ”
85124	85148	85104	85104	He	5148	“ I can taste the fear on you , baby . Tell me . Dammit , Nikki , let me make it better . ”
85164	85188	85161	85161	he	5148	“ All right . I wo n’t hold you to our deal . But at least let me see what I ’m losing . ”
85198	85201	85189	85189	My	5148	“ What ? ”
85202	85237	85161	85161	he	5148	“ I wanted a portrait . And I wanted the woman . Naked , Nikki . Naked and open in my bed . At least let me see what I ’m missing out on . ”
85253	85260	85189	85189	My	5148	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
85274	85291	85261	85261	He	5148	“ I ’m not . Take your jeans off , Nikki . Let me see you . ”
85292	85299	85300	85300	I	5148	“ You son of a bitch . ”
85393	85401	85381	85381	he	1613	“ You goddamn son of a bitch . ”
85510	85515	85516	85516	His	5148	“ Oh , baby . ”
85525	85534	85535	85535	He	5148	“ I knew there was something , but … ”
85552	85559	85535	85535	He	5148	“ Who did this to you ? ”
85592	85616	85583	85583	I	5148	“ Is this what you were afraid of ? That I ’d learn about these scars ? That I would n’t want you ? ”
85639	85642	85643	85643	I	5148	“ Sweetheart … ”

85970	85999	86004	86004	He	5148	“ I do n’t want an icon . Not on my wall , not in my bed . I want the woman , Nikki . I want you . ”

86428	86459	86401	86401	He	5148	“ No does n’t always mean no . But the safeword always means stop . If I go too far , that ’s what you say . Do you understand ? ”
86463	86473	86460	86460	I	5148	“ What do you want your safeword to be ? ”

88562	88573	88552	88552	He	5148	“ It ’s all about the placement of the ropes . ”

89467	89475	89476	89476	He	5148	“ I was n’t sure you remembered . ”
89486	89493	89476	89476	He	5148	“ I remember everything about you . ”
89511	89519	89505	89505	he	5148	“ You did n’t remember the pageant . ”
89520	89567	89476	89476	He	5148	“ The Dallas Convention Center . You wore a fire engine red ball gown and a turquoise bathing suit . You were also about ten pounds lighter , and you were eyeing the mini - cheesecakes with the kind of lust that makes a man hard . ”
89571	89578	89568	89568	I	5148	“ Yeah , I probably was . ”
89587	89594	89579	89579	He	5148	“ The curves are an improvement . ”

89678	89682	89683	89683	I	5148	“ A lie ? ”
89693	89699	89683	89683	I	5148	“ What do you mean ? ”
89700	89725	89579	89579	He	5148	“ Exactly what I told you at the time . You did n’t want to be there . You felt like a kindred spirit . ”
89726	89748	89749	89749	I	5148	“ You were right . That was my last pageant . After that one , I finally managed to get free . ”
89752	89770	89749	89749	I	5148	“ Kindred spirit ? You said that because you wanted out of tennis , did n’t you ? ”
89775	89779	89771	89771	His	5148	“ Hell yes . ”
89863	89869	89854	89854	He	5148	“ We both got out , ”

89902	89913	89892	89892	His	5148	“ Let me show you what I want to explore . ”
89924	89928	89914	89914	I	5148	“ Too sore ? ”

89948	89957	89958	89958	He	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear it . ”
90025	90034	90035	90035	he	5148	“ I thought we ’d try something new , ”
90038	90046	90035	90035	he	5148	“ Or , rather , something old . ”
90047	90050	90035	90035	he	5148	“ Old ? ”
90051	90066	90067	90067	he	5148	“ Plain , old - fashioned missionary position . Spread your legs , baby , ”
90141	90149	90150	90150	he	5148	“ I think someone broke the rules , ”
90165	90178	90153	90153	he	5148	“ I think you lied when you said you were n’t sore . ”
90187	90198	90179	90179	I	5148	“ Maybe I did . Maybe it was worth it . ”
90199	90207	90208	90208	he	5148	“ I ’ll go nice and easy , ”
90268	90278	90279	90279	I	5148	“ There ’s something to be said for traditional , ”
90311	90320	90306	90306	Damien	5148	“ Let ’s get cleaned up and eat . ”

90557	90566	90567	90567	he	5148	“ I ’m a man of many resources , ”
90629	90634	90663	90663	he	5148	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
90635	90638	90639	90639	I	5148	“ Nothing . ”
90647	90662	90663	90663	he	5148	“ Your makeup preferences and shoe size are in the Macy ’s gift registry , ”

90773	90793	90695	90695	I	5148	“ After you agreed . It ’s remarkable how fast things can be accomplished when the price is right . ”
90794	90805	90719	90719	I	5148	“ You did n’t have to do this for me . ”
90806	90819	90820	90820	He	5148	“ I did n’t want to bring you to a construction site . ”

91916	91924	91911	91911	He	5148	“ You did n’t use a condom . ”
91932	91944	91925	91925	I	5148	“ I assumed you were clean . You are , right ? ”
91945	91949	91950	91950	he	5148	“ I am , ”
91953	91962	91950	91950	he	5148	“ But that ’s not the only issue . ”
91963	91970	91971	91971	I	5148	“ I ’m on the pill , ”
91990	91993	91994	91994	he	5148	“ Good , ”
91997	92005	91994	91994	he	5148	“ In fact , that ’s excellent . ”
92091	92094	92095	92095	he	5148	“ Come , ”
92143	92149	92150	92150	he	5148	“ Take the robe off , ”
92176	92184	92185	92185	he	5148	“ Do n’t fall asleep on me , ”
92195	92202	92185	92185	he	5148	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
92307	92312	92313	92313	he	5148	“ Open your mouth , ”
92325	92332	92333	92333	he	5148	“ You ’re beautiful , Nikki , ”
92336	92342	92333	92333	he	5148	“ Do you believe me ? ”
92343	92352	92361	92361	he	5148	“ When you say it , I do . ”
92368	92372	92361	92361	he	5148	“ How long ? ”
92380	92388	92389	92389	I	5148	“ I was sixteen when I started , ”
92392	92467	92468	92468	I	5148	“ My sister got married and moved out . And Mother kicked the pageant stuff into overdrive . It sounds petty , I know , but Ashley was the only person who kept me centered . Without her around , I got so frustrated I ’d take the crowns out of the trophy case and bend them . Not so much that Mother noticed . Just enough so that they were n’t perfect anymore . ”
92471	92483	92389	92389	I	5148	“ I guess I graduated from crowns to my own skin . ”
92484	92488	92389	92389	I	5148	“ Why cutting ? ”
92489	92569	92570	92570	I	5148	“ I do n’t really know . It ’s a compulsion ; it just felt like that was what I needed . Either cut or float off into some black hell . I felt so disconnected , like my life did n’t belong to me . The pain gave me an anchor . Now , I think it was something my mother could n’t touch . Then , I just knew it helped . It ’s hard to explain . ”
92596	92601	92602	92602	he	646	“ I get it , ”
92627	92630	92631	92631	he	646	“ Sixteen , ”
92635	92650	92631	92631	he	646	“ But when I saw you compete at eighteen , there were no scars . ”
92651	92655	92656	92656	I	5148	“ My hips , ”
92659	92683	92656	92656	I	5148	“ I kept all the cuts on my hips at first . Easy enough to hide , even in a pageant dressing room . ”
92684	92688	92689	92689	He	646	“ What changed ? ”
92700	92703	92704	92704	I	5148	“ Ashley , ”
92707	92758	92759	92759	I	5148	“ When I was eighteen , she committed suicide . Her husband had left her — my mother had been appalled . Said Ashley must have done something to drive him away . I guess Ashley thought so , too , because her suicide note said she was a failure . ”
92773	92811	92759	92759	I	5148	“ That was the first time I realized how much I hated my mother . But I still did n’t have the courage to tell her to fuck the pageants . So I sliced up my thighs . ”
92817	92826	92759	92759	I	5148	“ That ’s a lot harder to hide . ”
92827	92834	92882	92882	Damien	5148	“ Did she get you help ? ”
92835	92881	92759	92759	I	5148	“ No . First she went on and on about how I screwed up her plans and embarrassed her . Then she told me I was a selfish bitch because I was throwing away all that prize money and scholarships and probably even a husband . ”
92928	92991	92904	92904	He	5148	“ She told me I destroyed all her hard work , and she did n’t know why she ’d spent years bothering with a ridiculous little fool like me . She said I ’d ruined my body and my future . I guess part of me believed her , because even once I was in Austin at school , I still cut . ”
93006	93033	93034	93034	I	5148	“ I was scared and alone and overwhelmed . But I did see a counselor , and things started to get better and finally I stopped . ”
93039	93045	93046	93046	I	5148	“ My mother has money , ”
93049	93076	93046	93046	I	5148	“ Nothing like you have , but she inherited the family oil business when my grandfather passed away , along with a pretty hefty bank account . ”
93159	93238	93239	93239	My	5148	“ Anyway , Mother cut me off financially after I declared my majors . Science was n’t what she wanted for her little girl . But that was the best thing for me , because suddenly I did n’t have her looking over my shoulder . I did n’t have to be perfect . I did n’t quit immediately , but it started to get better , and after a while I did n’t need to cut anymore . ”
93354	93367	93345	93345	his	837	“ I understand , baby . I promise you , I understand . ”
93378	93387	93368	93368	I	5148	“ But what are n’t you telling me ? ”
93393	93402	93388	93388	I	5148	“ I — how do you know that ? ”
93403	93411	93412	93412	he	837	“ The way you ran from me , ”
93442	93451	93452	93452	My	5148	“ What if I say ‘ sunset ’ ? ”
93465	93471	93472	93472	He	837	“ If you need to . ”
93488	93496	93472	93472	He	837	“ Or you can just hold tight . ”
93512	93519	93520	93520	I	5148	“ I never slept with Ollie , ”
93523	93533	93520	93520	I	5148	“ Not the way you understood me , anyway . ”
93554	93606	93540	93540	I	5148	“ It was about a week after Ashley ’s birthday , a few years after the suicide . I ’d mostly stopped cutting , but sometimes — well , sometimes I needed it . But I was getting better . Ollie knew . And Jamie . And they were helping me . ”
93607	93611	93534	93534	He	837	“ What happened ? ”
93612	93732	93540	93540	I	5148	“ I got drunk . I mean wasted drunk . My mom had called and given me some head trip . I missed Ashley something fierce . And I was dating this guy . Kurt . We ’d been going out for months , and it had taken me a while , but we started sleeping together , and he would tell me how he did n’t mind the scars , that I was beautiful , that it was about me , not my scars or my tits or any of that stuff . Just me and him and our connection . And I believed him and , honestly , the sex was good . We had fun together . ”
93746	93787	93733	93733	I	5148	“ But this night , we both got wasted . Honestly , I do n’t even know how he managed to get an erection . But he did , and we did , and afterward he looked at my legs and he”—my
93792	93827	93733	93733	I	5148	memory—“he told me I was lucky I had a pretty face and such a sweet pussy because I was one totally screwed - up bitch , and my scars made him want to puke . ”
93871	93877	93878	93878	I	5148	“ I went to Ollie , ”
93881	93908	93878	93878	I	5148	“ He knew about my scars and he was my friend and I knew he was attracted to me . And I tried to seduce him . ”
93909	93917	93918	93918	Damien	5148	“ He would n’t sleep with you , ”
93921	93928	93929	93929	I	5148	“ He would n’t fuck me , ”
93932	94012	93929	93929	I	5148	“ But he took off my jeans and he told me that for some of those scars he remembered what I ’d been through , and he told me that he thought I was strong . That he did n’t want me cutting anymore . That I was better than my mother and I needed to forget assholes like Kurt and finish school and get the hell out of Texas . Then he held me until I fell asleep . ”
94019	94040	94013	94013	I	5148	“ I thought he got me through it . Guess I still have some issues to work through , huh ? ”
94059	94062	94063	94063	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
94094	94100	94089	94089	I	5148	“ He ’s ancient history . ”
94101	94118	94076	94076	He	5148	“ He will be if I ever meet the fucker . What ’s his last name ? ”
94136	94151	94152	94152	I	5148	“ No . It ’s all in the past . I ’m over it , ”
94164	94175	94155	94155	He	5148	“ What about the other men you ’ve slept with ? ”
94184	94215	94216	94216	I	5148	“ There have n’t been any others . Just my first when I was sixteen — some prep school idiot my mom fixed me up with . And then Kurt . ”
94219	94271	94216	94216	I	5148	“ It ’s okay , though . I mean , I dated and fooled around , but mostly I ’ve been focused on school . I have n’t been sitting in an ivory tower wondering why no one ’s unlocking my chastity belt . And I own a really nice vibrator . ”
94280	94284	94275	94275	him	5148	“ Do you ? ”
94310	94322	94323	94323	His	5148	“ Well , maybe someday you can show it to me . ”
94378	94383	94384	94384	Damien	5148	“ And after Kurt ? ”
94387	94393	94384	94384	Damien	5148	“ Did you cut anymore ? ”
94394	94410	94384	94384	Damien	5148	“ No . There were a few times I really wanted to , but no . ”
94411	94415	94384	94384	Damien	5148	“ The garage ? ”
94430	94435	94416	94416	I	5148	“ That was you ? ”
94436	94446	94384	94384	Damien	5148	“ I was worried about the way you left . ”
94447	94474	94416	94416	I	5148	“ I was scared of what you ’d think . You were … I wanted you , but you were about to see them , and — ”
94483	94494	94475	94475	He	643	“ I know , baby . Did you cut yourself ? ”
94495	94501	94502	94502	I	5148	“ I thought about it , ”
94505	94520	94521	94521	I	5148	“ I even jammed my keys into my flesh . But did I cut ? ”
94526	94533	94521	94521	I	5148	“ No . I did n’t . ”
94534	94540	94541	94541	His	643	“ And you wo n’t . ”
94560	94569	94570	94570	he	643	“ You asked if I ’ll hurt you , ”
94573	94607	94570	94570	he	643	“ There are a lot of things I do — things I want to do with you . And if there ’s pain , it ’s only to bring more pleasure . Okay ? ”
94611	94643	94608	94608	I	5148	“ I wo n’t draw blood . That ’s not my thing . But even if it was , I would n’t do it with you . Do you understand that ? ”
94696	94704	94705	94705	he	643	“ Do you still need the pain ? ”
94708	94715	94716	94716	I	5148	“ I did n’t think so , ”
94719	94735	94716	94716	I	5148	“ But then in the car — I wanted it , but I fought it . ”
94736	94746	94747	94747	His	643	“ If you need it , you tell me . ”
94754	94759	94747	94747	His	643	“ Do you understand ? ”
94859	94867	94868	94868	I	5148	“ And what about you , Damien ? ”
94872	94878	94868	94868	I	5148	“ What do you need ? ”
94952	94955	94956	94956	he	5148	“ You , ”
94969	94980	94981	94981	Blaine	2099	“ Blondie , I swear you are on fire today . ”
95003	95022	94986	94986	I	5148	“ So you think you ’re good ? We can take it slow again if you need to . ”
95023	95037	95038	95038	I	5148	“ I ’m good . Thanks . Damien told you why I freaked ? ”
95071	95148	95038	95038	I	5148	“ He did , and I ’ll tell you exactly what I told him — except for the fact that your scars mean you ’ve been hurting , I am one - hundred - percent cool with having them in the painting . Some models , especially the professional ones , it ’s like painting air - brushed people . Give me something raw any day . Honest , Nikki . I ’ll do you right . ”
95149	95154	95155	95155	I	5148	“ I believe you . ”
95194	95201	95188	95188	I	5148	“ Something like this , maybe ? ”
95202	95208	95209	95209	Damien	5148	“ I ’m not sure , ”
95229	95245	95222	95222	he	5148	“ Maybe if we set up a fan outside ? Really get the drapes billowing ? ”
95246	95259	95260	95260	I	5148	“ You ’ll need to put back the two you took down , ”
95266	95269	95270	95270	Blaine	2099	“ Huh ? ”
95277	95283	95284	95284	Damien	5148	“ What do you think ? ”
95298	95304	95284	95284	Damien	5148	“ You ’re the boss . ”
95305	95312	95284	95284	Damien	5148	“ And you ’re the artist . ”
95322	95341	95313	95313	Blaine	2099	“ That ’s a first . According to Evelyn , our benefactor does n’t take direction from anybody . ”
95342	95349	95350	95350	Damien	5148	“ I ’m not taking direction , ”
95353	95369	95350	95350	Damien	5148	“ I ’m asking your opinion . I did n’t say I would accept it . ”
95432	95435	95436	95436	I	5148	“ Boys ! ”
95448	95455	95456	95456	Blaine	2099	“ Actually , that looks good , ”
95459	95473	95456	95456	Blaine	2099	“ Stay there . I think I ’m having a moment of brilliance . ”
95491	95500	95501	95501	Blaine	2099	“ How do you feel about a reflection ? ”
95514	95525	95526	95526	He	2099	“ I swear , this is going to be amazing . ”
95551	95563	95564	95564	He	2099	“ You see ? I ’m right , are n’t I ? ”
95592	95616	95579	95579	He	2099	“ There . Her reflection on the glass , the breeze , and the woman herself facing out . It will be stunning . ”
95617	95621	95622	95622	Damien	5148	“ Her face ? ”
95625	95650	95579	95579	He	2099	“ Hidden . Probably looking down . And the reflection will be muted . Nothing graphic . Trust me . It will look exceptional . ”
95651	95656	95657	95657	Damien	5148	“ I like it , ”
95660	95663	95657	95657	Damien	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
95682	95688	95689	95689	I	5148	“ I have a say ? ”
95693	95706	95689	95689	I	5148	“ I thought you bought me lock , stock , and barrel . ”
95707	95712	95713	95713	he	2099	“ Stocks are tempting , ”
95728	95755	95723	95723	He	2099	“ Yes . I want the reflection . I want as much of her as I can get . I have n’t had enough this morning . ”
95834	95854	95829	95829	I	5148	“ By the way , is n’t it Tuesday ? Are n’t you supposed to be out of town ? ”
95895	95898	95899	95899	he	5148	“ No , ”
95902	95913	95899	95899	he	5148	“ I have no plans outside of the office today . ”
95914	95917	95920	95920	me	5148	“ Oh . ”
95954	95960	95961	95961	I	5148	“ Somebody broke a rule , ”
95964	95968	95961	95961	I	5148	“ No lying . ”
95975	95985	95969	95969	His	5148	“ I never said the rule applied to me . ”
96181	96186	96187	96187	Blaine	2099	“ Yo . Blondie ! ”
96234	96237	96238	96238	he	2099	“ Tonight , ”
96241	96269	96238	96238	he	2099	“ I have meetings all day , but I ’ll text you with the details . Edward ’s ready to take you home whenever you ’re done . ”
96270	96279	96280	96280	Blaine	2099	“ I could keep her here all day , ”
96283	96290	96280	96280	Blaine	2099	“ She ’s a fabulous subject . ”
96291	96295	96296	96296	I	5148	“ All day ? ”
96316	96322	96323	96323	Blaine	2099	“ I said I could , ”
96326	96347	96323	96323	Blaine	2099	“ I think Mr. Big Shot Businessman will fire me if I tire you out or keep you too long . ”
96348	96353	96354	96354	Damien	5148	“ I certainly will , ”
96362	96369	96357	96357	He	2099	“ I have plans for her . ”
96390	96395	96396	96396	Blaine	2099	“ There you go , ”
96399	96410	96396	96396	Blaine	2099	“ I like that color on your cheeks , Blondie . ”
96497	96506	96507	96507	he	2099	“ Evelyn ’s dying to see you again , ”
96516	96524	96507	96507	he	2099	“ She wants the gossip on Damien . ”
96539	96563	96525	96525	I	5148	“ Really ? I get the feeling she ’s the one who has all the gossip . On Damien and on everybody else . ”
96564	96576	96612	96612	He	5148	“ Sounds to me like you ’ve got my lady nailed . ”
96577	96588	96589	96589	I	5148	“ I really do need to give her a call , ”
96592	96611	96589	96589	I	5148	“ I ’ve been wanting to see her , too . Maybe we can see each other tomorrow . ”
96623	96638	96612	96612	He	5148	“ Get out of here , Blondie . You ’re messing with my concentration . ”
96639	96642	96643	96643	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
96664	96691	96655	96655	Blaine	2099	“ You ’re sure it ’s okay if I go ? I mean , how can you paint me if there ’s no me to paint ? ”
96692	96712	96713	96713	He	5148	“ It ’s amazing how much of painting from life does n’t actually require the living to be present . ”
96722	96734	96713	96713	He	5148	“ Go . Edward ’s probably bored out of his mind . ”
96735	96743	96744	96744	I	5148	“ He ’s just waiting out there ? ”
96800	96818	96833	96833	Edward	366	“ This kind of thing does n’t happen to me often . I ’m keeping a record . ”
96819	96822	96823	96823	Blaine	2099	“ Blondie , ”
96826	96832	96823	96823	Blaine	2099	“ I know the feeling . ”
96861	96869	96870	96870	he	366	“ Last week it was Tom Clancy , ”
96873	96880	96870	96870	he	366	“ This week , Stephen King . ”
96986	96992	96993	96993	I	5148	“ Thanks for the lift , ”
97000	97029	97030	97030	He	366	“ It was my pleasure . And Mr. Stark asked me to be sure you got this . He said to tell you it ’s for this evening . ”

97302	97305	97306	97306	I	5148	“ No , ”
97363	97369	97356	97356	Damien	5148	“ What kind of bite ? ”
97370	97405	97414	97414	Blaine	2099	“ They want to schedule an interview . They ’re short - staffed and they ’re busy . They ’d like to see you in the office tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it ? ”

98691	98705	98688	98688	I	5148	“ Much more of that and we wo n’t be leaving this apartment . ”
98706	98714	98715	98715	he	5148	“ Oh really ? Why is that ? ”
98752	98776	98744	98744	my	5148	“ Because your little present is making me so hot that all I can think about is you inside me fucking me hard . ”
98807	98810	98811	98811	I	5148	“ Coming ? ”
98817	98822	98823	98823	he	5148	“ Apparently not yet , ”
98921	98930	98907	98907	Damien	5148	“ Did you say something , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
98931	98936	98937	98937	I	5148	“ No . Nothing . ”
98951	98959	98937	98937	I	5148	“ So , where are we going ? ”

99007	99011	99012	99012	I	5148	“ What charity ? ”
99015	99049	99012	99012	I	5148	“ Any chance you could just write them a very big check and we can go to the house ? Or your apartment ? Or right here ? Here is good , actually . ”

99211	99219	99220	99220	he	5148	“ You glow when you ’re aroused , ”
99223	99239	99220	99220	he	5148	“ I ’ve told you that before . It ’s an incredible turn - on . ”
99240	99243	99249	99249	me	5148	“ Oh . ”
99256	99264	99265	99265	he	5148	“ Did you do this , baby ? ”
99291	99301	99302	99302	He	5148	“ Did you touch yourself before I came over ? ”
99346	99360	99334	99334	he	5148	“ Did you play with your clit ? Did you think of me ? ”
99361	99364	99365	99365	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
99377	99384	99334	99334	he	5148	“ Did you read my note ? ”

99431	99437	99334	99334	he	5148	“ What did it say ? ”
99438	99444	99445	99445	I	5148	“ Not to touch myself . ”
99479	99487	99464	99464	my	5148	“ You said that was your privilege . ”
99488	99496	99523	99523	he	5148	“ And why is it my privilege ? ”
99508	99514	99497	99497	I	5148	“ Because I ’m yours . ”
99515	99520	99523	99523	he	5148	“ That ’s right . ”
99580	99598	99576	99576	I	5148	“ You broke the rules , Ms. Fairchild . What happens to girls who break the rules ? ”
99616	99621	99599	99599	I	5148	“ They ’re punished . ”
99631	99642	99622	99622	He	5148	“ I think you better sit still , Ms. Fairchild . ”
99643	99646	99647	99647	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
99702	99708	99690	99690	I	5148	“ Do you like that ? ”
99709	99714	99690	99690	I	5148	“ Oh , yes . ”
99767	99775	99776	99776	he	5148	“ I ’m crazy about your hair , ”
99823	99829	99830	99830	I	5148	“ You ’re so cruel , ”
99833	99841	99842	99842	he	5148	“ Oh , but I ’m not , ”
99858	99889	99855	99855	he	5148	“ Tell me , Ms. Fairchild . What should your punishment be ? What should I do to a naughty girl who touches herself when she ’s not supposed to ? ”
99974	99982	99966	99966	I	5148	“ Maybe you ought to spank me . ”
99997	100002	99983	99983	His	5148	“ Jesus , Nikki . ”
100063	100067	100068	100068	I	5148	“ Go ahead , ”
100071	100075	100068	100068	I	5148	“ Punish me . ”
100114	100117	100118	100118	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
100121	100128	100118	100118	he	5148	“ Is this what you need ? ”
100163	100166	100167	100167	I	5148	“ No , ”
100170	100178	100167	100167	I	5148	“ But it is what I want . ”
100191	100202	100203	100203	he	5148	“ You ’ve been a bad girl , Ms. Fairchild , ”
100213	100221	100203	100203	he	5148	“ Yes , sir , Mr. Stark . ”
100297	100302	100303	100303	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
100357	100363	100353	100353	he	5148	“ Do you like that ? ”
100364	100367	100368	100368	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
100371	100380	100353	100353	he	5148	“ Hardly a punishment if you like it . ”
100383	100391	100353	100353	he	5148	“ But I like it , too . ”
100485	100489	100490	100490	I	5148	“ Fuck me , ”
100493	100507	100490	100490	I	5148	“ Fuck me now or do n’t ever think of fucking me again . ”
100621	100631	100632	100632	he	5148	“ Oh , God , Nikki , those pearls , ”
100697	100702	100703	100703	I	5148	“ Serves you right , ”
100786	100792	100793	100793	he	5148	“ Your lipstick is smeared , ”
100799	100806	100807	100807	I	5148	“ Gee . I wonder why ? ”
100850	100854	100855	100855	he	5148	“ Leave it , ”
100858	100870	100855	100855	he	5148	“ The way it falls on your shoulders is incredibly sexy . ”
100898	100906	100881	100881	I	5148	“ So no skipping out , huh ? ”
100907	100913	100926	100926	He	5148	“ I ’m afraid not . ”
101220	101225	101226	101226	I	5148	“ What is S.E.F. ? ”
101242	101249	101250	101250	he	5148	“ Do you want to play ? ”
101267	101275	101236	101236	he	5148	“ Sure . How does it work ? ”
101276	101295	101236	101236	he	5148	“ We buy the tokens and play for prizes . All the cash goes to the educational foundation . ”
101311	101313	101344	101344	she	651	“ S ”
101317	101322	101344	101344	she	651	“ Stark Educational Foundation ? ”
101323	101334	101335	101335	He	5148	“ You ’re a very bright woman , Ms. Fairchild . ”
101351	101360	101344	101344	she	651	“ I have a twenty in my purse . ”
101361	101386	101387	101387	He	5148	“ And I wo n’t object if you spend it . It ’s a very good cause . But we can start with these . ”
101394	101398	101387	101387	He	5148	“ Where to ? ”
101420	101426	101427	101427	Damien	5148	“ The lady feels lucky , ”
101444	101457	101427	101427	Damien	5148	“ On your arm , Mr. Stark ? I guess she is . ”
101490	101495	101496	101496	I	5148	“ I give up , ”
101507	101514	101496	101496	I	5148	“ Do you want to mingle ? ”
101515	101519	101520	101520	He	5148	“ Of course . ”
101536	101548	101496	101496	I	5148	“ I think our dealer — is she called a dealer ? ”
101549	101556	101557	101557	Damien	5148	“ In the States , yes , ”
101560	101578	101557	101557	Damien	5148	“ If we were in Paris , you could call her a croupier . What about her ? ”
101579	101592	101496	101496	I	5148	“ I think she has a bit of a crush on you . ”
101600	101611	101593	101593	He	5148	“ Does she ? And why do you think that ? ”
101612	101634	101593	101593	He	5148	“ She kept looking at you . But do n’t get any ideas . She ’s far too young for you . ”
101635	101645	101593	101593	He	5148	“ Actually , she ’s older than she looks . ”
101654	101661	101646	101646	I	5148	“ You really do know her ? ”
101662	101676	101677	101677	he	5148	“ Hell yes . She ’s one of our most successful foundation recipients , ”
101680	101717	101677	101677	he	5148	“ She grew up in a shithole of a town in Nevada with a mom who used the child - support check to buy meth . Now Debbie ’s a freshman at UCLA majoring in chemistry . ”
101718	101730	101593	101593	He	5148	“ That ’s wonderful . What exactly does the foundation do ? ”
101731	101808	101677	101677	he	5148	“ We identify kids with an aptitude for science who , for whatever reason , are n’t able to access the opportunities . Most come from families like Debbie ’s , but we have a few who are bound by their own circumstances . One young man is a quadriplegic . He thought his dream of college was over after the accident that left him paralyzed . He ’s working on his Ph.D. from MIT now . ”
101825	101829	101830	101830	I	5148	“ Excuse me , ”
101901	101923	101898	101898	he	5148	“ I see someone I ’d like to speak with . Are you okay on your own for a few minutes ? ”
101924	101933	101934	101934	I	5148	“ I think I can tough it out , ”
102153	102162	102143	102143	I	5148	“ There she is , my favorite model . ”
102163	102174	102175	102175	I	5148	“ You did n’t tell me you ’d be here . ”
102182	102202	102175	102175	I	5148	“ Is Evelyn here ? Is that why you looked so coy when I mentioned getting together with her ? ”
102203	102206	102207	102207	he	2099	“ Busted , ”
102228	102236	102237	102237	Blaine	2099	“ I see her all the time , ”
102252	102261	102247	102247	He	2099	“ All of her . You two talk . ”
102307	102320	102301	102301	Evelyn	5962	“ Hang on , Texas . I want to watch the view . ”
102346	102377	102338	102338	she	5962	“ I ’m almost sixty years old , and I ’m only just now getting the best sex of my life . I swear , the universe is n’t fair . ”
102378	102391	102392	102392	I	5148	“ Then again , maybe the universe is very good to you , ”
102399	102427	102392	102392	I	5148	“ Well , look who ’s a glass - half - full kinda gal . You ’re right , Texas . I like the way you think . ”
102449	102464	102465	102465	she	1246	“ I ’ve been hearing nothing but good things about you , young lady , ”
102468	102486	102465	102465	she	1246	“ Guess it was a rom - com , after all . Or are we talking NC-17 ? ”
102493	102497	102498	102498	I	5148	“ Could be , ”
102501	102516	102517	102517	She	1246	“ Good for you . Hell , good for you both . That boy … ”
102527	102530	102531	102531	I	5148	“ What ? ”
102559	102584	102585	102585	Her	1246	“ I saw the way he kissed you just now . Gentle , but I swear he looked like he could eat you up . ”
102598	102617	102585	102585	Her	1246	“ He ’s usually so closed off . It ’s wonderful to see him opening up to you . ”
102618	102622	102623	102623	I	5148	“ It is , ”
102693	102700	102685	102686	Social Nikki	5143	“ He ’s overcome so much , ”
102724	102734	102735	102735	She	1246	“ Now you see what I meant by inscrutable . ”
102738	102763	102735	102735	She	1246	“ It does n’t matter that so much has been swept under the carpet . These things haunt you . How could they not ? ”
102764	102768	102769	102769	I	5148	“ I know , ”
102777	102827	102735	102735	She	1246	“ See ? That ’s why I think you ’re good for him . Hell , a year ago , you ’d have to drag him to his own fund - raiser . Tonight he waltzed in here with you on his arm looking like he owns the world . ”
102828	102831	102832	102832	I	5148	“ Well , ”
102835	102841	102832	102832	I	5148	“ he pretty much does . ”
102842	102872	102832	102832	I	5148	“ True . Shit , I ’m not anywhere near drunk enough for tonight . Let ’s go find one of those skinny bitches with the trays of drinks . ”
102947	102955	102942	102942	Damien	5148	“ Everything okay with you and Ollie ? ”
102989	102998	102999	102999	he	5148	“ I think I need to taste you , ”
103032	103035	103036	103036	Damien	5148	“ Charles , ”
103054	103060	103061	103062	the man	225	“ We need to talk , ”
103070	103081	103065	103065	He	225	“ Charles Maynard . I ’m terribly sorry to intrude . ”
103082	103091	103099	103099	I	5148	“ Oh , no . It ’s okay . ”
103119	103131	103113	103113	Ollie	837	“ Hey . I ’ve been wanting to talk to you . ”
103132	103140	103141	103141	I	5148	“ I ’ve been here all night . ”
103168	103178	103157	103157	Ollie	837	“ I know . But I wanted you alone . ”
103179	103184	103185	103185	I	5148	“ What is it ? ”
103210	103234	103157	103157	Ollie	837	“ I just wanted to say I ’m sorry . About what happened with Jamie , I mean . It was stupid and — ”
103241	103260	103235	103235	I	5148	“ You guys are both adults . But you ’re also my friends . And you ’re engaged . ”
103272	103300	103261	103261	I	5148	“ I do n’t want you to screw up a good thing . And I really , really do n’t want to get caught in the middle . ”
103301	103308	103309	103309	he	5148	“ I know . I know , ”
103312	103328	103309	103309	he	5148	“ It was a one - time thing . Stupid , but it ’s over . ”
103357	103363	103349	103349	I	5148	“ What did Damien want ? ”
103364	103369	103370	103370	He	5148	“ Oh , that . ”
103382	103403	103370	103370	He	5148	“ He thanked me . For , you know . Being there for you . After that stuff with Kurt . ”
103410	103418	103404	103404	I	5148	“ It meant a lot to me . ”
103428	103449	103419	103419	He	5148	“ Do n’t you thank me , too . You know there ’s nothing I would n’t do for you . ”
103464	103473	103474	103474	I	5148	“ He ’s a good guy , Ollie , ”
103477	103485	103474	103474	I	5148	“ Are you starting to see that ? ”
103486	103489	103490	103490	he	5148	“ Sure , ”
103502	103505	103506	103506	I	5148	“ What ? ”
103509	103535	103506	103506	I	5148	“ What is it about Damien Stark that bugs you so much ? Is it all the shit Sara Padgett ’s brother is stirring up ? ”
103550	103598	103536	103536	He	5148	“ Oh , hell , Nik . Stark ’s a celebrity . He ’s not up on billboards , but that ’s what he is , and there are always shitstorms around celebrities . Eric Padgett ’s just the latest guy tossing wads to see what sticks . ”
103604	103618	103599	103599	I	5148	“ And that ’s it ? That ’s all that ’s bugging you ? ”
103633	103658	103619	103619	Ollie	837	“ Yeah . Yeah , that ’s it . Listen , I see a client . I ’m going to catch her , okay ? ”
103664	103674	103659	103659	I	5148	“ Wait . What are n’t you telling me ? ”
103675	103678	103705	103705	He	837	“ Nothing . ”
103679	103694	103659	103659	I	5148	“ Jesus , Ollie , this is me . What are n’t you saying ? ”
103695	103704	103705	103705	He	837	“ I — oh , hell , fine . ”
103725	103751	103705	103705	He	837	“ Honestly , I was n’t even sure if I was going to say anything to you . I mean , maybe it ’s nothing . ”
103761	103772	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ I mean , he seems like an okay guy . ”
103773	103781	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ He is . Now tell me . ”
103785	103818	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ You need to keep this to yourself , okay ? It ’s attorney - client stuff . Privileged . I could get fired . Hell , I could lose my license . ”
103825	103828	103819	103819	I	5148	“ Okay . ”
103829	103852	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ Well , I have n’t worked directly for Stark , but I hear things . Whispers . Impressions . You know . ”
103853	103856	103857	103857	I	5148	“ No , ”
103860	103865	103857	103857	I	5148	“ I do n’t . ”
103866	103902	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ Oh , hell , Nikki . I ’ve just heard enough folks talk about the guy that I was worried about you . So when I had the chance , I did some snooping . ”
103903	103911	103857	103857	I	5148	“ Snooping ? What does that mean ? ”
103912	103935	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ Jamie told me what he said to you at Evelyn ’s party . About you turning down MIT and Cal Tech . ”
103936	103939	103857	103857	I	5148	“ So ? ”
103940	103971	103782	103782	Ollie	837	“ So why would he know that ? Those opportunities came in when you were done with college . It ’s not like you put that on a fellowship application . ”
103980	103984	103975	103975	He	5148	“ Go on . ”
103985	104045	103857	103857	I	5148	“ The Stark files are in a locked filing room a few floors up . Access is incredibly tight . But Maynard needed something fast — not for Stark , but for another client with files in the same locked room — and he sent me up to get it . I sort of took advantage of the opportunity . ”
104046	104052	103975	103975	He	5148	“ What did you do ? ”
104053	104075	103857	103857	I	5148	“ The firm administers the fellowship , so the applicant files are there . I found yours and took a peek . ”
104076	104079	103975	103975	He	5148	“ And ? ”
104080	104092	103857	103857	I	5148	“ And there was no mention of MIT or Cal Tech . ”
104096	104131	104093	104093	I	5148	“ It was incredibly sweet of you to jeopardize your career because you ’re worried about me , but I could have told you that . I keep copies of all my fellowship applications . ”
104132	104144	103975	103975	He	5148	“ But you would n’t know that your file was flagged . ”
104145	104148	104093	104093	I	5148	“ Flagged ? ”
104152	104162	104149	104149	He	5148	“ The only one . I checked them all . ”
104163	104169	104149	104149	He	5148	“ What does that mean ? ”
104175	104190	104170	104170	He	5148	“ I do n’t know . But for some reason you were singled out . ”
104196	104320	104191	104191	I	5148	“ Oh , come on , Ollie . I ’m sorry you do n’t like Damien , but you ca n’t be serious . So there ’s a flag on my file . Big deal . Maybe it ’s because I ’m allergic to penicillin . Or because I ’m the most photogenic fellowship recipient and they were going to do some sort of publicity thing . Or because I ’m the only one who moved to LA and I got added to some local mailing list . Hell , you do n’t even know that it was Stark who flagged my file . Maybe it was your boss . Or some legal assistant who has a thing for the former Miss DFW . ”
104326	104372	104321	104321	His	1736	“ I know , I know . I told you I was n’t sure it was worth mentioning . But do n’t you think it ’s weird ? Your file is not only flagged , but he knows all sorts of personal shit about you ? ”
104378	104404	104373	104373	I	5148	“ Personal shit ? Like where I was accepted to grad school is a state secret ? Come on , Ollie . Get a grip . ”
104443	104449	104450	104450	Ollie	837	“ Just think about it , ”
104463	104466	104453	104453	He	837	“ Promise ? ”
104710	104716	104717	104717	I	5148	“ Watch it , bub , ”
104724	104728	104717	104717	I	5148	“ Hiding out ? ”
104729	104735	104717	104717	I	5148	“ Yup . And thinking . ”
104736	104740	104717	104717	I	5148	“ What about ? ”
104741	104744	104745	104745	I	5148	“ You , ”
104754	104761	104748	104748	I	5148	“ I was imagining you playing . ”
104775	104784	104785	104785	he	5148	“ I presume you were imagining me winning , ”
104792	104795	104789	104789	I	5148	“ Always . ”
104796	104800	104801	104801	He	5148	“ Good girl . ”
104871	104879	104865	104865	He	5148	“ See you inside , Ms. Fairchild . ”
104885	104895	104880	104880	I	5148	“ You just came out here to tease me ? ”
104896	104924	104865	104865	He	5148	“ I came to tell you I ’m giving a speech in about fifteen minutes . If you ’re inclined to , come in and join me . ”
104925	104935	104936	104936	I	5148	“ A speech ? I would n’t miss that . ”
104951	104972	104936	104936	I	5148	“ I ’ll be right behind you . I want to stay here with the stars a little bit longer . ”
105070	105078	105065	105065	his	1745	“ You the one Stark ’s banging ? ”
105089	105093	105079	105079	I	5148	“ Excuse me ? ”
105094	105126	105065	105065	his	1745	“ You got money ? Be careful . He ’ll fuck you and he ’ll use you , and when he tosses you away , he ’ll be richer for it . ”
105195	105203	105204	105204	I	5148	“ I — I have to go . ”
105212	105220	105221	105222	the man	225	“ I know that bastard ’s secrets , ”
105227	105249	105221	105222	the man	225	“ I know about all the goddamn bodies . You think my sister ’s the only one he ’s fucked up ? ”
105600	105612	105592	105592	I	5148	“ Hey ! Hey ! Is anyone out there ? Hello ! ”
105625	105628	105588	105588	he	1751	“ Nikki ? ”
105629	105632	105588	105588	he	1751	“ Damien ? ”
105633	105644	105588	105588	he	1751	“ Oh , shit , baby , are you okay ? ”
105658	105663	105664	105664	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
105667	105679	105588	105588	he	1751	“ The door wo n’t open . Can you unbolt it ? ”
105680	105687	105690	105690	I	5148	“ No . It ’s stuck . ”
105778	105789	105790	105790	he	1751	“ You do n’t have a thing to apologize for , ”
105793	105808	105765	105765	He	1751	“ I ’m so glad you came back . Why did you come back ? ”
105818	105832	105809	105809	He	1751	“ I thought you might want to play a bit before my speech . ”
105848	105853	105854	105854	I	5148	“ It was Padgett , ”
105857	105860	105865	105865	his	1751	“ What ? ”
105868	105884	105885	105885	I	5148	“ He did n’t say his name , but I ’m sure I ’m right . ”
105924	105931	105908	105908	He	1751	“ He did n’t hurt you ? ”
105932	105935	105936	105936	I	5148	“ No , ”
105951	105973	105936	105936	I	5148	“ No , he did n’t even threaten . But he scared me anyway , and that ’s why I ran . ”
105974	106004	105936	105936	I	5148	“ If you see him again — I do n’t care if he ’s three blocks away and you ’re not quite sure — you tell me . Okay ? ”
106008	106014	106005	106005	I	5148	“ Yes . Of course . ”
106020	106040	106015	106015	He	1751	“ Come on . I ’m going to make my speech , and then I ’m taking you home . ”
106256	106266	106267	106267	Blaine	2099	“ It ’s a crime you look so hot , ”
106270	106276	106267	106267	Blaine	2099	“ I feel like hell . ”
106277	106287	106288	106288	I	5148	“ That would be all the wine you had , ”
106291	106301	106302	106302	he	2099	“ Actually , that would be all the vodka , ”
106305	106344	106302	106302	he	2099	“ Why the devil I told you to be here at eight , I really do not know . Oh , wait . Yes , I do . Because the morning light on your skin makes you glow . ”
106481	106484	106468	106468	Blaine	2099	“ Problem ? ”
106485	106502	106503	106503	Damien	5148	“ I ’m going to go for a bike ride before I go to the office , ”
106551	106570	106571	106571	I	5148	“ Depending on how long you ride , I may have left by the time you get back , ”
106574	106582	106571	106571	I	5148	“ Today ’s my interview , remember ? ”
106583	106587	106588	106588	Damien	5148	“ Of course , ”
106596	106600	106601	106601	Blaine	2099	“ Go ahead , ”
106607	106620	106621	106621	He	5148	“ Say goodbye properly . I ’ll go make coffee or something . ”
106632	106638	106639	106639	I	5148	“ I really like him , ”
106642	106645	106646	106646	Damien	5148	“ Mmm , ”
106757	106768	106769	106769	Damien	5148	“ I ’m jealous of the way he touches you , ”
106786	106793	106780	106780	I	5148	“ Blaine ’s never touched me . ”
106794	106797	106798	106798	Damien	5148	“ No , ”
106801	106810	106811	106811	He	5148	“ But he ’s bringing you to life . ”
106825	106831	106832	106832	he	5148	“ That ’s my job , ”
106835	106845	106846	106846	He	5148	“ And you do it very , very well . ”
106851	106867	106846	106846	He	5148	“ We can send Blaine out for doughnuts and I ’ll forget the bike ride . ”
106868	106874	106875	106875	I	5148	“ No way , dude . ”
106883	106924	106875	106875	I	5148	“ I ’m on a schedule today , remember . I need time to get dressed , read some of the research on the company . All those girl - looking - for - gainful - employment kinds of things . ”
106925	106939	106846	106846	He	5148	“ I ’ll hire you right now . Gainful - employment conundrum solved . ”
106940	106948	106875	106875	I	5148	“ No . A million times no . ”
106949	106960	106961	106961	He	5148	“ Ca n’t blame a guy for trying . Go . ”
106972	106982	106961	106961	He	5148	“ I ’ll see you on the flip side . ”
106983	106986	106987	106987	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
106990	106994	106987	106987	I	5148	“ You will . ”
107547	107556	107557	107557	she	1788	“ So what should we do to celebrate ? ”
107560	107564	107557	107557	she	1788	“ A movie ? ”
107565	107581	107557	107557	she	1788	“ No way . I want the dirt on you and Mr. Moneybags . Sushi ? ”
107582	107585	107557	107557	she	1788	“ Perfect . ”
107670	107675	107676	107676	I	5148	“ You almost ready ? ”
107681	107685	107686	107686	she	1788	“ Five minutes , ”
107691	107701	107686	107686	she	1788	“ Hey , did you see today ’s paper ? ”
107702	107705	107686	107686	she	1788	“ Why ? ”
107706	107724	107686	107686	she	1788	“ It ’s on the coffee table . The Life and Style section . Check it out . ”
108028	108031	108032	108032	I	5148	“ James , ”
108050	108062	108043	108043	I	5148	“ I ’ve got to go . Sorry about the sushi . ”
108086	108091	108083	108083	her	1796	“ What ? What ? ”
108150	108153	108154	108154	I	5148	“ Fine , ”
108157	108182	108154	108154	I	5148	“ I ’m going to wait for him in the penthouse . Tell him Ms. Fairchild wants to see him the minute he returns . ”
108762	108765	108766	108766	I	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
108855	108864	108846	108846	I	5148	“ Is everything okay ? What ’s happened ? ”
108865	108875	108840	108840	I	5148	“ Why did n’t you tell me about Bruce ? ”
108888	108896	108880	108880	He	5148	“ What should I have told you ? ”
108897	108917	108846	108846	I	5148	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? Shit , Damien , you ’re the reason I got the offer . ”
108918	108932	108933	108933	he	5148	“ I pulled strings so that Bruce knew you were in the market , ”
108937	108973	108933	108933	he	5148	“ But that ’s it . You got it because you ’re damn good at what you do . Because your credentials are stellar . Because you ’re smart and hardworking and you deserve it . ”
108991	109013	108974	108974	I	5148	“ And how exactly do you know all that about me ? From watching me pose naked ? From fucking me ? ”
109014	109021	108846	108846	I	5148	“ I see you , Nikki . ”
109022	109041	108974	108974	I	5148	“ Yeah , well , maybe that ’s because you ’ve been looking for such a long time . ”
109046	109053	109042	109042	His	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
109054	109109	108846	108846	I	5148	“ At Evelyn ’s party , for one . You were so pissed at me for being Carl ’s assistant . You gave a better rundown of my credentials than I could . How did you know so much about me ? It was n’t in my fellowship file . So how , Damien ? ”
109110	109131	109042	109042	His	5148	“ I ’ve followed your academic career . I ’ve talked with your professors . I ’ve watched you blossom . ”
109132	109135	109136	109136	He	1810	“ I — ”
109154	109158	109136	109136	He	1810	“ But why ? ”
109163	109168	109169	109169	I	5148	“ Damien , why ? ”
109177	109183	109184	109184	he	1810	“ Because I want you , ”
109212	109223	109204	109204	I	5148	“ I have since I met you at the pageant . ”
109229	109240	109224	109224	My	5148	“ But — but why not say something back then ? ”
109248	109264	109241	109241	His	1810	“ I can be a very patient man when the goal is worth waiting for . ”
109265	109268	109269	109269	I	5148	“ I — ”
109306	109310	109301	109301	I	5148	“ Why me ? ”
109319	109354	109314	109314	his	1810	“ I told you that , too . We ’re kindred spirits . And you ’re strong , Nikki . There ’s a core of strength and confidence in you that ’s damn sexy . ”
109375	109383	109384	109384	I	5148	“ Have you not noticed the scars ? ”
109387	109397	109384	109384	I	5148	“ I ’m not strong , I ’m weak . ”
109429	109432	109433	109433	He	1810	“ Weak ? ”
109446	109489	109433	109433	He	1810	“ The hell you are . You ’re not weak , Nikki . You ’re powerful . You ’re a survivor . When I hold you , I can feel the power in you . It ’s like holding a live wire . ”
109503	109529	109490	109490	He	1810	“ That ’s why I want you , baby . I ’m not weak , either . Why would I want a woman who is ? ”
109580	109594	109595	109595	I	5148	“ You know so much about me , and I hardly know you , ”
109598	109614	109595	109595	I	5148	“ Do you know this is the first time I ’ve even seen your bedroom ? ”
109615	109623	109573	109573	Nikki	5143	“ There ’s not much to see . ”
109624	109631	109632	109632	I	5148	“ That ’s not the point . ”
109652	109664	109632	109632	I	5148	“ Nikki , I need to know that we ’re okay . ”
109699	109704	109705	109705	I	5148	“ Will you try ? ”
109708	109716	109705	109705	I	5148	“ Try to share more with me ? ”
109717	109731	109732	109732	he	1810	“ I ’ve shared more with you than I have with any woman , ”
109751	109771	109772	109772	I	5148	“ I know . I just — I just really want to know you . Does that make sense ? ”
109803	109821	109796	109796	I	5148	“ Unlike some people , I do n’t have the resources to find out on my own . ”
109822	109829	109830	109830	he	1810	“ I thought you had Wikipedia , ”
109882	109890	109891	109891	he	1810	“ It ’s not easy for me , ”
109902	109918	109891	109891	he	1810	“ I ’ve never wanted to share the bits and pieces of my life before . ”
109919	109926	109927	109927	My	5148	“ Do you want to now ? ”
109955	109958	109946	109946	He	1810	“ Yes . ”

109979	109984	109985	109985	he	1810	“ I ’ll try , ”
110000	110005	109988	109988	He	1810	“ Come with me . ”
110074	110077	110078	110078	His	1810	“ Nikki . ”
110122	110125	110126	110126	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
110129	110141	110126	110126	I	5148	“ Why does everything fall away when I ’m with you ? ”
110142	110149	110150	110150	he	1810	“ Because there ’s nothing else , ”
110153	110160	110150	110150	he	1810	“ Nothing but you and me . ”
110228	110231	110232	110232	I	5148	“ Please , ”
110280	110285	110274	110274	Damien	5148	“ Please fuck me . ”
110286	110293	110294	110294	His	1810	“ Oh , God , Nikki . ”
110331	110336	110341	110341	he	1810	“ Spread your legs . ”
110489	110496	110497	110497	he	5148	“ That ’s it , baby , ”
110584	110588	110589	110589	Damien	5148	“ Look outside , ”
110592	110598	110589	110589	Damien	5148	“ What do you see ? ”
110599	110604	110605	110605	I	5148	“ It ’s sunset , ”
110638	110653	110621	110621	He	5148	“ Never , baby . Between us , the sun is never going down . ”
110654	110657	110658	110658	I	5148	“ No , ”
110666	110669	110658	110658	I	5148	“ Never . ”
110718	110723	110724	110724	she	79	“ What the hell ? ”
110732	110740	110724	110724	she	79	“ You just vanished into thin air . ”
110741	110745	110746	110746	I	5148	“ I know , ”
110749	110770	110746	110746	I	5148	“ I ’m a terrible roommate , but I ’ll make it up to you . Breakfast . My treat . ”
110771	110779	110724	110724	she	79	“ And you ’ll tell me everything ? ”
110780	110783	110784	110784	I	5148	“ Swear , ”
110845	110886	110825	110825	she	79	“ Ollie ’s like an overprotective brother . And Damien ’s just too damn hot to stay mad at . Besides , it ’s not like he told Bruce to hire you . He just told Bruce about your resume . ”
110887	110890	110891	110891	I	5148	“ Exactly , ”
110922	110932	110933	110933	I	5148	“ This is my last week among the unemployed , ”
110936	110942	110933	110933	I	5148	“ Wanna catch a movie ? ”
111022	111026	111027	111027	I	5148	“ Hang on , ”
111061	111065	111066	111066	he	366	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
111086	111114	111071	111071	he	366	“ Mr. Stark asked me to deliver a personal apology that he was n’t able to spend the day with you in celebration of your new job . ”
111115	111119	111120	111120	I	5148	“ He did ? ”
111152	111166	111167	111167	Edward	366	“ And may I extend my congratulations on your new job as well ? ”
111170	111174	111175	111175	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
111178	111200	111175	111175	I	5148	“ But he really did n’t need to send you . He already congratulated me when I saw him last night . ”
111201	111222	111167	111167	Edward	366	“ Yes , but I ’m to deliver your gift . Or , rather , deliver you to your gift . ”
111230	111237	111223	111223	I	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
111238	111255	111316	111316	She	1830	“ I ’m afraid I have very specific instructions that forbid me from actually telling you . ”
111256	111270	111223	111223	I	5148	“ Oh . Um , okay . Let me just tell my roommate . ”
111271	111282	111316	111316	She	1830	“ Ms. Archer is invited as well , of course . ”
111283	111286	111223	111223	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
111300	111315	111292	111292	I	5148	“ Hey , James . Change of plans . We ’re going … somewhere . ”
111345	111353	111335	111335	She	1830	“ Huh ? Where are we going ? ”
111354	111369	111316	111316	She	1830	“ Edward wo n’t say . But it ’s a present . From Damien . ”
111370	111378	111335	111335	She	1830	“ And I ’m invited , too ? ”
111379	111382	111383	111383	Edward	366	“ Absolutely , ”
111386	111396	111397	111397	she	1830	“ How fab is that ? Well , shit , ”
111402	111428	111397	111397	she	1830	“ I ’m not turning down a mystery present from a guy with billions . That ’s just not something I ’m programmed to do . ”
111429	111439	111440	111440	I	5148	“ Fair enough . I guess we ’re going , ”
111522	111525	111526	111526	she	1830	“ Wine ? ”
111604	111613	111614	111614	I	5148	“ Where do you think we ’re going ? ”
111634	111638	111645	111645	she	1830	“ Who cares ? ”
111681	111686	111677	111677	Madonna	406	“ Like a Virgin . ”
111687	111692	111693	111693	Jamie	1450	“ So totally retro , ”
111944	111948	111949	111949	she	1850	“ Holy shit , ”
111952	111961	111949	111949	she	1850	“ We ’re at the Desert Ranch Spa . ”
111962	111965	111966	111966	I	5148	“ Seriously ? ”
112008	112015	112016	112016	Jamie	1450	“ Are we staying the night ? ”
112019	112049	112016	112016	Jamie	1450	“ Or maybe we ’re just here for dinner ? God , I hope we ’re staying the night . I ’ve never stayed in a place like this . ”
112109	112121	112122	112122	she	1855	“ Ms. Fairchild , Ms. Archer . Welcome to Desert Ranch , ”
112135	112150	112122	112122	she	1855	“ I ’m Helena . Come . I ’ll take you to your bungalow . ”
112202	112207	112208	112208	she	1855	“ For the record , ”
112227	112237	112208	112208	she	1855	“ I am totally in love with your boyfriend . ”
112303	112322	112339	112339	Helena	408	“ You will have dinner in your room , yes ? And then tomorrow we begin at eight . ”
112334	112338	112330	112330	I	5148	“ Begin what ? ”
112342	112345	112339	112339	Helena	408	“ Everything . ”
112907	112918	112919	112919	I	5148	“ Just my back and arms and calves , please , ”
112922	112927	112919	112919	I	5148	“ Not my thighs . ”
112928	112932	112933	112933	She	1878	“ Of course . ”
113475	113478	113479	113479	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
113521	113540	113503	113503	his	5148	“ I ca n’t begin to tell you how happy I am that you knew it was me . ”
113614	113618	113619	113619	Jamie	1450	“ You know , ”
113623	113643	113619	113619	Jamie	1450	“ nothing personal , but I do n’t think I got the same level of service that she did . ”
113652	113655	113656	113656	he	1886	“ Come , ”
113665	113671	113672	113672	she	1878	“ That ’s the problem , ”
113680	113685	113672	113672	she	1878	“ I did n’t . ”
113803	113809	113810	113810	I	5148	“ What are we doing ? ”
113823	113826	113827	113827	he	5148	“ Celebrating , ”
113891	113904	113905	113905	he	5148	“ I thought you might like to take her for a spin , ”
113913	113916	113905	113905	he	5148	“ Seriously ? ”
113920	113923	113924	113924	I	5148	“ Seriously ? ”
113949	113954	113933	113933	He	5148	“ Just start slow . ”
113960	113972	113955	113955	His	5148	“ But it ’s no fun if you keep it slow . ”
113993	113998	113982	113982	I	5148	“ Is she new ? ”
113999	114004	114029	114029	He	5148	“ No , why ? ”
114005	114028	113982	113982	I	5148	“ New - car smell . Um , she ’s not like some rare classic car that ’s irreplaceable , is she ? ”
114040	114045	114029	114029	He	5148	“ Drive , Nikki . ”
114046	114051	114052	114052	I	5148	“ Drive . Right . ”
114110	114119	114120	114120	Damien	5148	“ Go left when you hit the street , ”
114123	114145	114120	114120	Damien	5148	“ There are no other homes or businesses past the resort . I doubt there will be any traffic at all . ”
114215	114222	114206	114206	I	5148	“ You ’re sure about this ? ”
114223	114227	114228	114228	he	5148	“ Hell yes , ”
114231	114239	114206	114206	I	5148	“ What if I strip the gears ? ”
114240	114264	114206	114206	I	5148	“ I hope you do . I think a striptease would be an appropriate apology for something like that , do n’t you ? ”
114284	114291	114292	114292	I	5148	“ Do n’t talk like that , ”
114295	114301	114292	114292	I	5148	“ I need to concentrate . ”
114316	114327	114328	114328	he	5148	“ All that power in the palm of your hand , ”
114344	114350	114351	114351	I	5148	“ Boys and their toys , ”
114363	114367	114368	114368	I	5148	“ Here goes , ”
114514	114519	114520	114520	I	5148	“ That was amazing , ”
114523	114529	114520	114520	I	5148	“ Totally , completely amazing . ”
114545	114567	114520	114520	I	5148	“ Am I trembling ? God , I think my body ’s still vibrating just from the speed of this car . ”
114568	114574	114575	114575	he	5148	“ Boys and their toys ? ”
114581	114593	114575	114575	he	5148	“ I think this qualifies as a girl toy , too . ”
114594	114601	114602	114602	I	5148	“ Heck yeah , it does . ”
114663	114670	114671	114671	he	5148	“ I do n’t think so , ”
114674	114685	114671	114671	he	5148	“ I think I ’m going to make you wait . ”
114756	114761	114762	114762	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
114765	114773	114762	114762	he	5148	“ tell me you liked our toy . ”
114774	114779	114762	114762	he	5148	“ Oh , yes . ”
114780	114787	114762	114762	he	5148	“ I have a new game . ”
114788	114791	114762	114762	he	5148	“ Game ? ”
114796	114809	114792	114792	He	5148	“ I bet I can make you come without even touching you . ”
114810	114830	114831	114831	I	5148	“ Let me drive this car a bit longer , and you wo n’t have to do a thing , ”
114837	114854	114834	114834	He	5148	“ I do n’t want to make myself redundant . Besides , I brought another toy . ”
114899	114903	114904	114904	I	5148	“ All right , ”
114907	114912	114904	114904	I	5148	“ I ’m curious . ”
114933	114938	114913	114913	He	5148	“ What is that ? ”
114939	114945	114946	114946	he	5148	“ I ’ll show you , ”
114979	114984	114956	114956	he	5148	“ What the hell ? ”
114988	114993	114985	114985	He	5148	“ You ’ll see . ”
114994	114997	114985	114985	He	5148	“ But — ”
114998	115004	114985	114985	He	5148	“ How does it feel ? ”
115005	115015	115016	115016	I	5148	“ I — it ’s , um , interesting . ”
115029	115032	115033	115033	he	5148	“ Interesting ? ”
115064	115068	115069	115069	I	5148	“ Holy fuck , ”
115087	115091	115092	115092	he	5148	“ Remote control , ”
115223	115232	115233	115233	he	5148	“ There ’s a restaurant here I love , ”
115297	115302	115303	115303	I	5148	“ I like it , ”
115306	115317	115303	115303	I	5148	“ The ambience is great , the food even better . ”
115357	115365	115366	115366	he	5148	“ I want to look at you , ”
115403	115415	115399	115399	I	5148	“ Do n’t you dare . This is a nice restaurant . ”
115525	115536	115537	115537	I	5148	“ You ’re very easy to read , Ms. Fairchild . ”
115594	115603	115604	115604	I	5148	“ You ’re torturing me , you know , ”
115621	115630	115607	115607	Damien	5148	“ Hey , I ’m not doing anything . ”
115631	115634	115607	115607	Damien	5148	“ Hmmm . ”
115635	115644	115645	115645	he	5148	“ Anticipation is the better part of pleasure , ”
115648	115655	115656	115656	I	5148	“ Anticipation is driving me crazy , ”
115674	115689	115659	115659	He	5148	“ Tell me about the job . What does Bruce have planned for you ? ”
115695	115702	115690	115690	I	5148	“ You really do n’t know ? ”
115706	115712	115703	115703	He	5148	“ I really do n’t . ”
115732	115738	115739	115739	I	5148	“ Bruce seems really cool , ”
115742	115753	115739	115739	I	5148	“ I think I ’ll learn a lot from him . ”
115754	115792	115703	115703	He	5148	“ I ’m sure you will , but I still do n’t understand why you do n’t just dive in and work for yourself . You said you have a product in mind to develop , right ? ”
115793	115797	115798	115798	I	5148	“ I do , ”
115801	115839	115840	115840	I	5148	“ Honestly , I think I ’m a little scared . I spent five years in school learning all the technical stuff . I trust myself with the science and the engineering . But the business end … ”
115847	115870	115840	115840	I	5148	“ I feel like there should have been a class on how to find investors or how to raise capital or something . ”
115887	115917	115880	115880	I	5148	“ I just do n’t want to jump in before I feel competent . I ’m afraid if I do all your money will just slip through my fingers . ”
115918	115924	115925	115925	he	5148	“ It ’s your money , ”
115928	115958	115959	115959	he	5148	“ Or it will be soon . But if you need help , all you have to do is ask . I ’ve gotten pretty good at this stuff , ”
115965	115994	115880	115880	I	5148	“ Damien , please . I just — I just feel like I need to be the one who does this . On my own , you know ? ”
115995	116007	115880	115880	I	5148	“ No one survives in business going entirely on their own . ”
116008	116011	115880	115880	I	5148	“ Damien … ”
116012	116015	116016	116016	he	5148	“ Fine , ”
116019	116080	116016	116016	he	5148	“ But let me give you some advice . If you ’re looking to make a splash in the tech field , the time is now . I do n’t know what ideas you ’re developing , but I promise that you are n’t the only one . Screw around too long , and someone will hit the market first . ”
116081	116088	116111	116111	I	5148	“ Like what happened to Carl . ”
116089	116092	116093	116093	He	5148	“ Exactly . ”
116098	116110	116093	116093	He	5148	“ Will you tell me your idea ? I ’m curious . ”
116156	116198	116207	116207	I	5148	“ I have several smartphone apps already out there , and they ’ll be part of the company , of course . But the marquee product will be a cross - platform note - sharing system for use on the Web . ”
116199	116206	116222	116222	users	1922	“ I ’m intrigued . Explain . ”
116244	116268	116207	116207	I	5148	“ That ’s just the most obvious use . There are all sorts of permutations . But I think it has real potential . ”
116269	116274	116275	116275	he	5148	“ So do I , ”
116278	116288	116275	116275	he	5148	“ When you ’re ready , I ’ll help . ”
116324	116353	116315	116315	I	5148	“ How about you ? How was your trip to San Diego ? Did you buy a conglomerate ? A country ? A chain of gourmet cupcake bakeries ? ”
116449	116458	116444	116444	he	5148	“ I was there to visit my father . ”
116525	116535	116536	116536	I	5148	“ How long has he lived in San Diego ? ”
116557	116568	116569	116569	he	5148	“ I bought him the house when I was fourteen , ”
116579	116593	116572	116572	He	5148	“ That was the year I fired him and hired a new manager . ”
116594	116597	116598	116598	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
116626	116648	116623	116623	Damien	5148	“ It was nice of you to visit him . I ’m guessing you two do n’t have the best relationship . ”
116655	116662	116649	116649	He	5148	“ Why do you say that ? ”
116672	116698	116663	116663	I	5148	“ Him taking such tight control of your career . Making you play even when you wanted to quit and go to the science academy . ”
116699	116702	116703	116703	He	5148	“ Right . ”
116730	116741	116663	116663	I	5148	“ It was nice of you to go see him . ”
116742	116747	116748	116748	I	5148	“ An unpleasant necessity . ”
116787	116792	116793	116793	I	5148	“ It was amazing , ”
116805	116815	116793	116793	I	5148	“ I ’ve never had a mud bath before . ”
116816	116824	116831	116831	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry I missed it . ”
116825	116830	116831	116831	I	5148	“ Me , too , ”
116884	116892	116839	116839	his	5148	“ Did Jamie have a good time ? ”
116893	116930	116839	116839	his	5148	“ Are you kidding ? She thinks you ’re the world ’s greatest humanitarian now . Seriously , it was wonderful of you to invite her . She ’s been having a tough time of it . ”
116931	116935	116839	116839	his	5148	“ How so ? ”
116936	116942	116943	116943	I	5148	“ She ’s an actress , ”
116956	116963	116839	116839	his	5148	“ Has she gotten any work ? ”
116964	117054	116839	116839	his	5148	“ A few local commercials and some equity waiver stuff . But considering she ’s been here for years , she ’s not exactly making progress . She ’s frustrated . I think her agent ’s getting frustrated . And I know finances are a concern . She ’s not , you know , walking the streets in patent leather , but I think she may have actually slept with a few guys just because she knew they ’d feed her well or cover her mortgage for the month . ”
117055	117063	116839	116839	his	5148	“ And now you ’re living there . ”
117064	117084	117085	117085	I	5148	“ Well , that takes the pressure off , sure . But still . She has to find work . ”
117096	117122	117085	117085	I	5148	“ What ’s so frustrating is that she ’s genuinely talented , and the camera loves her . If she could just get that break … ”
117130	117148	117085	117085	I	5148	“ Sorry . I ’m rambling . But I love her and I feel bad for her . ”
117149	117156	117179	117179	his	5148	“ You want to help her . ”
117157	117160	117085	117085	I	5148	“ Yeah . ”
117169	117175	117164	117164	his	5148	“ I know the feeling . ”
117322	117345	117316	117316	Damien	5148	“ You ’re glowing again , Ms. Fairchild . Is that for the crème brûlée ? Or could there be another reason ? ”
117346	117367	117316	117316	Damien	5148	“ You ’re a cruel man , Mr. Stark . And I think it ’s time we get the check . ”
117430	117435	117436	117436	he	5148	“ What is it ? ”
117439	117443	117444	117444	I	5148	“ Just this . ”
117465	117470	117471	117471	I	5148	“ Turn it on , ”
117474	117479	117480	117480	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
117511	117523	117506	117506	I	5148	“ God , Nikki , let ’s get to the car . ”
117524	117527	117528	117528	I	5148	“ No , ”
117552	117557	117544	117544	his	5148	“ Now . Please . ”
117570	117573	117574	117574	I	5148	“ Now , ”
117577	117590	117574	117574	I	5148	“ Leave the thing on . And do n’t take it out . ”
117624	117627	117628	117628	I	5148	“ Please , ”
117631	117644	117628	117628	I	5148	“ Please , Damien . Fuck anticipation . I want you now . ”
117712	117716	117717	117717	he	5148	“ Holy hell , ”
117724	117731	117717	117717	he	5148	“ That was quite a trip . ”
117732	117738	117717	117717	he	5148	“ Got your vibe on ? ”
117739	117746	117717	117717	he	5148	“ You ’re quite the minx . ”
117747	117752	117753	117753	I	5148	“ I guess so , ”
117756	117771	117753	117753	I	5148	“ I seem to remember someone saying he does n’t have sex in public . ”
117772	117778	117779	117779	he	5148	“ That ’s my rule , ”
117782	117800	117779	117779	he	5148	“ Anyone who works so very hard to make me break it deserves an equally inventive punishment . ”
117830	117847	117801	117801	I	5148	“ Come on , Ms. Fairchild . I think it ’s time to get you home . ”
117968	117976	117956	117956	I	5148	“ Are you going to come in ? ”
118004	118015	118001	118001	his	5148	“ Oh , I ’m coming in , all right . ”
118380	118386	118392	118392	his	5148	“ Take off your skirt . ”
118458	118463	118449	118449	Damien	5148	“ Now the shirt . ”
118550	118561	118542	118542	I	5148	“ Kick off your shoes , then spread your legs . ”
118661	118667	118668	118668	he	5148	“ Do you want more ? ”
118678	118681	118692	118692	he	5148	“ Yes . ”
118704	118715	118716	118716	He	5148	“ Go to your room and get on the bed . ”
118731	118752	118728	118728	he	5148	“ No touching . I need your promise , Nikki . And this time I need you to keep it . ”
118756	118759	118753	118753	I	5148	“ Okay . ”
118771	118779	118784	118784	him	5148	“ I mean , yes , sir . ”
119115	119122	119123	119123	he	5148	“ I like looking at you , ”
119126	119134	119135	119135	I	5148	“ I like you touching me better . ”
119147	119153	119140	119140	He	5148	“ That was n’t nice . ”
119157	119164	119154	119154	He	5148	“ Sweetheart , that was nothing . ”
119297	119305	119306	119306	Damien	5148	“ A cat - o’-nine - tails , ”
119310	119317	119318	119318	I	5148	“ Um , uh - huh . ”
119533	119550	119503	119503	he	5148	“ You ’ve been very naughty . I do n’t think I should make you come . ”
119551	119561	119562	119562	I	5148	“ I really think you ’re wrong about that , ”
119572	119589	119503	119503	he	5148	“ Close your eyes . Can you keep them closed , or should I blindfold you ? ”
119590	119597	119503	119503	he	5148	“ I ’ll keep them closed . ”
119598	119604	119503	119503	he	5148	“ Is that a promise ? ”
119605	119608	119609	119609	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
119670	119676	119677	119677	he	5148	“ Keep your legs spread , ”
119680	119701	119677	119677	he	5148	“ Yes , like that . Oh , baby , you ’re so beautiful . Beautiful and open for me . ”
119812	119818	119819	119819	His	5148	“ Did you like that ? ”
119882	119885	119886	119886	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
119889	119894	119886	119886	I	5148	“ I liked it . ”
119895	119911	119962	119962	His	243	“ I told you there might be pain , but only to bring you pleasure . ”
119912	119922	119886	119886	I	5148	“ I remember . I — I want more . ”
119923	119941	119962	119962	His	243	“ Nikki , oh , fuck , Nikki . Do you know what you do to me ? ”
119942	119961	119886	119886	I	5148	“ If it ’s anything like what you do to me , I think I have some idea . ”
120018	120021	120009	120009	his	243	and—“Oh!”—tight and hard .
120027	120030	120031	120031	he	243	“ No , ”
120085	120092	120093	120093	he	243	“ Your nipples are so sensitive , ”
120105	120110	120111	120111	he	243	“ Oh , yes , ”
120114	120130	120111	120111	he	243	“ This time I do n’t think I have to ask if you like it . ”
120218	120221	120222	120222	His	243	“ Damien . ”
120280	120286	120260	120260	He	243	“ Keep your eyes closed . ”
120424	120427	120428	120428	I	5148	“ Again , ”
120431	120436	120428	120428	I	5148	“ Damien , please . ”
120524	120527	120528	120528	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
120771	120784	120764	120764	I	5148	“ I think I ’m going to like being a bad girl . ”
120788	120794	120785	120785	He	243	“ I know you are . ”
120842	120858	120834	120834	He	243	“ A lovely thought , but I need to make a run to the office . ”
120859	120873	120834	120834	He	243	“ How do you do that ? How do you read my mind ? ”
120907	120919	120834	120834	He	243	“ You really need to go ? It ’s so late . ”
120920	120949	120834	120834	He	243	“ I ca n’t stay much longer . I have a conference call scheduled with Tokyo . Unfortunately , I have files in my office that I need . ”
120950	120961	120834	120834	He	243	“ I ’ll see you in the morning , then . ”
120967	121009	120962	120962	He	5148	“ Blaine ’s still in La Jolla . He wants to switch your sitting to tomorrow evening . Why do n’t you come by around five . I ’ll take off early and we can have a drink before he arrives . ”
121010	121018	121019	121019	I	5148	“ What if I ’m not thirsty ? ”
121023	121037	121038	121038	He	5148	“ I ’m sure we can find something to satisfy both our appetites . ”
121044	121054	121038	121038	He	5148	“ Come on . Let ’s get cleaned up . ”
121129	121133	121134	121134	he	5148	“ Keep them , ”
121137	121151	121134	121134	he	5148	“ Someday , I may tell you to wear them under your clothes . ”
121194	121197	121198	121198	he	5148	“ Well , ”
121210	121216	121217	121217	I	5148	“ I love that picture , ”
121220	121226	121217	121217	I	5148	“ You look so happy . ”
121239	121245	121227	121227	He	5148	“ I feel very exposed . ”
121249	121263	121246	121246	I	5148	“ Really ? More than how I feel standing naked for a portrait ? ”
121268	121282	121246	121246	I	5148	“ Once again , you ’ve made a good point , Ms. Fairchild . ”
121283	121286	121287	121287	I	5148	“ Here , ”
121327	121332	121365	121365	He	5148	“ What are you — ”
121333	121336	121337	121337	I	5148	“ Hush , ”
121340	121344	121337	121337	I	5148	“ Say cheese . ”
121345	121348	121350	121350	he	5148	“ Nikki — ”
121378	121381	121382	121382	I	5148	“ No , ”
121391	121429	121382	121382	I	5148	“ I ’m not deleting it , I ’m not erasing it , I ’m not ignoring it . I want a picture of the two of us together , and you can just deal with it . ”
121465	121469	121470	121470	he	5148	“ All right , ”
121477	121485	121473	121473	he	5148	“ I want a copy , too . ”
122457	122462	122463	122463	He	5148	“ You ’re early . ”
122510	122521	122522	122522	He	5148	“ How could I resist an extra minute with you ? ”
122528	122536	122522	122522	He	5148	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
122557	122564	122537	122537	He	5148	“ Damien ? What ’s wrong ? ”
122565	122570	122571	122571	he	5148	“ Lawyers and assholes , ”
122579	122590	122571	122571	he	5148	“ Sorry . It ’s been one of those days . ”
122591	122596	122571	122571	he	5148	“ Should I go ? ”
122597	122600	122601	122601	He	5148	“ Never . ”
122627	122630	122631	122631	He	5148	“ Nikki . ”
122668	122675	122676	122676	he	5148	“ I ’ve been expecting that , ”
122691	122696	122697	122697	he	5148	“ Is it done ? ”
122700	122800	122697	122697	he	5148	“ Good . Yes , I understand that , but I also understand that I pay you for advice . The ultimate decisions are mine . Yes , I do . Twelve - point - six ? Fuck it , I would have paid more , and you goddamn well know it . I ’m damn sure it was the right call ; she ’s not getting dragged into this mess . No — no , it ’s done . I ’m not interested in reevaluating the decision . I made my play , we ’re running with it . ”
122809	122834	122836	122836	he	5148	“ Shit , Charles , that is n’t what I want to hear . Well , then why the fuck do I pay you ? ”
122872	122911	122836	122836	he	5148	“ Right , right . Did your PI locate the man I ’m interested in ? Oh , really ? Well , that ’s a bit of good news . I ’ll deal with it first thing tomorrow . ”
122947	122984	122985	122985	He	5148	“ What about London ? She ’s settled again ? No , it ca n’t be helped . I ’ll fly over next week . What ? Well , she ’s not leaving me much choice . ”
122990	123020	122985	122985	He	5148	“ And the San Diego problem ? I want someone on that . What ? Are you fucking kidding me ? Shit , how did they dig that up ? ”
123152	123155	123156	123156	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
123161	123166	123156	123156	I	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
123207	123210	123167	123167	He	5148	“ Damien ? ”
123211	123214	123215	123215	he	5148	“ No , ”
123218	123233	123215	123215	he	5148	“ I ’m not okay . Are you — oh , God , Nikki . ”
123234	123244	123245	123245	He	5148	“ Me ? I ’m fine . I ’m — ”
123512	123515	123516	123516	His	5148	“ Shit . ”
123821	123824	123825	123825	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
123828	123832	123825	123825	I	5148	“ You okay ? ”
123871	123876	123877	123877	I	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
123915	123922	123905	123905	I	5148	“ This might sting a little . ”
123923	123928	123929	123929	He	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki . ”
123975	123980	123973	123973	ICU	414	“ Are you okay ? ”
123981	123985	123986	123986	I	5148	“ Of course . ”
123999	124009	123986	123986	I	5148	“ You ’re the one I ’m worried about . ”
124010	124015	124021	124021	his	5148	“ I hurt you . ”
124033	124036	124037	124037	I	5148	“ No , ”
124040	124056	124037	124037	I	5148	“ You did n’t . You needed me . I want you to need me . ”
124070	124084	124057	124057	I	5148	“ And I think we ’ve established I can handle a little pain . ”
124099	124104	124105	124105	he	5148	“ Not like that , ”
124108	124112	124092	124092	he	5148	“ Why not ? ”
124113	124127	124092	124092	he	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki , I told you I ’d never hurt you . ”
124140	124151	124128	124128	I	5148	“ You spanked me . Hell , you whipped me . ”
124152	124183	124191	124191	he	5148	“ That turned you on . It was a game . And I did it because I was hot for you and because you got off on it , too . ”
124197	124205	124206	124206	He	5148	“ But what I did just now — ”
124222	124245	124206	124206	He	5148	“ Goddammit . I was pissed off about something and I fucked you in anger , and I do n’t do that . ”
124259	124299	124246	124246	I	5148	“ Damien , I ’m okay . I do n’t know what all of that was about , but I do know that you were upset . You came to me . I wanted you to come to me . ”
124300	124305	124206	124206	He	5148	“ I used you . ”
124306	124309	124310	124310	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
124317	124343	124310	124310	I	5148	“ And I do n’t care . God , Damien , you ’re not some stranger off the street . You ’re the man I — ”
124351	124411	124310	124310	I	5148	“ You ’re the man who ’s heard all of my secrets . Who ’s been in my bed and in my head . That ’s what makes it different . Do n’t you see that ? You can have me however you need me . You can tell me your secrets and it wo n’t change a thing . ”
124417	124425	124412	124412	He	1988	“ Wo n’t it ? I wonder . ”
124449	124461	124462	124462	he	1988	“ I ’m going to call Edward to take you home , ”
124471	124474	124466	124466	I	5148	“ No . ”
124475	124480	124462	124462	he	1988	“ Dammit , Nikki . ”
124481	124486	124487	124487	I	5148	“ I said no . ”
124493	124500	124487	124487	I	5148	“ You did n’t hurt me . ”
124514	124541	124507	124507	I	5148	“ I was wet for you , and you damn well know it . So there ’s no way you can say that you forced me . ”
124578	124581	124582	124582	he	1988	“ No , ”
124603	124611	124612	124612	I	5148	“ No does n’t always mean no , ”
124649	124652	124631	124631	His	1988	“ Nikki … ”
124653	124663	124664	124664	I	5148	“ I ’m going to take care of you . ”
124699	124702	124703	124703	I	5148	“ Sunset , ”
124706	124715	124703	124703	I	5148	“ It can be your safeword , too . ”
124863	124869	124855	124855	he	1988	“ Shhh . No talking . ”
125022	125028	125029	125029	he	1988	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
125042	125049	125029	125029	he	1988	“ And I ’m so angry . ”
125050	125054	125029	125029	he	1988	“ At me ? ”
125055	125061	125029	125029	he	1988	“ No . At me . ”
125062	125078	125029	125029	he	1988	“ But why ? I thought we already established that what happened upstairs was okay . ”
125090	125109	125079	125079	He	1988	“ Because now that I have you , I ca n’t stand the thought of ever losing you . ”
125350	125356	125357	125357	he	1997	“ Can you do lunch ? ”
125360	125389	125357	125357	he	1997	“ Early , because I have a one o’clock meeting . Like maybe eleven ? You could come here ? I ’ll have my secretary order us sandwiches . ”
125390	125400	125357	125357	he	1997	“ Um , sure . Why the sudden urge ? ”
125401	125417	125357	125357	he	1997	“ I just want to see you . Does there have to be a reason ? ”
125570	125573	125574	125574	he	1997	“ Hey , ”
125588	125598	125574	125574	he	1997	“ Please tell me those are n’t for me . ”
125611	125633	125602	125602	he	1997	“ No , no . These are for my meeting . Sorry . It ’s been a crazy couple of days . ”
125634	125641	125642	125642	I	5148	“ So what ’s going on ? ”
125703	125712	125713	125713	he	1997	“ You ’re not going to like it , ”
125726	125761	125716	125716	I	5148	“ Shit , Ollie . Is this about Damien again ? Can you please quit playing the role of big brother ? I ’m all grown up . I can take care of myself . ”
125783	125790	125776	125776	he	1997	“ Do you remember Kurt Claymore ? ”
125814	125817	125818	125818	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
125822	125829	125818	125818	I	5148	“ I have a vague recollection . ”
125830	125850	125802	125802	he	2005	“ He ’s been working the past five years as a manager at a Houston - based manufacturing company . ”
125851	125854	125818	125818	I	5148	“ So ? ”
125855	125866	125802	125802	he	2005	“ So your friend Damien had him fired this morning . ”
125867	125870	125871	125871	I	5148	“ What ? ”
125885	125892	125871	125871	I	5148	“ You ca n’t be sure . ”
125893	125896	125897	125897	Ollie	837	“ Yeah , ”
125900	125939	125897	125897	Ollie	837	“ I can . I said I never worked for Stark directly , but I do the work for Maynard . I ’m the one who hired the investigator to find Kurt . I ’m sorry , Nik . ”
125979	126009	126014	126014	I	5148	“ He ’s rich and arrogant and as far as he ’s concerned he owns the world and it damn well better behave the way he wants it to . ”
126010	126013	126014	126014	I	5148	“ No , ”
126027	126047	126023	126023	I	5148	“ Damien ’s not like that . He was protecting me . That was his way of protecting me . ”
126048	126059	126014	126014	I	5148	“ Protecting you ? The way he protected Sara Padgett ? ”
126065	126072	126060	126060	My	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
126073	126083	126023	126023	I	5148	“ You know who Eric Padgett is , right ? ”
126100	126103	126104	126104	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
126107	126121	126104	126104	I	5148	“ You know I do . He ’s the dead girl ’s brother . ”
126122	126222	126094	126094	he	2006	“ He keeps threatening to go to the press and say that Stark killed his sister . For weeks we ’ve had all of Stark ’s resources aimed at stopping this one asshole , and he just keeps pushing back saying he wants his money , and he ’s going to screw Stark , and there ’s more dirt out there than just his sister , but it all sounds like the same old smear routine . Just like I told you in Beverly Hills — we figured Eric Padgett was just one more asshole looking for a payday . ”
126223	126228	126229	126229	My	5148	“ What ’s happened ? ”
126261	126272	126273	126273	Ollie	837	“ Stark paid him off yesterday . That ’s right , ”
126282	126344	126273	126273	Ollie	837	“ The same Damien Stark who wanted a balls - to - the - wall defense against the guy did a complete 180 and paid the fucker off . Forget fighting . Forget all his talk about not backing down , about taking it all the way as far as it would go . He just caved . Quickly and completely . ”
126345	126349	126350	126350	I	5148	“ Caved how ? ”
126363	126377	126273	126273	Ollie	837	“ Caved to the tune of twelve - point - six million dollars . ”
126378	126383	126384	126384	I	5148	“ Oh , God . ”
126459	126464	126465	126465	I	5148	“ Oh , God , ”
126482	126535	126477	126477	he	837	“ Maybe Stark just got tired of the bullshit . But I do n’t think so . I think he ’s covering up what he did . He ’s dangerous , Nik , just like I ’ve been saying . He ’s dangerous , and you damn well know it , too . ”
126645	126650	126651	126651	Blaine	2099	“ Hey , Blondie , ”
126664	126675	126651	126651	Blaine	2099	“ I did n’t think you ’d still be here . ”
126676	126691	126692	126692	He	2099	“ Been doing some color studies . Trying to get the damn sky right . ”
126697	126709	126692	126692	He	2099	“ Getting close , but I ’m not quite there yet . ”
126726	126733	126711	126711	he	2099	“ Okay , what ’s wrong ? ”
126821	126824	126814	126814	Damien	5148	“ Nikki . ”
126843	126849	126837	126837	he	5148	“ What ’s going on ? ”
126850	126858	126859	126859	Blaine	2099	“ I ’m going to cut out , ”
126910	126921	126902	126902	I	5148	“ Did you control her the way you do me ? ”
126948	126952	126953	126953	I	5148	“ Sara Padgett , ”
126956	126969	126953	126953	I	5148	“ Goddammit , Damien , do you think I do n’t know ? ”
126970	126979	126980	126980	His	2099	“ What is it you think you know ? ”
126988	127015	127016	127016	I	5148	“ I know you need to be in control . Your life . Your business . Your women . Your bed . I even get it , ”
127055	127077	127047	127047	me	5148	“ You were abused , were n’t you ? And now you need it . You need to be in control . ”
127100	127124	127127	127127	he	2099	“ I do like to be in control , Nikki . I do n’t think I ’ve ever made a secret of that . ”
127140	127148	127149	127149	I	5148	“ Did it start as a game ? ”
127152	127161	127149	127149	I	5148	“ Did you tie her up , too ? ”
127177	127203	127149	127149	I	5148	“ Did you put this oh so gently around her arms ? Then around her throat ? Did you tell her about pleasure and pain ? ”
127219	127228	127149	127149	I	5148	“ Was it — was it an accident ? ”
127251	127259	127229	127229	His	2099	“ I did not kill Sara Padgett . ”
127270	127287	127260	127260	I	5148	“ I ’ve got twelve - point - six million reasons to believe that you did . ”
127318	127328	127288	127288	His	2099	“ How the hell did you hear about that ? ”
127348	127354	127355	127355	I	5148	“ Certainly not from you , ”
127358	127393	127355	127355	I	5148	“ I guess that ’s not the kind of thing you were going to try to be more open with me about , huh ? Well , I suppose I ca n’t blame you . ”
127394	127397	127398	127398	he	2099	“ How ? ”
127401	127410	127411	127411	I	5148	“ I overheard some of your phone conversation , ”
127428	127431	127420	127420	He	2099	“ Nikki — ”
127438	127441	127442	127442	I	5148	“ No , ”
127876	127887	127863	127863	I	5148	“ All right ! I ’m coming ! Hang on ! ”
128027	128030	128031	128031	I	5148	“ Mother , ”
128034	128041	128031	128031	I	5148	“ What are you doing here ? ”
128162	128169	128158	128158	I	5148	“ Why are you in LA ? ”
128170	128178	128179	128179	she	646	“ I would think that was obvious , ”
128182	128188	128179	128179	she	646	“ I came to help . ”
128208	128213	128214	128214	she	646	“ With Damien Stark , ”
128223	128232	128214	128214	she	646	“ What are you talking about , Mother ? ”
128233	128283	128214	128214	she	646	“ I saw the picture , of course . And the caption . Why you did n’t tell me a man like Damien Stark was courting you , I do n’t know . But it ’s the first good news I ’ve heard about this move to Los Angeles . ”
128290	128328	128214	128214	she	646	“ Well , darling , really . If you ’re trying to marry a man like Damien Stark , you want to make sure not to disappoint . He can so easily move on to another woman . ”
128356	128367	128368	128368	She	646	“ Clearly we have a lot of work to do . ”
128378	128445	128368	128368	She	646	“ What ’s the best spa nearby ? We ’ll focus on your makeup first . Thank goodness your hair is still stunning , even if it is filthy . We ’ll get the ends trimmed , of course . Then a new wardrobe and then this apartment . If Jamie is particularly attached to any of these things , she can put them in storage . ”
128446	128455	128461	128462	my mother	646	“ I broke up with him , Mother . ”
128466	128470	128472	128472	her	646	“ You what ? ”
128494	128505	128484	128484	I	5148	“ Why on earth would you do something so foolish ? ”
128506	128509	128510	128510	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
128521	128538	128510	128510	I	5148	“ Because he has some truly fucked - up control issues . Does that sound familiar ? ”
128572	128577	128578	128578	she	5167	“ You little fool , ”
128585	128608	128578	128578	she	5167	“ You always were too smart for your own good . Only Nichole knew best . Only Nichole knew what to do . ”
128609	128628	128578	128578	she	5167	“ For Nichole , yeah , Mother , that ’s right . Only Nichole knows what Nichole wants . ”
128646	128719	128635	128635	I	5148	“ You are spoiled and ungrateful . I ca n’t believe I took time out of my schedule to fly out here and see you . I am going to go back to my hotel , and you think about your life . About what you want and where you ’re going and what you ’re throwing away . And when you can talk calmly and rationally , I ’ll come back . ”
129182	129185	129186	129186	he	5148	“ Hey , ”
129224	129232	129233	129233	he	5148	“ It could use some cleaning up , ”
129237	129246	129233	129233	he	5148	“ But I think it looks cute short . ”
129247	129258	129207	129207	He	5148	“ Why are you here ? How did you know ? ”
129259	129262	129263	129263	he	5148	“ Jamie , ”
129266	129293	129263	129263	he	5148	“ I ’ve been calling her for days , checking on you . I thought you needed space . But then this , with your mother … ”
129329	129335	129336	129336	I	5148	“ She ’s still here , ”
129339	129346	129336	129336	I	5148	“ In town , I mean . ”
129347	129350	129351	129351	he	5148	“ No , ”
129354	129359	129351	129351	he	5148	“ She ’s not . ”
129365	129390	129393	129393	his	5148	“ I went to her hotel . I told her she needed to leave . And then I sent her home on the jet . ”
129396	129430	129393	129393	his	5148	“ Grayson ’s been dying to take her out for a long flight , so this was just the ticket . And your mother seemed thrilled by the prospect of a private jet . ”
129439	129443	129431	129431	I	5148	“ Thank you . ”
129444	129455	129477	129477	He	5148	“ Whatever you need , baby . I told you . ”
129461	129476	129456	129456	I	5148	“ No . Damien , I ’m sorry . I — we ca n’t . ”
129495	129500	129482	129482	I	5148	“ Because of Sara ? ”
129508	129513	129514	129514	he	5148	“ Oh , hell , ”
129542	129551	129528	129528	He	5148	“ Do you really believe I killed her ? ”
129552	129555	129528	129528	He	5148	“ No . ”
129576	129588	129573	129573	my	5148	“ Damien , I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . ”
129589	129592	129593	129593	He	5148	“ Shhh . ”
129599	129690	129593	129593	He	5148	“ It ’s okay . You ’re right . I did n’t kill her . I was n’t even there that night . I was in San Diego . Charles finally got images from the hotel ’s security camera . I was in the bar most of the night talking with the owner of a company I was interested in acquiring . That ’s why he was so pissed that I settled . We had what we needed to shut Eric down , and I went and paid him off . ”
129696	129708	129691	129691	I	5148	“ I do n’t understand , either . Why would you — ”
129709	129804	129573	129573	my	5148	“ Two reasons . Maybe I was n’t there , but dammit , I should have shut it down with Sara long before it got out of control . I wanted her interest in the company , and I got it . I bought out some other shareholders , too , which gave me a controlling interest . I edged Eric out and I put people in place who could get the company running again . Turned a tidy profit quite quickly and the value of everyone ’s stock increased , Eric ’s included . ”
129816	129933	129934	129934	He	2040	“ And during all of this I was seeing Sara . I do n’t usually date , and I did n’t love her . But I was busy and she was convenient and more than willing to indulge me in bed . She clung to me and though I did n’t admit it to myself at the time , I started to see signs that she was unbalanced . I knew I needed to break it off , but I was focused on some time - sensitive mergers , and I just let it ride . After the deal was complete , I did end it . But that just pushed her off the deep end . ”
129942	129974	129934	129934	He	2040	“ I never expected her to kill herself — and I would never choke a woman in bed — but that does n’t change the fact that I played a role . ”
129975	129983	129984	129984	I	5148	“ But it was n’t your fault , ”
129987	130003	129984	129984	I	5148	“ And Eric ’s making horrible accusations . Why would you pay that bastard off ? ”
130004	130009	129934	129934	He	2040	“ Because of you . ”
130015	130018	130010	130010	I	5148	“ What ? ”
130019	130070	129984	129984	I	5148	“ I was willing to fight him until the end of time if I had to . But that was before he approached you at the fund - raiser . I ’m not letting him drag you into this , and I ’m damn sure not letting him scare you . ”
130103	130114	130091	130091	Damien	5148	“ I — but , Damien . Twelve million dollars ? ”
130115	130160	130176	130176	He	5148	“ It ’s the current value of the stock I acquired from Sara , plus the value of Eric ’s stock . I bought him out . A damn good deal , too . The company ’s strong . I ’ll make it back . ”
130161	130175	130091	130091	Damien	5148	“ You did n’t have to . I can fight my own battles . ”
130207	130211	130212	130212	he	5148	“ You can , ”
130216	130226	130212	130212	he	5148	“ But this was n’t your battle to fight . ”
130232	130243	130227	130227	He	5148	“ Nikki , baby , I ca n’t lose you . ”
130259	130267	130255	130255	I	5148	“ There ’s other stuff , Damien . ”
130268	130272	130273	130273	he	5148	“ I know , ”
130283	130287	130255	130255	I	5148	“ You know ? ”
130288	130298	130255	130255	I	5148	“ Jamie told me . Apparently Ollie told her . ”
130299	130302	130255	130255	I	5148	“ Ollie ? ”
130313	130360	130308	130308	his	5148	“ Do n’t worry . I wo n’t say anything to Charles . Whatever confidences he betrayed , he did it for you . The bastard may have pissed me off , but I understand why he did it . I would have done the same . ”
130361	130367	130368	130368	I	5148	“ You had Kurt fired , ”
130371	130378	130368	130368	I	5148	“ Hell yes , I did . ”
130379	130391	130308	130308	his	5148	“ Damien , you ca n’t just do that to people . ”
130392	130406	130368	130368	I	5148	“ Actually , I can . He worked for one of my companies . ”
130407	130410	130411	130411	I	5148	“ But — ”
130459	130462	130463	130463	He	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
130555	130567	130544	130544	I	5148	“ You ’re wrong about what you said . About me . ”
130568	130574	130550	130550	he	5148	“ What did I say ? ”
130575	130583	130584	130584	I	5148	“ You said I was n’t weak . ”
130592	130596	130584	130584	I	5148	“ I am . ”
130597	130605	130606	130606	I	5148	“ Oh , baby , come here . ”
130635	130665	130619	130619	I	5148	“ Everyone breaks a little sometimes . That does n’t make you weak . It makes you wounded . And I will always be there to help you heal . ”
130703	130706	130707	130707	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
130710	130717	130707	130707	he	5148	“ Baby , are we okay ? ”
130784	130792	130793	130793	I	5148	“ I want to make this work , ”
130812	130817	130818	130818	I	5148	“ Is Jamie here ? ”
130842	130845	130846	130846	He	5148	“ No . ”
130858	130861	130851	130851	I	5148	“ What ? ”
130862	130877	130846	130846	He	5148	“ This may not be the best time , but I have a confession . ”
130885	130899	130878	130878	I	5148	“ Jamie ’s going to be getting a call from her agent soon . ”
130900	130907	130851	130851	I	5148	“ And you know this how ? ”
130908	130928	130929	130929	He	5148	“ Because it ’s for a series of national commercials . For a company I have an interest in . ”
130945	130952	130851	130851	I	5148	“ You did that for her ? ”
130953	130978	130979	130979	My	5148	“ For the company , actually . The ad agency presented us with three possible actresses and Jamie was the best of the bunch . ”
130994	131011	130987	130987	Damien	5148	“ Why is that okay , but helping you get the job at Innovative was n’t ? ”
131022	131028	131029	131029	I	5148	“ Because it just is , ”
131048	131051	131035	131035	He	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
131052	131055	131035	131035	He	5148	“ Yes ? ”
131056	131059	131060	131060	He	5148	“ I — ”
131100	131108	131109	131109	he	5148	“ Do n’t ever leave me again , ”
131112	131115	131116	131116	I	5148	“ No , ”
131119	131128	131116	131116	I	5148	“ How could I ? I ’m yours . ”
131148	131158	131133	131133	he	5148	“ You said I have to be in control . ”
131159	131169	131170	131170	He	5148	“ Not really an astounding revelation , is it ? ”
131173	131181	131170	131170	He	5148	“ I ’m giving it to you . ”
131182	131186	131133	131133	he	5148	“ Giving what ? ”
131187	131205	131170	131170	He	5148	“ Control , Nikki . Tell me what you want . Tell me exactly what you want . ”
131206	131213	131133	131133	he	5148	“ You mean other than you ? ”
131214	131263	131170	131170	He	5148	“ Where do you want me to touch you ? How slow ? Shall I graze my teeth over your nipple ? Shall I bite your ear ? Shall I dip my tongue into your sweet cunt ? Tell me , Nikki . Tell me what you want . ”
131264	131267	131268	131268	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
131276	131283	131268	131268	I	5148	“ But start by kissing me . ”
131348	131353	131354	131354	I	5148	“ Stroke my breasts , ”
131357	131363	131354	131354	I	5148	“ Then pinch my nipples . ”
131389	131392	131393	131393	I	5148	“ Tighter , ”
131409	131413	131414	131414	I	5148	“ Kiss me , ”
131417	131443	131414	131414	I	5148	“ All the way down until you get to my clit . I want your tongue there , and I want your fingers inside me . ”
131450	131455	131456	131456	he	5148	“ Yes , ma’am , ”
131589	131594	131595	131595	I	5148	“ Take me here , ”
131611	131616	131598	131598	I	5148	“ Are you sure ? ”
131617	131625	131626	131626	I	5148	“ I want to belong to you , ”
131629	131636	131626	131626	I	5148	“ I want to belong completely . ”
131637	131642	131643	131643	He	5148	“ Oh , baby . ”
131686	131696	131683	131683	I	5148	“ Tell me if you want me to stop . ”
131697	131706	131711	131711	His	5148	“ No . No , it feels good . ”
131721	131726	131683	131683	I	5148	“ Have you ever ? ”
131727	131730	131731	131731	I	5148	“ No , ”
131734	131738	131731	131731	I	5148	“ Only you . ”
131747	131754	131739	131739	I	5148	“ Do you have any lube ? ”
131755	131760	131761	131761	I	5148	“ In the drawer , ”
131809	131816	131817	131817	he	5148	“ We ’ll take it slow , ”
131863	131866	131833	131833	His	5148	“ Okay ? ”
131867	131875	131876	131876	I	5148	“ Yes , please do n’t stop . ”
131906	131909	131910	131910	I	5148	“ More , ”
131913	131921	131910	131910	I	5148	“ I ’m ready , but slowly . ”
131949	131952	131953	131953	he	5148	“ Sweetheart , ”
131956	131961	131964	131964	he	5148	“ Oh , baby . ”
131980	131983	131984	131984	he	5148	“ Easy , ”
131987	132001	132002	132002	He	5148	“ Slow and easy . God , Nikki , you feel so good . ”
132042	132047	132048	132048	I	5148	“ Touch my clit , ”
132117	132124	132125	132125	he	5148	“ I ’m close , Nikki , ”
132128	132137	132125	132125	he	5148	“ Baby , I ’m going to come . ”
132190	132195	132196	132196	he	5148	“ You ’re mine , ”
132199	132203	132204	132204	I	5148	“ I know , ”
132347	132352	132353	132353	I	5148	“ Ladies ’ room , ”
132356	132363	132353	132353	I	5148	“ I wo n’t be long . ”
132390	132405	132371	132371	he	5148	“ Hurry . I want to go home . I have plans for you . ”
132406	132411	132412	132412	I	5148	“ Get the check , ”
132415	132422	132371	132371	he	5148	“ Are you finished with dessert ? ”
132432	132441	132423	132423	I	5148	“ Finished ? I have n’t even started . ”
132498	132524	132481	132481	My	5148	“ Well , if it is n’t Nikki Fairchild . Hello , princess . You still fucking Damien Stark ? Guess what ? So am I. ”
132539	132546	132525	132525	I	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
132547	132550	132551	132551	he	5148	“ Skeletons , ”
132554	132562	132551	132551	he	5148	“ The kind that live in closets . ”
132563	132572	132574	132574	I	5148	“ I do n’t know what you mean . ”
132579	132605	132525	132525	I	5148	“ I ’m just thinking about how high and mighty our Mr. Stark is . You land pretty hard when you fall from the stratosphere . ”
132606	132617	132636	132636	He	5148	“ Dammit , Carl , what are you telling me ? ”
132618	132635	132525	132525	I	5148	“ You ? Not a goddamn thing . But tell loverboy I ’ll be in touch . ”
132670	132681	132682	132682	I	5148	“ Do you know what he ’s going on about ? ”
132698	132701	132702	132702	he	5148	“ No , ”
132756	132766	132767	132767	he	5148	“ Probably some shit to do with my father , ”
132770	132792	132767	132767	he	5148	“ Do n’t worry about it . I do n’t want either my father or Carl Rosenfeld to ruin our evening . ”
132948	132958	132959	132959	I	5148	“ You ’re mine , too , you know , ”
133398	133402	133403	133403	I	5148	“ Almost done ? ”
133406	133418	133403	133403	I	5148	“ The sun ’s been down for at least five minutes . ”
133459	133478	133445	133445	I	5148	“ In my mind , you ’re still bathed in light . Now stand still and be quiet . ”
133479	133483	133484	133484	I	5148	“ No problem , ”
133620	133630	133617	133617	his	2099	“ Perfect . Shit , Nikki , you look perfect ”
133923	133928	133929	133929	Damien	5148	“ The offer stands . ”
133965	134073	133942	133942	He	5148	“ Tell them to take a good long look at their P and Ls . There is n’t going to be any profit , and by the end of the year , there wo n’t even be a company . They ’re in free fall , and when they crash and burn , every one of their employees will be out of work , the company dead , the patents tied up in litigation for years as creditors fight about the assets . They take this deal , and I ’ll breathe life back in . You know it . I know it . They know it . ”
134136	134143	134144	134144	he	5148	“ Make it happen , Charles , ”
134152	134158	134144	134144	he	5148	“ I have to go . ”
134274	134285	134261	134261	I	5148	“ Dammit , Nik . Get rid of the grin . ”
134286	134297	134261	134261	I	5148	“ My face does n’t even show in the painting . ”
134298	134303	134304	134304	Blaine	2099	“ I can tell , ”
134307	134312	134304	134304	Blaine	2099	“ So stop it . ”
134319	134324	134313	134313	He	2099	“ Yes , sir , ”
134345	134347	134349	134349	our	2078	“ sir ”
135096	135102	135103	135103	Blaine	2099	“ You ’re smiling again , ”
135106	135138	135103	135103	Blaine	2099	“ I do n’t even need three guesses to know what you ’re thinking about . Or who . Do I need to kick our personal Medici out of the room ? ”
135139	135152	135153	135153	Damien	5148	“ You ’re just going to have to live with her smile , ”
135176	135191	135164	135164	I	5148	“ Because nothing ’s making me leave this room unless Nikki is beside me . ”
135316	135322	135323	135323	he	5148	“ This is our time , ”
135334	135342	135343	135343	I	5148	“ Should I alert the financial papers ? ”
135347	135363	135343	135343	I	5148	“ Does n’t it affect the market when Damien Stark takes a day off work ? ”
135364	135382	135383	135383	He	5148	“ I ’m willing to risk global economic collapse if it means a few hours with you . ”
135396	135413	135414	135414	His	5148	“ Of course , the more shopping we do , the more we support the economy . ”
135426	135455	135414	135414	His	5148	“ Or maybe we should go back to the apartment . I can think of several interesting ways to spend the afternoon that have no fiscal impact whatsoever . ”
135456	135459	135460	135460	I	5148	“ Tempting , ”
135464	135486	135460	135460	I	5148	“ But I do n’t think that I could stand the guilt knowing that I traded an orgasm for fiscal ruin . ”
135487	135501	135414	135414	His	5148	“ Trust me , baby . It would be more than one orgasm . ”
135661	135672	135646	135646	He	2099	“ Damn , Nikki , you were in the zone . ”
135673	135678	135679	135679	I	5148	“ Are you done ? ”
135712	135715	135716	135716	He	2099	“ Almost . ”
135730	135734	135735	135735	he	2099	“ Right here , ”
135744	135762	135763	135763	He	2099	“ The light on your shoulder , the way your skin glows , the mix of colors … ”
135774	135777	135778	135778	he	2099	“ Damn , ”
135782	135813	135778	135778	he	2099	“ I am a fucking genius . This is you , kid . If I did n’t know better , I ’d swear you could walk right off the canvas . ”
135814	135825	135826	135826	I	5148	“ So you ’re done ? I can come look ? ”
136184	136187	136175	136175	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
136632	136635	136636	136636	I	5148	“ Well ? ”
136647	136653	136636	136636	I	5148	“ What do you think ? ”
136704	136716	136699	136699	he	2099	“ Come on , man . It ’s perfect , right ? ”
136736	136743	136744	136744	he	2099	“ It ’s more than perfect , ”
136751	136756	136744	136744	he	2099	“ It ’s her . ”
136765	136805	136757	136757	Blaine	2099	“ I got ta say , I ’ve never been shy about bragging on my own work , but this is … well , it ’s wow . Real . Sensual . Most of all , it ’s honest . ”
136981	137001	136967	136967	Blaine	2099	“ Nik , do n’t move . I just want to touch up the light right here , and — ”
137056	137059	137049	137049	I	5148	“ What ? ”
137556	137568	137569	137569	Blaine	2099	“ Well , hell , Nikki . Now you ’re frowning . ”
137578	137601	137569	137569	Blaine	2099	“ Sometimes I wish I could crawl into that mind of yours . I ’d love to know what you ’re thinking . ”
137607	137611	137612	137612	I	5148	“ Deep thoughts , ”
137615	137621	137612	137612	I	5148	“ But not bad ones . ”
137622	137625	137626	137626	he	5148	“ Good , ”
137724	137730	137711	137711	he	2099	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
137734	137745	137711	137711	he	2099	“ Nothing that looking at you wo n’t make better . ”
137905	137918	137897	137897	Damien	5148	“ Do you have any idea how much you mean to me ? ”
137919	137922	137923	137923	I	5148	“ I — ”
137932	137935	137936	137936	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
137939	137948	137936	137936	I	5148	“ As much as you mean to me . ”
138116	138182	138187	138187	Damien	5148	“ Yeah , right . So , I ’m going to head on out . The cocktail party ’s not until seven on Saturday , right ? So I ’ll come by that afternoon and see if she needs any last minute touch - ups . And I ’ll take care of hanging her when I set up the rest of the canvases on easels . ”
138183	138186	138187	138187	Damien	5148	“ Perfect , ”
138195	138201	138202	138202	Blaine	2099	“ I got ta say , ”
138211	138219	138206	138206	he	2099	“ I ’m going to miss this . ”
138242	138245	138246	138246	he	2099	“ Yes , ”
138249	138253	138246	138246	he	2099	“ So am I. ”
138305	138311	138312	138312	I	5148	“ Is it really done ? ”
138315	138323	138312	138312	I	5148	“ I still have n’t seen it . ”
138324	138328	138329	138329	He	2099	“ Come here . ”
138436	138455	138428	138428	Damien	5148	“ Why , Ms. Fairchild , surely you do n’t expect me to sabotage such an amazing opportunity . ”
138456	138459	138460	138460	I	5148	“ Mmm . ”
138808	138811	138785	138785	I	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
138842	138847	138848	138848	I	5148	“ He ’s talented , ”
138859	138866	138848	138848	I	5148	“ It ’s a wonderful portrait . ”
138867	138871	138872	138872	he	5148	“ It is , ”
138875	138885	138872	138872	he	5148	“ Everything about it is exactly what I want . ”
138933	138936	138937	138937	I	5148	“ What ? ”
138954	138970	138971	138971	He	5148	“ It will be a miracle if I get any work done in this room . ”
138987	138998	138971	138971	He	5148	“ And I damn sure should n’t entertain in here . ”
138999	139002	139003	139003	He	5148	“ Oh ? ”
139021	139042	139018	139018	Damien	5148	“ I find that it ’s a social faux pas to host a party with a permanent hard - on . ”
139043	139061	138971	138971	He	5148	“ Well , then , perhaps you should have planned to hang the painting in the bedroom . ”
139062	139081	139018	139018	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t need the image in my bedroom . Not when I have the real thing . ”
139082	139087	139088	139088	I	5148	“ And you do , ”
139095	139112	139088	139088	I	5148	“ Bought and paid for . At least until midnight when I turn into a pumpkin . ”
139121	139124	139125	139125	he	5148	“ Midnight , ”
139198	139201	139252	139252	he	5148	“ sir , ”
139247	139251	139252	139252	he	5148	“ Follow me , ”
139272	139276	139257	139257	I	5148	“ Untie me . ”
139538	139541	139542	139542	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
139566	139576	139542	139542	I	5148	“ I thought you were going to free me . ”
139577	139585	139542	139542	I	5148	“ Bought and paid for , remember ? ”
139586	139589	139590	139590	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
139598	139601	139602	139602	he	5148	“ Come , ”
139768	139771	139772	139772	he	5148	“ Later , ”
139775	139786	139772	139772	he	5148	“ Right now , I have something else in mind . ”
140009	140019	140020	140020	I	5148	“ I do n’t remember seeing that one before , ”
140050	140055	140056	140056	His	5148	“ Do n’t you ? ”
140073	140099	140056	140056	His	5148	“ I can assure you that wo n’t be a problem after you put it on . No one will be able to forget it . ”
140100	140106	140107	140107	I	5148	“ Least of all you ? ”
140244	140256	140257	140257	he	5148	“ There is nothing about you that I could ever forget , ”
140260	140327	140257	140257	he	5148	“ You are burned into my memory . Your hair glittering in candlelight . Your skin , dewy and soft , as you step out of the shower . The way you move beneath me when we make love . And the way you look at me , as if there is nothing you could see inside me that would make you want to turn away . ”
140328	140333	140334	140334	I	5148	“ There ’s not , ”
140440	140443	140444	140444	I	5148	“ How ? ”
140460	140464	140444	140444	I	5148	“ How what ? ”
140465	140481	140444	140444	I	5148	“ How can you make love to me with only the whisper of a touch ? ”
140482	140495	140499	140499	his	5148	“ I ’m a very resourceful man . I thought you knew . ”
140515	140526	140504	140504	I	5148	“ Perhaps I should offer you a more imaginative demonstration ? ”
140527	140530	140531	140531	I	5148	“ Imaginative ? ”
140539	140617	140504	140504	I	5148	“ I ’m going to make you come , darling Nikki . Without the touch of my hands , without the caress of my body . But I ’ll be watching . I ’ll see the way your lips part , the way your skin flushes . I ’ll watch as you try to control yourself . And I ’ll tell you a secret , Nikki . I ’m going to be fighting for control , too . ”
140674	140682	140683	140683	I	5148	“ What are you going to do ? ”
140901	140909	140910	140910	he	5148	“ Do n’t worry , Ms. Fairchild , ”
140913	140924	140910	140910	he	5148	“ I promise there ’s more where that came from . ”
141111	141114	141115	141115	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
141125	141131	141115	141115	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
141132	141137	141138	141138	he	5148	“ What I want , ”
141278	141304	141271	141271	he	5148	“ I ’m tempted to commission another painting , Ms. Fairchild . I think I ’d like to have you like this all the time . ”
141308	141341	141305	141305	I	5148	“ Are we negotiating , Mr. Stark ? I do n’t come cheap , but for someone of your discriminating taste , I ’m quite certain that we could come to terms . ”
141357	141384	141342	141342	He	5148	“ There is very little that I ’d like more than to negotiate with you . But I ’m afraid we ’re running out of time . ”
141385	141388	141342	141342	He	5148	“ Time ? ”
141389	141394	141395	141395	he	5148	“ Places to go , ”
141398	141403	141395	141395	he	5148	“ People to see . ”
141435	141446	141423	141423	I	5148	“ I do n’t think I ’m dressed for company . ”
141447	141490	141407	141407	his	5148	“ It ’s just as well that the traditional morals of our society do n’t allow me to take you out like this . I ’m a very selfish man , and I have no interest in sharing you with the world . ”
141491	141495	141496	141496	I	5148	“ Believe me , ”
141507	141516	141496	141496	I	5148	“ I have no interest in being shared . ”
141592	141634	141650	141650	My	5148	“ I ’m exceptionally glad to hear that , Ms. Fairchild . Especially since , as you reminded me , you are my exclusive property until midnight . Completely mine to do with as I wish . Is n’t that so ? ”
141635	141638	141681	141681	he	5148	“ Yes . ”
141639	141649	141650	141650	My	5148	“ To touch , to tease , to tempt . ”
141663	141670	141681	141681	he	5148	“ To punish and to praise . ”
141671	141674	141675	141675	My	5148	“ Damien — ”
141697	141708	141709	141709	he	5148	“ To clothe , to feed . Mine , Nikki , ”
141729	141738	141739	141739	He	5148	“ Mine to protect , mine to cherish . ”
141750	141768	141739	141739	He	5148	“ Mine to rule . Tell me , Nikki . Tell me what I want to hear . ”
141769	141774	141775	141775	I	5148	“ I ’m yours , ”
141803	141807	141808	141808	His	5148	“ Good girl . ”
141855	141860	141861	141861	I	5148	“ I ’m surprised , ”
141864	141879	141861	141861	I	5148	“ After what you said , I did n’t think you ’d free me . ”
141880	141886	141887	141887	His	5148	“ Who says I am ? ”
141900	141914	141887	141887	His	5148	“ I ’m taking care of you , Nikki . Wholly and completely . ”
142024	142033	142034	142034	he	5148	“ I ’m going to dress you now , ”
142037	142041	142034	142034	he	5148	“ Arms up . ”
142142	142145	142146	142146	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
142170	142173	142174	142174	he	5148	“ Hush , ”
142255	142267	142268	142268	I	5148	“ I do n’t think that adds much to the outfit , ”
142287	142293	142294	142294	he	5148	“ I beg to differ , ”
142335	142341	142342	142342	he	5148	“ You still need shoes , ”
142373	142378	142379	142379	he	5148	“ These will do , ”
142382	142401	142379	142379	he	5148	“ And as much as I like you in stockings , I think we ’ll skip that tonight . ”
142651	142660	142661	142661	Damien	5148	“ You ’re like a drug to me . ”
142689	142716	142661	142661	Damien	5148	“ I was n’t going to touch you — not yet . But I do n’t have the strength to deny myself the taste of you . ”
142717	142720	142748	142748	he	5148	“ Yes . ”
142759	142762	142763	142763	he	5148	“ Up , ”
142892	142898	142899	142899	he	5148	“ You are so beautiful , ”
142902	142910	142899	142899	he	5148	“ Strong and beautiful , and mine . ”
143377	143383	143384	143384	I	5148	“ Take me to bed , ”
143415	143423	143424	143424	I	5148	“ Please , take me to bed , ”
143427	143431	143432	143432	Damien	5148	“ Not yet , ”
143443	143454	143432	143432	Damien	5148	“ First , I ’m going to take you out . ”
143530	143534	143542	143542	He	5148	“ the Bugatti , ”
143536	143541	143542	143542	He	5148	“ that unpronounceable car . ”
143697	143703	143704	143704	he	5148	“ Penny for your thoughts , ”
143718	143744	143707	143707	I	5148	“ I have n’t taken a look at your balance sheets , but I think you ’re worth more than a penny , Mr. Stark . ”
143745	143750	143707	143707	I	5148	“ I ’m flattered . ”
143751	143759	143707	143707	I	5148	“ At my assessment of your value ? ”
143760	143768	143769	143769	he	5148	“ That you were thinking of me , ”
143785	143813	143814	143814	His	5148	“ Then again , I suppose I should n’t be surprised . There is n’t a moment that goes by that I do n’t think of you . ”
143826	143860	143814	143814	His	5148	“ Even at the bargain - basement price of a penny , if I was required to pay each time my thoughts turned to you , my fortune would have evaporated days ago . ”
143861	143864	143865	143865	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
143893	143912	143913	143913	I	5148	“ I guess I wo n’t charge you , then . I ’d hate to see you destitute . ”
143928	143936	143913	143913	I	5148	“ I like your cars too much . ”
143937	143949	143913	143913	I	5148	“ I imagine they make putting up with me more palatable . ”
143950	143955	143956	143956	I	5148	“ Oh , absolutely , ”
143959	143969	143970	143970	I	5148	“ The cars , the clothes , the jet . ”
143978	143982	143983	143983	He	5148	“ The paparazzi ? ”
144010	144035	144036	144036	I	5148	“ They make me want to pull out my Leica and snap pictures of them . Then we ’d see how they like it . ”
144039	144050	144036	144036	I	5148	“ On the other hand , I love that camera . ”
144074	144088	144089	144089	I	5148	“ I do n’t want to soil it by taking pictures of them . ”
144105	144108	144109	144109	Damien	5148	“ Besides , ”
144112	144145	144109	144109	Damien	5148	“ no tabloid will pay for a picture of one of them . They want you . And because of that — because of me — you’ve lost a level of privacy . ”
144482	144493	144494	144494	I	5148	“ They do n’t have anything new , do they ? ”
144536	144572	144533	144534	dear God	229	“ It ’s not like they ’ve stepped it up a notch , right ? I mean , it ’s not like someone ’s been aiming a long lens at the balcony . Have they ? ”
144573	144579	144580	144580	His	5148	“ Good God , no . ”
144610	144613	144614	144614	I	5148	“ Good , ”
144617	144621	144622	144622	I	5148	“ I thought — ”
144690	144693	144684	144684	Damien	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
144704	144726	144695	144695	I	5148	“ I just thought that since you brought up the paparazzi , that maybe that was what the call was about . ”
144727	144730	144749	144749	His	5148	“ Call ? ”
144731	144734	144735	144735	I	5148	“ Earlier , ”
144738	144748	144735	144735	I	5148	“ At the house . You looked so upset . ”
144760	144764	144749	144749	His	5148	“ Did I ? ”
144772	144783	144765	144765	I	5148	“ I doubt Blaine noticed . But I know you . ”
144784	144787	144788	144788	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
144791	144809	144788	144788	he	5148	“ Apparently you do . But no , that call had nothing to do with those vultures . ”
144856	144859	144860	144860	I	5148	“ Besides , ”
144863	144893	144860	144860	I	5148	“ the paparazzi are not one of your acquisitions . More like an infestation . I do n’t like them , but I ’m learning to live with them . ”
144935	144938	144939	144939	I	5148	“ Really , ”
144971	145010	145011	145011	I	5148	“ They ’re like fire ants in Texas . They swarm , but the trick is to just not get in the middle of them . And if you do get bit , the sting fades soon enough . ”
145021	145024	145025	145025	I	5148	“ Besides , ”
145032	145046	145025	145025	I	5148	“ your Santa Barbara hotel and your penthouse apartment make it all worthwhile . ”
145066	145075	145076	145076	he	5148	“ Do n’t forget the house in Hawaii , ”
145086	145094	145080	145080	I	5148	“ You have a house in Hawaii ? ”
145095	145102	145047	145047	He	5148	“ And an apartment in Paris . ”
145103	145116	145080	145080	I	5148	“ Oh , now you ’re just trying to make me drool . ”
145117	145149	145047	145047	He	5148	“ Have I mentioned that Stark International has several divisions in the food industry , as well as a significant share of a company that produces high - end Swiss chocolates ? ”
145171	145203	145159	145160	Itemize Stark	429	“ You realize that the fact that you have never once offered me one of those Swiss chocolates is grounds for me to hold a grudge for at least two weeks . ”
145204	145208	145209	145209	His	5148	“ Two weeks ? ”
145224	145238	145209	145209	His	5148	“ And would you be withholding sex during that time , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
145246	145259	145239	145239	I	5148	“ Hardly . The idea is to punish you , not me . ”
145260	145264	145265	145265	He	5148	“ I see . ”
145274	145296	145265	145265	He	5148	“ No need to bother Sylvia this late , then . I ’ll have her order your chocolates in the morning . ”
145300	145337	145297	145297	I	5148	“ So far the chocolates are in the lead in my assessment of your assets . But I ’m also impressed by your fabulous taste in restaurants . That ’s a hint , by the way . ”
145338	145344	145297	145297	I	5148	“ I applaud your subtlety . ”
145345	145349	145297	145297	I	5148	“ I try . ”
145350	145365	145297	145297	I	5148	“ And I ’ll reward you with the news that we ’re almost there . ”
145366	145369	145370	145370	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
146000	146005	146006	146006	I	5148	“ Let me guess , ”
146024	146030	146006	146006	I	5148	“ You own the building . ”
146088	146149	146150	146151	The valet	2175	“ This building ? No , though I might put in an offer if it comes up for sale . It ’s an office complex right now , but with this location , it could be converted to a very successful hotel . I ’d keep the rooftop restaurant , and not just because I ’m friends with the owner . ”
146173	146177	146178	146178	I	5148	“ Le Caquelon ? ”
146187	146195	146178	146178	I	5148	“ I have n’t heard of it . ”
146196	146208	146209	146209	He	2175	“ It ’s excellent . Fabulous view , even better food . ”
146220	146230	146209	146209	He	2175	“ And the tables are very , very private . ”
146231	146234	146235	146235	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
146320	146327	146328	146328	I	5148	“ What does the name mean ? ”
146451	146455	146456	146456	he	5148	“ Just walk , ”
146459	146469	146456	146456	he	5148	“ All we need to do is get inside . ”
146491	146494	146456	146456	he	5148	“ Nikki ! ”
146537	146569	146456	146456	he	5148	“ The photos that came out last week from the Miss Texas bathing suit competition have gone viral . Is it true you leaked them to promote a new modeling career ? ”
146590	146611	146456	146456	he	5148	“ What about television ? Can you confirm that you ’ll be starring in a new reality show next year ? ”
146687	146706	146707	146707	I	5148	“ Nikki , how does it feel to have snagged one of the world ’s most eligible bachelors ? ”
146758	146780	146751	146751	Damien	5148	“ Mr. Stark ! Can you comment on the rumor that you refused to attend next Friday ’s tennis center dedication ? ”
146908	146913	146895	146895	He	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
146923	146926	146914	146914	I	5148	“ Really . ”
147017	147028	147029	147030	the giant	5148	“ I am so , so sorry , my friend , ”
147041	147066	147029	147030	the giant	5148	“ A busboy saw the reservation book . It would appear he hoped to make more than just his share of the tips tonight . ”
147067	147071	147072	147072	Damien	5148	“ I see , ”
147149	147162	147171	147173	the tall man	5148	“ I ’d like to have a word with that young man . ”
147163	147170	147171	147173	the tall man	5148	“ I ’ve already dismissed him , ”
147176	147197	147171	147173	the tall man	5148	“ He was escorted off the property at the same time I came to assist you and the young lady . ”
147198	147201	147202	147202	Damien	5148	“ Good , ”
147362	147396	147356	147356	I	5148	“ They ’ll get tired of us soon enough . Some movie star will divorce some other star . Or a reality star will get caught shoplifting . We ’re boring by comparison . ”
147423	147428	147429	147429	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
147432	147443	147429	147429	he	5148	“ I should be the one making you feel better . ”
147444	147450	147451	147451	I	5148	“ I ’m with you , ”
147454	147463	147451	147451	I	5148	“ That ’s as good as it gets . ”
147478	147522	147464	147464	He	5148	“ Alaine , I ’ve forgotten my manners . I ’d like to introduce you to my girlfriend , Nikki Fairchild . Nikki , my friend Alaine Beauchene , one of the best chefs in the city and the owner of Le Caquelon . ”
147523	147534	147535	147535	he	5148	“ It ’s a very great pleasure to meet you , ”
147542	147552	147535	147535	he	5148	“ Damien has told me so many good things . ”
147553	147556	147557	147557	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
147624	147631	147632	147632	I	5148	“ Thank you for rescuing us , ”
147657	147666	147654	147654	I	5148	“ How do you two know each other ? ”
147667	147684	147654	147654	I	5148	“ Alaine ’s father practices sports medicine . We got to know each other on tour . ”
147685	147692	147693	147693	Alaine	837	“ Two young men crisscrossing Europe , ”
147697	147706	147693	147693	Alaine	837	“ Those were good times , my friend . ”
147746	147753	147754	147754	Damien	5148	“ Those were the best times , ”
147793	147801	147802	147802	Alaine	837	“ The two of us and Sofia , ”
147813	147840	147808	147808	He	837	“ Two years younger than us , and the little imp was determined to stick like glue . Have you heard anything ? How is she ? ”
147841	147844	147845	147845	Damien	5148	“ Fine , ”
147889	147894	147895	147895	he	5148	“ At any rate , ”
147905	147924	147895	147895	he	5148	“ enough about the old days . You are here now for the food , not the memories . ”
148134	148143	148144	148144	Alaine	837	“ I must get back to the kitchen , ”
148147	148184	148185	148185	His	837	“ But Monica will show you to your booth . Ms. Fairchild , it has been a pleasure . Enjoy your meal , and I hope to see both of you next Friday at the dedication . ”
148209	148216	148217	148217	Damien	5148	“ I wo n’t be attending , ”
148220	148234	148217	148217	Damien	5148	“ But I ’ll call you next week . We should have drinks . ”
148514	148521	148522	148522	Monica	437	“ Your wine is already breathing , ”
148530	148550	148522	148522	Monica	437	“ and you have both flat and sparkling water . Will you be having your usual , Mr. Stark ? ”
148551	148555	148556	148556	he	5148	“ Just dessert , ”
148559	148563	148556	148556	he	5148	“ For two . ”
148569	148588	148564	148564	She	437	“ It will be right out . In the meantime , please enjoy the wine and the view . ”
148624	148627	148628	148628	I	5148	“ Damien ! ”
148674	148684	148685	148685	Damien	5148	“ Do you know how much I ’m worth ? ”
148697	148705	148650	148650	she	437	“ I — no . Not exactly . ”
148706	148743	148744	148744	He	5148	“ It ’s more than the GNP of many countries , and it ’s damn sure enough to keep me as comfortable as I want to be for the rest of my life and then some . ”
148750	148764	148744	148744	He	5148	“ But it ’s not enough to keep those bastards away from you . ”
148769	148780	148765	148765	My	5148	“ Damien . It ’s okay . I ’m fine . ”
148781	148796	148650	148650	she	437	“ You ’re on the goddamn Internet in a bathing suit because of me . ”
148797	148861	148765	148765	My	5148	“ I ’m on the Internet in a bathing suit because my mother forced me into pageants from the time I was four . And because I did n’t have the balls to say no to her when I got older . I ’m on the Internet because of those jerks out there . I ’m not on the Internet because of you . ”
148862	148882	148883	148883	he	5148	“ I do n’t like that something that comes from me hurts you . I do n’t like it , ”
148886	148901	148883	148883	he	5148	“ But I do n’t know that I have the strength to change it . ”
148902	148906	148907	148907	I	5148	“ The strength ? ”
148951	148954	148947	148947	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
148970	148983	148984	148984	he	5148	“ I owned a small , gourmet wine and cheese company once , ”
148987	148994	148984	148984	he	5148	“ Or rather Stark International did . ”
149051	149057	149058	149058	I	5148	“ Tell me about it , ”
149061	149096	149058	149058	I	5148	“ It was an old company , family run , good reputation . I loved their products and thought it could be a profitable partnership . And it was — for about a year . ”
149097	149101	149058	149058	I	5148	“ What happened ? ”
149102	149202	149058	149058	I	5148	“ The press learned that Stark International was behind this mom - and - pop business and started lambasting them . Did n’t matter that we were n’t mass - producing the food . We had n’t changed the system . We had simply provided enough capital to let the company grow within its own parameters . But they were called out as Big Business disguised as the Little Guy , a trick designed to fool consumers . All the negative attention stopped growth cold . Suddenly a company that was solidly in the black was in the red . ”
149203	149209	149210	149210	I	5148	“ What did you do ? ”
149233	149279	149324	149324	He	2246	“ I pulled out . Very publicly and very loudly . Even so , it took a while for the business to get back on its feet . Being associated with Stark International almost destroyed the company whose cheese and wine I loved so much . ”
149280	149288	149289	149289	I	5148	“ I ’m neither cheese nor wine , ”
149293	149323	149289	149289	I	5148	“ And I ’m not spiraling down . I could never spiral down with you beside me . You hold me up , Damien . We both know it . ”
149452	149458	149459	149459	he	2246	“ I will do it , ”
149462	149484	149459	149459	he	2246	“ If that ’s what it takes to protect you , I will leave you . Even if it kills me . ”
149485	149490	149491	149491	I	5148	“ You wo n’t , ”
149510	149522	149491	149491	I	5148	“ You wo n’t because it would kill me , too . ”
149523	149528	149529	149529	He	2246	“ Oh , Nikki . ”
149595	149611	149684	149684	My	5148	“ Do you have any idea what I want to do to you right now ? ”
149612	149616	149617	149617	I	5148	“ Tell me , ”
149620	149683	149684	149684	My	5148	“ I want to strip you bare and press you up against the glass . I want to trail my fingers over you lightly , just enough to make you awaken to my touch . I want to watch the lights of the Pier flash behind you , and I want to watch my own reflection in your eyes as you come . ”
149692	149694	149684	149684	My	5148	“ oh ”
149706	149712	149713	149713	he	5148	“ But I ca n’t , ”
149716	149731	149713	149713	he	5148	“ I believe I told you that I was n’t going to touch you . ”
149732	149741	149742	149742	I	5148	“ I wo n’t hold you to it , ”
149745	149754	149713	149713	he	5148	“ But that would be breaking the rules . ”
149764	149775	149755	149755	I	5148	“ You ’re playing games with me , Mr. Stark . ”
149776	149779	149780	149780	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
149784	149788	149780	149780	he	5148	“ I am . ”
149789	149798	149799	149799	I	5148	“ I suppose that ’s fair , sir , ”
149802	149838	149799	149799	I	5148	“ I ’m yours , after all . At least for the night . But tomorrow , I ’ll be a rich woman and the game ’s going to have a new set of rules . ”
149853	149863	149864	149864	he	5148	“ You raise a good point , Ms. Fairchild , ”
149867	149880	149864	149864	he	5148	“ I need to make sure I get my money ’s worth . ”
149881	149887	149843	149843	he	5148	“ Your money ’s worth ? ”
149888	149900	149901	149901	he	5148	“ Did you read the article in Forbes I sent you ? ”
149904	149918	149901	149901	he	5148	“ The reporter did a good job of describing my philosophy in business . ”
149919	149924	149928	149928	I	5148	“ I read it . ”
149945	149950	149951	149951	he	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
149954	149959	149960	149960	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
149963	149969	149960	149960	I	5148	“ I read the article . ”
149970	149996	149997	149997	I	5148	“ Then you know that I attribute much of my success to my ability to extract as much value as possible from every monetary transaction . ”
150002	150010	149997	149997	I	5148	“ And I ’m a monetary transaction ? ”
150011	150016	149960	149960	I	5148	“ You are indeed . ”
150017	150030	149997	149997	I	5148	“ I see . And how do you intend to extract value ? ”
150031	150037	150038	150038	he	5148	“ I already told you , ”
150041	150051	150038	150038	he	5148	“ If you ’re not going to pay attention … ”
150052	150063	150064	150064	His	5148	“ You said you were going to make me come . ”
150079	150097	150064	150064	His	5148	“ So I did . Good girl . You get an A in class , after all . ”
150158	150161	150162	150162	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
150165	150171	150162	150162	I	5148	“ Do you like that ? ”
150172	150181	150204	150204	He	5148	“ Yes — oh , God , yes . ”
150182	150185	150186	150186	he	5148	“ Good , ”
150218	150224	150204	150204	He	5148	“ Frustrated , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
150225	150228	150229	150229	I	5148	“ No , ”
150252	150267	150244	150244	He	5148	“ Patience , sweetheart . Right now , I have a treat for you . ”
150294	150323	150288	150288	I	5148	“ The panels lock to allow guests their privacy . When the food arrives , the server presses a button on the outside and the button turns red . ”
150324	150330	150331	150331	I	5148	“ And green unlocks it , ”
150433	150436	150406	150406	he	5148	“ Nikki — ”
150583	150587	150573	150573	I	5148	“ Chocolate fondue ? ”
150588	150594	150595	150595	he	5148	“ I had considered cheese , ”
150611	150628	150595	150595	he	5148	“ But this way will ensure that I ’m not punished by the withholding of sex . ”
150638	150651	150629	150629	I	5148	“ Alaine imports the chocolate from the Swiss subsidiary I mentioned earlier . ”
150652	150655	150656	150656	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
150662	150679	150656	150656	I	5148	“ I already know you ’re delicious . I suppose your chocolate will be , too . ”
150700	150705	150706	150706	he	5148	“ No , no , ”
150714	150721	150709	150709	I	5148	“ Um , hello ? Chocolate . ”
150725	150730	150722	150722	He	5148	“ Close your eyes . ”
150740	150751	150722	150722	He	5148	“ Disobedience , Ms. Fairchild ? You do live dangerously … ”
150803	150806	150808	150808	my	5148	“ What — ”
150819	150829	150830	150830	I	5148	“ I made you a promise , Ms. Fairchild . ”
150847	150856	150841	150841	I	5148	“ You ’re going to make me come . ”
150857	150862	150863	150863	he	5148	“ That , too , ”
150876	150899	150863	150863	he	5148	“ I also said I was going to feed you . Conveniently , I think the two may go together very well . ”
150941	150946	150947	150947	Damien	5148	“ Open for me , ”
150994	150998	150999	150999	he	5148	“ Now bite , ”
151061	151072	151073	151073	I	5148	“ I thought you were n’t going to touch me , ”
151096	151106	151107	151107	he	5148	“ Holding me to my promise , after all ? ”
151165	151168	151169	151169	I	5148	“ No , ”
151188	151255	151185	151185	He	5148	“ Ah , but I ’m a man of integrity . But let ’s agree that I ’ll keep to the spirit of my promise and not the letter . Do you want me to gently press my fingertip against your clit ? To feel that hard nub beneath my finger ? To tease it , stroke it , to play with it until you come ? ”
151256	151259	151185	151185	He	5148	“ I — ”
151260	151282	151185	151185	He	5148	“ Shhh . You do n’t speak , Nikki . Not until I say that you can . Do you understand ? ”
151286	151359	151283	151283	I	5148	“ Good . Let ’s continue to discuss the parameters of my promise . Perhaps you want me to slide my hands between your legs . To spread you wide . To lay you back on this bench and kiss my way up your legs . To breathe in the scent of your sex , and dip my tongue in your sweet folds , more delicious than any chocolate could ever be ? ”
151373	151383	151388	151388	Damien	5148	“ Maybe you just want me to fuck you . ”
151393	151456	151388	151388	Damien	5148	“ To all of those possibilities , Ms. Fairchild , I am saying no . I promised I would n’t touch you , and I wo n’t . I wo n’t touch your sex , at any rate . As for the rest of you — well , perhaps we shall make one or two small exceptions . Nod if you understand . ”
151460	151468	151457	151457	I	5148	“ Good girl . Now try this . ”
151506	151510	151511	151511	Damien	5148	“ Naughty girl , ”
151514	151523	151528	151528	he	5148	“ Not even leaving a taste for me . ”
151658	151664	151665	151665	he	5148	“ Pull your arm in , ”
151704	151721	151689	151689	he	5148	“ That looked like such a good idea , I may have to try it myself . ”
152046	152053	152054	152054	Damien	5148	“ So tell me , Nikki , ”
152063	152070	152054	152054	Damien	5148	“ Did you enjoy your dessert ? ”
152071	152076	152054	152054	Damien	5148	“ God , yes . ”
152077	152083	152084	152084	he	5148	“ Do you want more ? ”
152142	152148	152149	152149	I	5148	“ No more than that , ”
152152	152162	152149	152149	I	5148	“ Now the only thing I want is you . ”
152339	152342	152343	152343	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
152464	152470	152471	152471	he	5148	“ Take off your clothes , ”
152538	152541	152542	152542	he	5148	“ No , ”
152545	152549	152542	152542	he	5148	“ Leave it . ”
152735	152738	152739	152739	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
152865	152872	152873	152873	he	5148	“ I want to go slow , ”
152882	152909	152873	152873	he	5148	“ I want to make you moan with anticipation and writhe with need of me . I want you so ready that you beg for me . ”
152919	152931	152910	152910	I	5148	“ But , dammit , Nikki , I ca n’t wait . ”
152932	152937	152938	152938	I	5148	“ Then do n’t , ”
152957	152966	152975	152975	he	5148	“ God , what you do to me . ”
153135	153138	153139	153139	he	5148	“ No , ”
153148	153152	153153	153153	he	5148	“ Bend over , ”
153156	153162	153153	153153	he	5148	“ Hands on the bed . ”
153192	153209	153177	153177	I	5148	“ For someone who says he ca n’t wait you ’re taking an awfully long time . ”
153210	153235	153236	153236	he	5148	“ Perhaps I ’m waiting for an apology . It ’s not kind to remind a man that heaven is ending in mere hours , ”
153240	153276	153236	153236	he	5148	“ A young woman with your meticulous upbringing should have more tact than to bring up such a sore subject several times over the course of one evening . Whatever happened to etiquette and decorum ? ”
153277	153302	153177	153177	I	5148	“ That ’s a very good question , Mr. Stark . Perhaps I ’m not as polite and refined as you think I am . ”
153303	153307	153308	153308	he	5148	“ Perhaps not , ”
153318	153343	153308	153308	he	5148	“ I do n’t like being reminded that the end is near . It was quite unkind of you to mention it so boldly . ”
153344	153348	153349	153349	I	5148	“ Quite unkind , ”
153352	153372	153349	153349	I	5148	“ Rude , even . Definitely thoughtless . And certainly not worthy of the Emily Post seal of approval . ”
153397	153404	153389	153389	I	5148	“ Maybe you should punish me . ”
153435	153439	153440	153440	he	5148	“ Should I ? ”
153450	153508	153440	153440	he	5148	“ Do you think I did n’t see the way you dug your nails into your thighs in the car on the way to the restaurant ? We were only talking about the paparazzi then . It was worse when they accosted us . You kept control , Nikki , but you had to fight for it . ”
153519	153526	153527	153527	His	5148	“ Nikki , look at me . ”
153666	153669	153670	153670	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
153962	153967	153968	153968	he	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki , ”
153971	153976	153968	153968	he	5148	“ Talk to me . ”
154032	154037	154038	154038	I	5148	“ I need you , ”
154047	154056	154038	154038	I	5148	“ You . I do n’t need that . ”
154097	154104	154105	154105	I	5148	“ I do n’t need it , ”
154108	154114	154105	154105	I	5148	“ but I want it . ”
154135	154139	154140	154140	he	5148	“ Do you ? ”
154210	154215	154216	154216	I	5148	“ I want it , ”
154219	154234	154216	154216	I	5148	“ And not because I need the pain . But because I need you . ”
154303	154319	154294	154294	He	5148	“ I need you , too , Nikki . God , how I need you . ”
154335	154340	154320	154320	I	5148	“ Then touch me . ”
154422	154425	154426	154426	he	5148	“ Bed , ”
154435	154442	154426	154426	he	5148	“ Bend over . Legs apart . ”
154450	154454	154443	154443	I	5148	“ Bossy much ? ”
154472	154478	154455	154455	He	5148	“ What do you say ? ”
154479	154484	154485	154485	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
154637	154642	154643	154643	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
154737	154745	154746	154746	Damien	5148	“ Oh , you have been naughty , ”
155215	155220	155221	155221	he	5148	“ As you wish , ”
155363	155368	155369	155369	he	5148	“ You ’re close , ”
155389	155392	155393	155393	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
155409	155413	155414	155414	he	5148	“ Touch yourself , ”
155437	155440	155441	155441	I	5148	“ What ? ”
155481	155486	155487	155487	I	5148	“ You heard me . ”
155531	155540	155541	155541	I	5148	“ I — I thought that was naughty , ”
155558	155565	155548	155548	His	5148	“ Maybe I like you naughty . ”
155710	155721	155699	155699	I	5148	“ Jesus , Nikki , I ca n’t hold back . ”
155722	155727	155728	155728	I	5148	“ Then do n’t . ”
155792	155795	155796	155796	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
155837	155845	155846	155846	I	5148	“ I think you ’ve unraveled me , ”
155849	155865	155846	155846	I	5148	“ If you were going for punishment , though , you missed the mark completely . ”
155866	155870	155871	155871	His	5148	“ Did I ? ”
155876	155898	155871	155871	His	5148	“ Sounds to me like you ’re assuming I ’m done with you . I assure you , I ’m not . ”
155899	155902	155903	155903	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
155910	155920	155903	155903	My	5148	“ That ’s a very interesting bit of information . ”
155921	155931	155932	155932	He	5148	“ I ’m glad to hear you ’re intrigued . ”
155942	155959	155932	155932	He	5148	“ But this time maybe you ought to lie down . You seem a bit unsteady . ”
155960	155964	155965	155965	He	5148	“ You think ? ”
156027	156037	156038	156038	he	5148	“ Do n’t go to sleep on me yet , ”
156082	156098	156070	156070	His	5148	“ I ’m going to enjoy this . And , Nikki ? So will you . ”
156150	156154	156137	156137	He	5148	“ Left hand . ”
156190	156193	156194	156194	Damien	5148	“ Nice , ”
156206	156216	156198	156198	he	5148	“ But I think we can make it nicer . ”
156305	156311	156312	156312	he	5148	“ Remember our first night ? ”
156361	156364	156357	156357	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
156365	156370	156371	156371	he	5148	“ So do I , ”
156661	156666	156667	156667	he	5148	“ Do n’t worry , ”
156678	156702	156667	156667	he	5148	“ I might have it in me to torment you a little bit , but tonight that would be torturing me , too . ”
156703	156709	156710	156710	I	5148	“ Sadism , not masochism ? ”
156722	156759	156760	156760	He	5148	“ Sadism , Ms. Fairchild ? Let me see if I recall the definition . I believe that sadism is the deriving of sexual gratification from inflicting pain , suffering , or humiliation on another person . ”
156774	156807	156760	156760	He	5148	“ I ’ll admit to the sexual gratification — and I intend to be significantly more gratified before the night is over — but let ’s explore the rest , shall we ? ”
156840	156853	156854	156854	I	5148	“ So tell me , Ms. Fairchild , are you in pain ? ”
156873	156876	156865	156865	I	5148	“ No . ”
156877	156886	156887	156887	He	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear it . ”
156914	156922	156923	156923	he	5148	“ Candle wax can be very enticing , ”
156932	156961	156923	156923	he	5148	“ The sensation of the quickly changing temperature . The way it tightens when it hardens on the skin . Have you ever experienced that , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
156967	156970	156962	156962	I	5148	“ No . ”
156982	156985	156986	156986	he	5148	“ Mmm , ”
156998	157014	156986	156986	he	5148	“ Well , today , I ’m interested in only one thing from this candle . ”
157101	157104	157171	157171	My	5148	“ Oh … ”
157105	157108	157109	157109	he	5148	“ Disappointed ? ”
157112	157115	157116	157116	I	5148	“ No , ”
157125	157135	157116	157116	I	5148	“ But I might have been a little intrigued . ”
157136	157158	157159	157159	He	5148	“ Were you ? I ’ll have to remember that . But where were we ? Oh , yes . Sadism . ”
157199	157240	157241	157241	he	5148	“ Humiliation was next , I believe . Are you humiliated , Ms. Fairchild ? You ’re exposed to me , after all . Wide open like a blossoming flower and so very wet . You ’re beautiful , Nikki , ”
157254	157260	157241	157241	he	5148	“ But are you humiliated ? ”
157324	157327	157328	157328	I	5148	“ No , ”
157331	157336	157328	157328	I	5148	“ Look at me . ”
157367	157371	157372	157372	he	5148	“ Not humiliated , ”
157375	157385	157372	157372	he	5148	“ And not suffering , either , I assume ? ”
157386	157389	157372	157372	he	5148	“ No . ”
157390	157393	157394	157394	His	5148	“ Good . ”
157424	157432	157433	157433	he	5148	“ You are exceptional , Ms. Fairchild , ”
157436	157450	157433	157433	he	5148	“ I could look at you forever . Lose myself in you forever . ”
157498	157508	157509	157509	he	5148	“ I like that I can make you blush , ”
157515	157518	157512	157512	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
157519	157527	157512	157512	I	5148	“ Because I know why you do . ”
157528	157543	157512	157512	I	5148	“ Really ? Well , then please , Mr. Stark , share your insight . ”
157544	157581	157512	157512	I	5148	“ Because I have you spread open . Because you ’re naked before me and helpless . Because I can do anything to you right now , anything at all . And because that excites you . ”
157603	157627	157512	157512	I	5148	“ So tell me , Ms. Fairchild . If you ’re not in pain or suffering or humiliated , how do you feel ? ”
157628	157632	157633	157633	I	5148	“ Turned on , ”
157682	157699	157677	157677	he	5148	“ Hush , now , and close your eyes . I ’m going to kiss you . ”
158215	158218	158221	158221	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
158310	158316	158317	158317	he	5148	“ Less than a minute , ”
158333	158344	158317	158317	he	5148	“ Do you turn into a pumpkin or do I ? ”
158362	158375	158376	158376	I	5148	“ I do n’t think I ’d like you as a pumpkin , ”
158385	158393	158376	158376	I	5148	“ And I look terrible in orange . ”
158481	158487	158488	158488	he	5148	“ You ’re still mine , ”
158566	158569	158555	158555	He	5148	“ Nikki . ”
158615	158619	158620	158620	I	5148	“ Untie me , ”
158657	158660	158661	158661	I	5148	“ Hello ? ”
158673	158688	158661	158661	I	5148	“ Did you get lost between the middle of the bed and the headboard ? ”
158689	158696	158697	158697	he	5148	“ I ’m considering my options , ”
158700	158705	158697	158697	he	5148	“ Why should I ? ”
158706	158715	158661	158661	I	5148	“ Because my arms will cramp up soon . ”
158716	158725	158697	158697	he	5148	“ I ’ll be happy to massage you . ”
158733	158752	158726	158726	I	5148	“ And because you have a cocktail party here on Saturday , and your guests will ask questions . ”
158753	158774	158661	158661	I	5148	“ Perhaps , but wo n’t it be nice to know that the guests will have plenty to talk about ? ”
158775	158801	158726	158726	I	5148	“ As much as I hate the thought of depriving your guests of interesting conversation , I would still like my hands to be free . ”
158802	158806	158807	158807	He	5148	“ Would you ? ”
158849	158866	158842	158842	my	5148	“ And what is it that you wish to do with your hands , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
158867	158871	158872	158872	I	5148	“ Touch you , ”
158876	158901	158872	158872	I	5148	“ I ’m allowed . After all , we ’re on equal footing now that midnight has passed . Are n’t we , sir ? ”
158918	158923	158924	158924	he	5148	“ Yes , madam , ”
158942	158946	158927	158927	he	5148	“ We are . ”
159129	159136	159137	159137	I	5148	“ You make me feel amazing , ”
159140	159149	159137	159137	I	5148	“ I want you to feel the same . ”
159150	159201	159137	159137	I	5148	“ I do . When I touch you . When I see your skin tremble with desire . When your muscles tighten and draw me in . What is it you think that you ’re doing to me other than making me feel more deeply than I ever have before ? ”
159202	159211	159212	159212	I	5148	“ But you ’re the one in control . ”
159230	159233	159234	159234	He	5148	“ No . ”
159239	159280	159234	159234	He	5148	“ That ’s an illusion . It ’s you , Nikki . You have captured me utterly , and you hold my heart in your hands . Be gentle with it . It ’s more fragile than you might think . ”
159334	159340	159341	159341	I	5148	“ What do you want ? ”
159350	159371	159341	159341	I	5148	“ Right now , if you could have me any way you wanted , what would you have me do ? ”
159372	159382	159383	159383	he	5148	“ Right now , I want you beside me , ”
159386	159393	159383	159383	he	5148	“ I want to hold you . ”
159479	159488	159489	159489	I	5148	“ I ’m going to miss this bed , ”
159492	159510	159489	159489	I	5148	“ I suppose I could keep it here . But it does n’t really fit the decor . ”
159511	159523	159489	159489	I	5148	“ Well , if you ’re trying to be all traditional … ”
159658	159661	159662	159662	I	5148	“ What ? ”
159665	159672	159662	159662	I	5148	“ Having fun , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
159673	159683	159653	159653	his	5148	“ As a matter of fact , I am . ”
159684	159704	159662	159662	I	5148	“ I ’m glad . Earlier — the way those bastards upset you . I did n’t like it . ”
159705	159710	159711	159711	I	5148	“ Me , neither , ”
159724	159738	159711	159711	I	5148	“ But I ’m okay now . And you seem pretty okay yourself . ”
159739	159752	159753	159753	he	5148	“ I would have happily ripped their heads off at the restaurant , ”
159756	159761	159762	159762	I	5148	“ I could tell , ”
159765	159775	159762	159762	I	5148	“ But I did n’t just mean the paparazzi . ”
159776	159779	159780	159780	he	5148	“ Oh ? ”
159790	159799	159800	159800	I	5148	“ I ’m still wondering about that call , ”
159803	159809	159810	159810	I	5148	“ Is something going on ? ”
159829	159835	159810	159810	I	5148	“ Has Carl done something ? ”
159849	159874	159842	159842	I	5148	“ Come on , Damien . All that stuff that Carl said — we both know it is n’t going to just go away . ”
159875	159884	159885	159885	Damien	5148	“ I hope it does just go away , ”
159888	159895	159885	159885	Damien	5148	“ Though I tend to agree . ”
159896	159899	159900	159900	I	5148	“ Damien ! ”
159908	159935	159900	159900	I	5148	“ Just tell me straight out . Has something happened that you have n’t told me about ? Is that what the phone call was about ? ”
159936	159939	159940	159940	He	5148	“ No . ”
159951	159955	159940	159940	He	5148	“ I promise . ”
160011	160017	160004	160004	he	5148	“ Shall we pinkie swear ? ”
160030	160036	160037	160037	he	5148	“ I swear to you , ”
160053	160064	160037	160037	he	5148	“ that call had nothing to do with Carl Rosenfeld . ”
160458	160461	160451	160451	He	5148	“ Damien ? ”
160529	160531	160517	160517	he	5148	“ anywhere ”
162510	162519	162498	162498	He	5148	“ I did n’t mean to wake you . ”
162520	162533	162498	162498	He	5148	“ How do you expect me to sleep without you beside me ? ”
162622	162630	162631	162631	I	5148	“ I think I ruined the robe , ”
162634	162656	162631	162631	I	5148	“ I did n’t actually mean to wear it into the pool . I was watching you and got carried away . ”
162657	162663	162664	162664	His	5148	“ I know the feeling . ”
162692	162701	162710	162710	he	5148	“ Do you mind that I ’m here ? ”
162724	162730	162715	162715	I	5148	“ What do you think ? ”
162796	162801	162802	162802	I	5148	“ I was worried , ”
162805	162822	162802	162802	I	5148	“ About the phone call ? I told you it was n’t about Carl ’s threats . ”
162832	162840	162823	162823	I	5148	“ Was it about the tennis center ? ”
162847	162853	162841	162841	He	5148	“ You know about that ? ”
162854	162862	162841	162841	He	5148	“ Is that what ’s bothering you ? ”
162872	162875	162863	162863	He	5148	“ Yes . ”
162897	162905	162863	162863	He	5148	“ How did you learn about it ? ”
162906	162920	162876	162876	I	5148	“ I saw the paper . You left it by the boxing bag . ”
162929	162939	162924	162924	his	5148	“ Perhaps my subconscious wanted you to find it . ”
162940	162943	162944	162944	I	5148	“ Well , ”
162950	162956	162944	162944	I	5148	“ That ’s a start . ”
163005	163014	163015	163015	he	5148	“ I ’m not a fan of Richter , ”
163018	163034	163015	163015	he	5148	“ The idea that a professional tennis facility will bear his name pisses me off . ”
163035	163042	163015	163015	he	5148	“ Ca n’t you do something ? ”
163043	163051	163052	163052	he	5148	“ I could buy the goddamned center , ”
163055	163061	163052	163052	he	5148	“ But I wo n’t . ”
163119	163126	163127	163127	he	5148	“ The call that upset me , ”
163130	163137	163127	163127	he	5148	“ It was from my father . ”
163138	163141	163142	163142	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
163302	163311	163298	163298	I	5148	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”
163312	163315	163287	163287	I	5148	“ No . ”
163323	163328	163329	163329	I	5148	“ Right . Okay . ”
163358	163365	163366	163366	he	2334	“ I know it bothers you , ”
163369	163375	163366	163366	he	2334	“ And I ’m sorry . ”
163526	163532	163533	163533	I	5148	“ It does bother me , ”
163536	163549	163533	163533	I	5148	“ But only because I do n’t like to see you wounded . ”
163550	163562	163563	163563	He	2334	“ And here I thought I hid my scars so well . ”
163570	163574	163575	163575	I	5148	“ You do , ”
163578	163628	163575	163575	I	5148	“ But you ’re talking to an expert at hiding scars . I see them even if no one else does . And I know how much it helped me to talk to you . To know that I could borrow your strength if my own was n’t enough . ”
163648	163680	163681	163681	I	5148	“ I mean it when I say that I want to be there for you , Damien , but saying it that way makes me sound more altruistic than I am . ”
163697	163724	163681	163681	I	5148	“ The truth is that it feels unfair . I ’ve shared everything with you , but you still keep so many things locked up tight . ”
163725	163728	163681	163681	I	5148	“ Nikki — ”
163729	163732	163733	163733	I	5148	“ No , ”
163736	163789	163733	163733	I	5148	“ This is n’t a demand or an accusation . It ’s an apology . Because it was my choice to tell you , and it ’s unfair of me to be irritated because you have n’t made the same choice . It ’s not like we ’re playing Follow the Leader . ”
163790	163793	163794	163794	he	5148	“ No , ”
163810	163833	163798	163798	I	5148	“ But considering how much I enjoyed our game of Simon Says , perhaps we should add that one to our repertoire . ”
163841	163846	163834	163834	I	5148	“ I ’m serious . ”
163847	163853	163854	163854	He	5148	“ I know you are . ”
163857	163861	163854	163854	He	5148	“ Thank you . ”
163977	163984	163956	163956	I	5148	“ What are you thinking about ? ”
163985	163988	163989	163989	I	5148	“ You , ”
163992	163996	163989	163989	I	5148	“ Always you . ”
163997	164002	163956	163956	I	5148	“ What about me ? ”
164010	164024	164003	164003	I	5148	“ Close your eyes , Mr. Stark , and I ’ll show you . ”
164049	164061	164062	164062	My	5148	“ I ’m going to make love to you , Damien . ”
164077	164101	164062	164062	My	5148	“ I ’m going to take your mind off everything that ’s bothering you . And a lot more effectively than swimming laps . ”
164696	164703	164704	164704	he	5148	“ Tell me you trust me , ”
164707	164714	164704	164704	he	5148	“ You know that I do . ”
164715	164727	164762	164762	he	5148	“ Tell me I can take you however I want to . ”
164740	164745	164728	164728	I	5148	“ Oh , yes . ”
164746	164757	164758	164758	he	5148	“ I ’m going to make you shatter , Nikki , ”
164790	164846	164770	164770	He	5148	“ I want to feel my hands on you when you explode , and I want to know that I ’m the one who gave that to you . Every breath , every ripple of pleasure , every ache in your cunt , every bite mark on your back . Me . I did that . ”
164861	164871	164872	164872	he	5148	“ Hold on to the side of the pool , ”
165172	165177	165183	165183	his	5148	“ Everywhere , Nikki . ”
165292	165295	165296	165296	he	5148	“ Forever , ”
165641	165644	165645	165645	he	5148	“ Goddammit , ”
165648	165653	165645	165645	he	5148	“ Nikki . I — ”
165654	165657	165658	165658	I	5148	“ No . ”
165663	165666	165667	165667	I	5148	“ No , ”
165670	165693	165667	165667	I	5148	“ Do n’t you get it ? I want to be there for you . All of you . Whatever you need . ”
165702	165708	165709	165709	he	5148	“ Did I hurt you ? ”
165717	165720	165709	165709	he	5148	“ No . ”
165753	165756	165757	165757	I	5148	“ No , ”
165760	165765	165757	165757	I	5148	“ You felt wonderful . ”
165930	165940	165923	165923	his	5148	“ My father intends to go to the dedication . ”
165941	165944	165945	165945	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
165974	166007	165923	165923	his	5148	“ I wo n’t be there . Richter was a balls - out bastard , and I wo n’t support the decision to honor him , not even in the smallest way . ”
166008	166016	165945	165945	I	5148	“ Of course you wo n’t go . ”
166017	166024	165923	165923	his	5148	“ I ’m glad you understand . ”
166025	166053	165945	165945	I	5148	“ I ’m glad you have the balls to stand up to your father . I do n’t think I could ignore an edict from my mother . ”
166054	166060	166061	166061	he	5148	“ I bet you could , ”
166064	166072	166061	166061	he	5148	“ You ’re stronger than you think . ”
166085	166101	166080	166080	I	5148	“ And the tennis center thing is all that ’s been bugging you ? Truly ? ”
166102	166105	166106	166106	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
166232	166238	166239	166239	I	5148	“ What ’s all this ? ”
166242	166260	166261	166261	he	5148	“ A woman heading off to the first day of a new job deserves breakfast in bed , ”
166300	166306	166281	166281	I	5148	“ What time is it ? ”
166307	166312	166313	166313	he	5148	“ Just past six , ”
166322	166332	166313	166313	he	5148	“ When are you supposed to be at work ? ”
166333	166336	166337	166337	I	5148	“ Ten , ”
166340	166394	166337	166337	I	5148	“ Bruce is having me start on a Friday since it ’s going to be a day of paperwork and getting my feet wet . Probably the last truly relaxing week I ’ll have for a long time . Monday , I ’ll be dragging myself in by eight , I ’m sure . ”
166395	166409	166410	166410	He	5148	“ Do n’t even pretend to complain . You know you love it . ”
166553	166561	166562	166562	I	5148	“ Where did you get fresh croissants ? ”
166585	166588	166589	166589	Damien	5148	“ Edward , ”
166597	166603	166589	166589	Damien	5148	“ Thank him for me . ”
166604	166628	166589	166589	Damien	5148	“ You can thank him yourself . Unless you ’re planning to walk to work , he ’ll be giving you a lift . ”
166629	166633	166589	166589	Damien	5148	“ Not you ? ”
166634	166653	166654	166654	He	2362	“ While I would love to carpool with you , I ’m afraid that ’s not possible today . ”
166698	166703	166704	166704	he	2362	“ You ’re right , ”
166707	166710	166704	166704	he	2362	“ Delicious . ”
166711	166735	166694	166696	a mischievous child	2363	“ You owe me now , mister . You ca n’t expect to steal a woman ’s pastry and get away with it . ”
166736	166747	166748	166748	he	2362	“ I look forward to your just and severe punishment , ”
166761	166775	166753	166753	He	2362	“ Or perhaps I could make it up to you in the shower . ”
166776	166783	166784	166784	I	5148	“ I do n’t think so , ”
166788	166801	166784	166784	I	5148	“ I do n’t want to be late for my first day . ”
166802	166813	166753	166753	He	2362	“ I thought you were n’t due in until ten . ”
166831	166846	166847	166847	I	5148	“ I ’m not . But I need to get home and get dressed . ”
166854	166866	166847	166847	I	5148	“ And I need to shower off last night ’s sex . ”
166867	166875	166876	166876	he	2362	“ That ’s a very sad thought , ”
166879	166900	166876	166876	he	2362	“ Of course , if you insist on taking such drastic action , I did offer to share my shower . ”
166951	166961	166962	166962	I	5148	“ Looks like you managed just fine without me , ”
166965	166968	166962	166962	I	5148	“ Never . ”
166976	166988	166962	166962	I	5148	“ And for you I ’m willing to get doubly clean . ”
166989	166992	166993	166993	I	5148	“ Tempting , ”
167024	167051	166993	166993	I	5148	“ But do n’t you have work to do ? Things to merge ? Cutting - edge technology to acquire ? Perhaps a galaxy to purchase ? ”
167089	167104	167077	167077	I	5148	“ I did that last week . Apparently there ’s nothing left to buy . ”
167105	167109	167110	167110	I	5148	“ Poor you . ”
167132	167143	167124	167124	he	2362	“ Just like Alexander . No worlds left to conquer . ”
167161	167174	167144	167144	He	2362	“ I assure you that I am very content with my conquests . ”
167187	167207	167144	167144	He	2362	“ Although you are right . I have a day full of meetings in Palm Springs starting at eight . ”
167213	167236	167208	167208	I	5148	“ And you were offering me a shower ? What would you have done if I ’d taken you up on that ? ”
167237	167250	167144	167144	He	2362	“ I would have enjoyed myself very much , I assure you . ”
167251	167259	167208	167208	I	5148	“ And been late for the meeting . ”
167260	167284	167144	167144	He	2362	“ I ’m rather confident they ca n’t start without me . That is not , however , an excuse to be late . ”
167303	167307	167294	167294	my	5148	“ What is — ”
167308	167312	167313	167313	Damien	5148	“ My ride , ”
167356	167359	167360	167360	I	5148	“ What ? ”
167363	167372	167360	167360	I	5148	“ You could n’t afford a proper helipad ? ”
167373	167400	167313	167313	Damien	5148	“ On the contrary , you ’re looking at a state - of - the - art , eco - friendly , reinforced turf landing platform . ”
167406	167409	167401	167401	I	5148	“ Seriously ? ”
167410	167488	167360	167360	I	5148	“ It ’s quite revolutionary , I assure you . The ground is prepped with a high - tensile - strength mesh system that creates an anchored root system providing a surface area with remarkable load - bearing capacity . And because the Malibu hills are prone to mudslides , I ’ve taken additional precautions and strengthened the area with a buried grid system into which that root area blends . The result is pretty damned impressive . ”
167489	167497	167401	167401	I	5148	“ If you do say so yourself . ”
167501	167534	167498	167498	He	5148	“ I ’m afraid this is n’t one of my projects . Not yet , anyway . I ’ve begun talks with the company that holds the patent on the mesh technology . ”
167535	167541	167360	167360	I	5148	“ To acquire the company ? ”
167542	167555	167556	167556	He	5148	“ Perhaps . Or maybe I ’ll simply be a silent partner . ”
167564	167578	167556	167556	He	5148	“ Not all of my business ventures involve my fingers in the pie . ”
167651	167663	167647	167647	he	5148	“ You ’re ready , Nikki . You can do this . ”
167664	167681	167682	167682	I	5148	“ Surprisingly , I think I ’m a better judge of my ability than you are , ”
167691	167736	167647	167647	he	5148	“ Willingness , yes . Ability , no . That ’s a much more objective criterion , and I see more clearly than you do . You ’re too close to the subject in question . Let ’s examine the evidence , shall we ? ”
167754	167850	167750	167750	he	5148	“ You already have two reasonably profitable smartphone apps on the market , fully designed , marketed , and supported by you and you alone . You accomplished that entrepreneurial feat when you were still in college , so that in and of itself indicates the kind of self - sufficiency a successful business owner needs . Your degrees in electrical engineering and computer science are only icing on the cake , but your invitation into PhD programs at both MIT and CalTech demonstrate that I ’m not the only one who sees your worth . ”
167851	167859	167937	167937	he	2370	“ But I turned down the programs . ”
167860	167874	167750	167750	he	5148	“ So that you could work in the real world and gain experience . ”
167909	167929	167898	167898	I	5148	“ Your car pool ’s here , Mr. Stark . You do n’t want to be late for homeroom . ”
167979	167985	167986	167986	I	5148	“ What was that for ? ”
167993	168002	168003	168003	he	2370	“ A reminder that I believe in you , ”
168006	168009	168010	168010	His	2370	“ Oh . ”
168032	168041	168042	168042	he	2370	“ And a promise of things to come , ”
168052	168072	168042	168042	he	2370	“ I ’ll call you when I get back . I ’m not sure how late I ’ll be . ”
168073	168084	168085	168085	I	5148	“ The helicopter ’s not as speedy as it looks ? ”
168088	168104	168042	168042	he	2370	“ More like my colleagues do n’t conduct business as expediently as I ’d like . ”
168105	168129	168130	168130	I	5148	“ No prob . I should have dinner with Jamie tonight , anyway . I ’ve been a best friend in absentia lately . ”
168143	168146	168130	168130	I	5148	“ What ? ”
168147	168155	168156	168156	His	2370	“ I do n’t want to go . ”
168183	168204	168214	168214	he	2370	“ But if you do n’t , then how can I spend the day looking forward to having you back ? ”
168205	168213	168214	168214	he	2370	“ You ’re a very wise woman , ”
168226	168230	168214	168214	he	2370	“ Until tonight . ”
168255	168259	168232	168232	Edward	366	“ New car ? ”
168260	168265	168266	168266	Edward	366	“ No , ma’am , ”
168269	168279	168266	168266	Edward	366	“ Mr. Stark rebuilt her about three years ago . ”
168280	168283	168284	168284	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
168432	168457	168421	168421	He	366	“ We normally reserve the Bentley for formal occasions , but Mr. Stark thought you might enjoy arriving at your new position in style . ”
168505	168526	168527	168527	I	5148	“ I need to go home , actually . Not work . But Mr. Stark was right about the rest , ”
168538	168548	168530	168530	I	5148	“ I ’m definitely going to enjoy this ride . ”
168549	168569	168527	168527	I	5148	“ I ’m afraid Mr. Stark was very clear that I am to see you safely to your office . ”
168570	168574	168575	168575	I	5148	“ Was he ? ”
168606	168609	168598	168598	I	5148	“ Fine , ”
168619	168629	168610	168610	I	5148	“ But I do have to go home first . ”
168630	168637	168638	168638	He	5148	“ Of course , Ms. Fairchild . ”
168753	168760	168761	168761	I	5148	“ What year is the car ? ”
168772	168780	168781	168781	he	366	“ It ’s a 1960 S2 Saloon , ”
168784	168826	168781	168781	he	366	“ Only 388 were produced , and I ’m afraid there are very few still on the road . When Mr. Stark ran across this one in a junkyard , he was determined to bring it back to its former glory . ”
168896	168913	168875	168875	I	5148	“ You do n’t happen to have a paper and pen up there , do you ? ”
168914	168917	168918	168918	Edward	366	“ Certainly , ”
169389	169408	169378	169378	I	5148	“ I need to shower and change and grab a few things . I might be a while . ”
169409	169417	169418	169418	he	366	“ That wo n’t be a problem , ”
169826	169829	169830	169830	I	5148	“ James ? ”
170638	170655	170629	170629	Jamie	1450	“ Oh , fuck a duck ! Nikki ! I just killed your favorite coffee mug ! ”
170656	170662	170663	170663	I	5148	“ I ’m right here , ”
170727	170730	170731	170731	she	1450	“ Sorry , ”
170734	170739	170740	170740	I	5148	“ It ’s okay . ”
170756	170765	170766	170766	she	1450	“ It was a ridiculous favorite , anyway , ”
170780	170788	170766	170766	she	1450	“ You do n’t even like football . ”
170789	170794	170795	170795	I	5148	“ It was big , ”
170798	170820	170795	170795	I	5148	“ It could hold hot chocolate and marshmallows without the chocolate dribbling over the side when you stick a spoon in . ”
170821	170846	170766	170766	she	1450	“ Yeah , but what ’s the point of drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows if you ’re going to be all prissy about it ? ”
170900	170903	170904	170904	she	1450	“ Thanks , ”
170919	170922	170923	170923	She	1450	“ Okay . ”
170926	170929	170923	170923	She	1450	“ Fine . ”
170957	170962	170963	170963	I	5148	“ I was worried , ”
170966	170973	170963	170963	I	5148	“ Did you sleep somewhere else ? ”
170974	170978	170979	170979	She	1450	“ Shit no . ”
171010	171025	171026	171026	Her	1450	“ I may have stayed out all night , but I did n’t sleep . ”
171037	171082	171031	171031	she	1450	“ And you ? Because it seems to me your bed ’s not getting all that much action lately . Pretty soon you ’re going to have to sign the poor thing up for therapy . Loneliness can lead to depression , you know . ”
171083	171091	171092	171092	I	5148	“ I ’ll get right on that , ”
171096	171113	171092	171092	I	5148	“ And as a matter of fact , no . I was n’t here , either . ”
171114	171119	171031	171031	she	1450	“ Uh - huh . ”
171128	171136	171137	171137	I	5148	“ I did n’t say a word , ”
171141	171188	171137	171137	I	5148	“ But if I were going to say something , it would only be that when I stay out all night it ’s with the same guy . You have so many different men you should start a Facebook page just to keep track of them . ”
171189	171208	171031	171031	she	1450	“ Not a bad plan , actually . Except that I think this guy might be something special . ”
171212	171215	171209	171209	I	5148	“ Seriously ? ”
171216	171258	171317	171317	She	2425	“ Totally . He ’s not as fuckalicious as Damien - king - of - the - world - Stark , but I would n’t run screaming from a repeat performance . Or even a triple play , for that matter . ”
171286	171316	171277	171277	I	5148	“ You ca n’t just drop a bomb like that on me when I ’m running late . So come on . We can talk while I get dressed . ”
171511	171514	171515	171515	she	646	“ Raine , ”
171551	171555	171556	171556	she	646	“ Bryan Raine , ”
171598	171605	171584	171584	she	646	“ My guy is Bryan Raine . ”
171716	171721	171722	171722	Jamie	1450	“ That ’s him , ”
171726	171738	171722	171722	Jamie	1450	“ That ’s the guy you were out with last night ? ”
171739	171742	171743	171743	She	646	“ Yup . ”
171747	171762	171743	171743	She	646	“ Though we stayed in most of the time . Pretty hot , huh ? ”
171763	171768	171769	171769	I	5148	“ He ’s incredible , ”
172035	172044	172045	172045	I	5148	“ Do n’t get drool on my keyboard , ”
172048	172056	172045	172045	I	5148	“ So how did you meet him ? ”
172057	172065	172066	172066	she	646	“ He ’s my co - star , ”
172080	172111	172066	172066	she	646	“ He mostly models , but he ’s also done a few television guest appearances and he was even one of the bad guys in the last James Bond movie . ”
172112	172116	172117	172117	I	5148	“ He was ? ”
172131	172144	172145	172145	she	646	“ Well , he stood around with a gun and looked hot , ”
172148	172158	172145	172145	she	646	“ But he was on the bad guy team . ”
172159	172170	172171	172171	I	5148	“ But you guys have n’t started to shoot yet , ”
172180	172193	172194	172194	I	5148	“ So why did you go out with him ? Which one ? ”
172206	172241	172171	172171	I	5148	“ The blue . And he called me . He said that since the commercial ’s basically a love story in thirty seconds , we ought to go out and suss out our chemistry . ”
172242	172251	172194	172194	I	5148	“ I take it the chemistry is good ? ”
172252	172255	172256	172256	Jamie	1450	“ Sizzling , ”
172437	172442	172425	172425	I	5148	“ What is it ? ”
172443	172469	172421	172421	she	2437	“ You ’re really wearing a skirt ? I thought you tech folks were all about the jeans and T - shirts with math equations . ”
172488	172516	172474	172474	I	5148	“ First day on the job , and I ’m not doing the tech side , remember . I ’m management . I want to look professional . ”
172624	172634	172637	172637	her	2444	“ I want to hear more about this guy , ”
172652	172660	172661	172661	She	2444	“ But I have to get going . ”
172706	172712	172690	172690	I	5148	“ Do I look okay ? ”
172713	172719	172720	172720	she	2444	“ When do n’t you ? ”
172723	172745	172720	172720	she	2444	“ And if anyone asks , Lauren Graham wore that jacket on Gilmore Girls . Trust me , it ’s cool . ”
172755	172789	172746	172746	I	5148	“ Want to meet after work ? I ’ll tell you about Raine and you can tell me all about your nights away from home , too . I want to hear everything . ”
172790	172794	172795	172795	I	5148	“ Sounds good , ”
172820	172823	172814	172814	I	5148	“ everything . ”
172824	172830	172831	172831	I	5148	“ Du - par ’s ? ”
172834	172850	172851	172851	she	2444	“ Are you shitting me ? I want a drink . Meet me at Firefly , ”
172872	172883	172884	172884	I	5148	“ I ’ll text you as I ’m leaving work , ”
172894	172911	172884	172884	I	5148	“ I ’m really glad about this guy . I ca n’t wait to hear more . ”
172912	172921	172922	172922	she	2444	“ I ca n’t wait to see more , ”
172929	172942	172922	172922	she	2444	“ Trust me , I could look at that man all day . ”
173319	173324	173325	173325	I	5148	“ I ’m imagining , ”
173333	173344	173345	173345	He	2460	“ What the hell do you think you ’re doing ? ”
173373	173378	173379	173379	I	5148	“ Going to work , ”
173382	173394	173379	173379	I	5148	“ I ’m supposed to be in a meeting right now . ”
173395	173402	173366	173366	he	2460	“ So why are n’t you ? ”
173403	173408	173379	173379	I	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki — ”
173409	173412	173413	173413	I	5148	“ No , ”
173416	173485	173413	173413	I	5148	“ I ’m the only one who gets to say that . Dammit , Damien , I am perfectly capable of driving myself . And if you want to hire out Edward then ask me . It ’s easy . You walk up to me and say , ‘ Nikki , darling , light of my life , can I have my driver take you to work ? ’ ”
173499	173507	173492	173492	I	5148	“ And you would have said yes ? ”
173508	173511	173512	173512	I	5148	“ No , ”
173515	173545	173512	173512	I	5148	“ But that ’s the way you should have handled it . It ’s my job , Damien . I want to drive myself . I will drive myself . ”
173546	173561	173492	173492	I	5148	“ I do n’t want you around the paparazzi without someone there with you . ”
173591	173596	173597	173597	I	5148	“ Nobody ’s here , ”
173600	173607	173512	173512	I	5148	“ But there could have been . ”
173608	173617	173618	173618	I	5148	“ And I would have dealt with it , ”
173630	173679	173625	173625	I	5148	“ You ca n’t be with me every second of every day . No matter how much I wish you could . I ’m going to see them when I ’m alone . It ’s going to happen , and we both just have to deal with it . ”
173685	173692	173682	173682	him	2464	“ I do n’t like it . ”
173693	173698	173625	173625	I	5148	“ Me , neither . ”
173699	173704	173682	173682	him	2464	“ Dammit , Nikki . ”
173722	173730	173731	173731	he	2464	“ I ’m going to my meeting , ”
173746	173751	173752	173752	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
173755	173760	173752	173752	I	5148	“ And , Damien ? ”
173761	173764	173736	173736	he	2464	“ Yes ? ”
173765	173775	173752	173752	I	5148	“ Thank you . Right emotion . Crappy execution . ”
173784	173795	173796	173796	he	2464	“ We ’ll have to agree to disagree on that , ”
173799	173812	173796	173796	he	2464	“ It is not an argument I can have from Palm Springs . ”
174013	174030	174003	174003	I	5148	“ Well , look at you , Texas . All dressed up with someplace to go . ”
174119	174128	174129	174129	she	5962	“ I knew today was your first day , ”
174132	174147	174129	174129	she	5962	“ but I did n’t think I ’d get lucky enough to see you . ”
174201	174210	174211	174211	I	5148	“ What on earth are you doing here ? ”
174247	174255	174283	174283	She	5962	“ Same thing you are , Texas . ”
174263	174282	174256	174256	I	5148	“ You ’re going into the tech industry ? Designing an iPhone app to feature Blaine ’s work ? ”
174292	174326	174283	174283	She	5962	“ Not a bad idea , actually , and I just may have to wrangle some advice out of you about that later . But no . I ’m here to see Bruce . ”
174327	174330	174283	174283	She	5962	“ Why ? ”
174359	174367	174368	174368	she	5962	“ I need one of his keys , ”
174378	174435	174368	174368	she	5962	“ But do n’t worry . It ’s not for a tryst . Blaine ’s more than I can handle in that department — and now he ’s decided he wants to touch up some of the paintings for Saturday ’s showing , but apparently they ’re in the gallery ’s off - site storage facility . ”
174442	174450	174451	174451	Giselle	2551	“ Ca n’t Giselle let you in ? ”
174508	174584	174690	174690	She	5962	“ If she had n’t hauled her ass to Palm Springs , sure . But she called me from the road . Apparently she ’s on her way to get a few pieces from her gallery there , and her assistant does n’t have the spare key to the unit . Why the hell Giselle gave it to Bruce instead of her assistant , I do n’t know . Sometimes , that woman baffles me . ”
174585	174600	174690	174690	She	5962	“ Damien ’s in Palm Springs , too . He went there this morning . ”
174601	174630	174631	174631	Evelyn	5962	“ Too bad Giselle did n’t know . She could have dumped the job of bringing the paintings back on him . Would have saved me a trip . ”
174636	174671	174631	174631	Evelyn	5962	“ Frankly , I would have much rather gone to Palm Springs than Burbank , and I ’m sure she knows it , but I think she and Brucey boy are having another tiff . ”
174672	174678	174690	174690	She	5962	“ Why are they fighting ? ”
174679	174689	174690	174690	She	5962	“ With those two ? Who the hell knows . ”
174810	174816	174817	174817	Evelyn	5962	“ And what about you ? ”
174820	174870	174817	174817	Evelyn	5962	“ I keep hoping you and that camera of yours will take me up on my offer so that I can ply you with drink and wrangle some gossip , but I guess you do n’t need me now that you ’ve got Damien ’s view at your disposal . ”
174871	174880	174881	174881	I	5148	“ It is one hell of a view , ”
174884	174895	174881	174881	I	5148	“ But I ’d still love to come over sometime . ”
174896	174906	174907	174907	she	5962	“ Anytime . Bring your camera if you want , ”
174910	174950	174907	174907	she	5962	“ Or just come for the liquor and the gossip . Both flow free at my house . Advice , too , if you need it . But from what I ’m hearing , you ’re doing just fine . ”
174951	174960	174961	174961	I	5148	“ Blaine ’s been telling stories on me . ”
175016	175043	174992	174992	she	5962	“ Hell , yes . What ’s the point of sending that boy out in the world if he does n’t bring me back the dirt ? ”
175044	175047	174992	174992	she	5962	“ And ? ”
175048	175056	175057	175057	she	5962	“ You ’re boringly dirt - free , ”
175060	175072	175057	175057	she	5962	“ From what I hear , you ’re swimming in bliss . ”
175076	175083	175073	175073	I	5148	“ I ’ll go with that . ”
175084	175099	174992	174992	she	5962	“ Good . Glad I ’m not the only one getting hot sex regularly . ”
175118	175145	175146	175146	I	5148	“ But it ’s more than that , I take it ? From what Blaine says , it sounds like you ’ve tamed the savage beast . ”
175168	175179	175159	175159	I	5148	“ So there ’s no new dramas on the horizon ? ”
175180	175183	175184	175184	I	5148	“ No , ”
175222	175232	175211	175211	I	5148	“ Why ? Is there something I should know ? ”
175242	175247	175233	175233	She	5962	“ Not a thing . ”
175284	175311	175275	175275	She	5962	“ Aw , hell , Texas . I meant what I said . There ’s nothing you need to worry about . Not now , anyway . ”
175339	175348	175349	175349	Evelyn	5962	“ Time to go to work , right ? ”
175352	175361	175362	175362	I	5148	“ You are not getting off that easy , ”
175416	175428	175429	175429	she	5962	“ Wow , it ’s so cool to have you here , ”
175437	175457	175429	175429	she	5962	“ I mean , you ’re going to fit in great . We can do lunch if you want . ”
175458	175461	175462	175462	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
175477	175488	175462	175462	I	5148	“ I think I ’m having lunch with Bruce today . ”
175489	175512	175513	175513	She	5962	“ Oh , right . Mr. Tolley ’s ready for you . Just a sec , and I ’ll walk you back . ”
175538	175544	175513	175513	She	5962	“ May I help you ? ”
175545	175549	175550	175550	Evelyn	5962	“ Evelyn Dodge , ”
175553	175561	175550	175550	Evelyn	5962	“ I called Bruce about picking up — ”
175562	175571	175572	175572	She	5962	“ Oh , sure thing , Ms. Dodge . ”
175602	175612	175588	175588	Evelyn	5962	“ We ’ll see each other tomorrow , Texas . ”
175613	175616	175617	175617	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
175640	175651	175621	175621	Evelyn	5962	“ You ’ll certainly be seeing plenty of me tomorrow . ”
175720	175728	175715	175715	he	2092	“ Nikki , great to see you . ”
175823	175831	175832	175832	I	5148	“ If this is a bad time , ”
175835	175849	175832	175832	I	5148	“ I mean , I ’m pretty sure Human Resources is expecting me . ”
175850	175880	175881	175881	He	2092	“ I talked with Trish . She ’ll take care of your paperwork this afternoon . Right now , I ’ve got something I ’d like you to handle . ”
175904	175917	175881	175881	He	2092	“ I hope you do n’t mind getting thrown to the wolves . ”
175957	175967	175953	175955	your new boss	2508	“ Not at all . What ’s going on ? ”
175968	176057	175953	175955	your new boss	2508	“ Calendaring screw up and I ’m double - booked . I need you and Tanner to head downtown to meet with the IT team at Suncoast Bank . They ’re interested in the 128 - bit encryption algorithm we ’ve been beta testing . You ’ll be stepping in to head up marketing on the product anyway , but I had hoped to give you a little time in - house to get your feet wet . Sorry to bring all this down on your first day . ”
176058	176063	176064	176064	I	5148	“ Not a problem , ”
176160	176170	176171	176171	Bruce	2092	“ It should n’t be too hard a sell , ”
176174	176223	176171	176171	Bruce	2092	“ The product is exactly what they need , but we ’re going to want to put our own team on - site to make sure their IT group gets trained properly and that we have eyes on and a fast response to every bug and every glitch . ”
176224	176228	176242	176242	he	2092	“ Of course . ”
176229	176241	176242	176242	he	2092	“ That ’s why I ’m sending Tanner in , too , ”
176254	176286	176242	176242	he	2092	“ He worked on the development of the project and , frankly , I think it would be good for him to work six months in - house with a client . ”
176287	176290	176242	176242	he	2092	“ Why ? ”
176294	176339	176291	176291	Bruce	2092	“ If you do n’t mind mixing business with pleasure , we can go into that when I see you tomorrow . Right now , I ’ll just say that when I was talking about the wolves , I did n’t mean the client . ”
176340	176343	176344	176344	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
176418	176428	176429	176429	Bruce	2092	“ I said ‘ come in , ’ already . ”
176509	176512	176513	176513	he	2092	“ Bruce ! ”
176523	176555	176513	176513	he	2092	“ Just got off the phone with Phil . He ’s sending up the information on the Continental Mortgage proposal . I ’ll make sure he stays on top of it . ”
176556	176560	176561	176561	Bruce	2092	“ Sounds good , ”
176576	176583	176561	176561	Bruce	2092	“ Tanner , this is Nikki . ”
176636	176646	176647	176647	Tanner	457	“ We ’ve all heard a lot about you , ”
176650	176663	176664	176664	He	457	“ Everyone ’s been eager to meet the flavor of the month . ”
176675	176683	176664	176664	He	457	“ So welcome aboard and all that . ”
176697	176707	176708	176708	I	5148	“ I ’ll try to live up to expectations . ”
176733	176741	176722	176722	I	5148	“ what I really want is world peace ”
176747	176754	176755	176755	Bruce	2092	“ I ’m sure you will , ”
176758	176768	176755	176755	Bruce	2092	“ We ’re thrilled you ’ve joined the team . ”
176795	176802	176803	176803	Tanner	457	“ We really should get going , ”
176825	176828	176829	176829	Bruce	2092	“ Here . ”
176841	176853	176829	176829	Bruce	2092	“ You can bone up on the specs during the drive . ”
177216	177223	177224	177224	I	5148	“ Do you have a problem ? ”
177287	177290	177291	177291	he	5148	“ Yeah , ”
177294	177300	177291	177291	he	5148	“ You ’re my problem . ”
177321	177329	177291	177291	he	5148	“ Me ? You mean working together ? ”
177330	177343	177291	177291	he	5148	“ Working together ? Together ? Is that what you call it ? ”
177344	177351	177352	177352	I	5148	“ At the moment , no , ”
177355	177366	177352	177352	I	5148	“ I do n’t think this is working at all . ”
177367	177374	177375	177375	he	5148	“ We ’re not working together , ”
177385	177393	177375	177375	he	5148	“ You ’re my fucking boss now . ”
177394	177397	177398	177398	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
177401	177418	177398	177398	I	5148	“ I am . And I suggest you think before you talk to me like that . ”
177430	177498	177375	177375	he	5148	“ This was supposed to be my job . I worked this encryption package since day one . I know it inside and out . And I ’ve proven to Bruce over and over again that I can head up a team . Then what happens ? Some privileged little bitch decides she wants to work for pin money , and suddenly I ’m booted back downstairs . ”
177499	177503	177504	177504	I	5148	“ Pin money ? ”
177507	177515	177504	177504	I	5148	“ What century are you living in ? ”
177516	177578	177375	177375	he	5148	“ What ’s the matter ? Get bored with spending your boyfriend ’s money ? Thought you ’d come here and shake things up ? Do you know how many calls Cindy ’s had to field ? Dozens of calls from reporters who just want to know if you really work here . It ’s a fucking waste of her time . ”
177641	177646	177638	177638	Tanner	457	“ flavor of the month ”
177652	177662	177663	177663	he	457	“ And you know what really chaps my ass ? ”
177674	177692	177663	177663	he	457	“ The fact that you ’re here just because the boss wants to make his wife happy . ”
177746	177784	177785	177785	I	5148	“ This job requires a certain amount of finesse . An ability to communicate with clients and the public . And most of all a talent for smiling at people that you ’d much rather spit on . ”
177795	177798	177799	177799	I	5148	“ Tanner , ”
177802	177813	177799	177799	I	5148	“ I do n’t think this position is for you . ”
178068	178082	178095	178095	I	5148	“ Is it true that Stark is looking to take over Innovative Resources ? ”
178083	178094	178095	178095	I	5148	“ Nikki , what exactly is your role at IR ? ”
178130	178140	178106	178106	Nikki	5143	“ Are you reporting back to Stark ’s company ? ”
178141	178153	178111	178111	I	5148	“ What do you say to the allegations of corporate espionage ? ”
178207	178222	178240	178240	I	5148	“ Is this a ploy to up your value to reality - show producers ? ”
178223	178239	178240	178240	I	5148	“ Tell us about the real Nikki — is it true your sister committed suicide ? ”
178359	178363	178364	178364	I	5148	“ No comment , ”
178399	178405	178406	178406	I	5148	“ Hurry up , Tanner , ”
178417	178426	178409	178409	I	5148	“ We need to get to a meeting . ”
178427	178447	178448	178448	Jamie	1450	“ Oh , my God ! I ca n’t believe you got paired to work with such a twit ! ”
178485	178500	178501	178501	she	2092	“ It ’s like you ’re living a sitcom . No , a movie , ”
178504	178525	178501	178501	she	2092	“ One of those screwball comedies where the spunky heroine is paired with the completely incompetent idiot and wackiness ensues . ”
178526	178550	178467	178467	She	2092	“ Except he ’s vengeful , not incompetent . And does n’t the heroine in those movies always end up with the idiot ? ”
178551	178555	178556	178556	Jamie	1450	“ Not necessarily , ”
178565	178581	178582	178582	She	2092	“ Not so long as there ’s another love interest in the B - story . ”
178590	178603	178582	178582	She	2092	“ A Day with Tanner . I can practically see the trailer . ”
178607	178626	178604	178604	I	5148	“ Well , you can star in it . Personally , I ’d rather have another leading man . ”
178627	178631	178632	178632	Jamie	1450	“ You do , ”
178635	178695	178632	178632	Jamie	1450	“ And as much as it pains me not to talk about either of our fuckalicious men , I want to hear the rest of this story first . How did the camera - vultures know you were there ? Did Tanner tell them ? Have you told Damien about the corporate espionage comment ? Was he totally livid ? ”
178696	178708	178709	178709	I	5148	“ I ’m going to tell him when I see him , ”
178712	178721	178709	178709	I	5148	“ And yeah , he ’ll be livid . ”
178763	178768	178769	178769	I	5148	“ As for Tanner … ”
178790	178802	178803	178803	I	5148	“ Does n’t matter much . They know now . Yay , ”
178823	178834	178807	178807	Jamie	1450	“ Are you okay ? I mean , really okay ? ”
178956	178964	178952	178952	I	5148	“ keep that nasty cellulite at bay . ”
179207	179210	179211	179211	I	5148	“ No , ”
179221	179268	179211	179211	I	5148	“ I ’m not okay . But I was — before they brought up Ashley , I was dealing with it . I did n’t like it , but I was coping . And I ’ll be okay again . I just was n’t prepared today . ”
179269	179291	179211	179211	I	5148	“ It will pass , you know . That ’s the good and the bad about publicity . It goes away . ”
179292	179306	179307	179307	I	5148	“ And like Tanner said , I ’m the flavor of the month . ”
179317	179338	179307	179307	I	5148	“ Maybe next month they ’ll leave me alone and focus on the rising starlet who ’s dating Byron Rand . ”
179339	179343	179344	179344	she	1450	“ Bryan Raine , ”
179347	179380	179344	179344	she	1450	“ And do n’t even try to change the subject . So come on — forget the stupid paparazzi . I want to hear the rest of what happened at the meeting . ”
179381	179384	179385	179385	I	5148	“ Right , ”
179420	179426	179427	179427	Tanner	457	“ I ’ll field that , ”
179441	179456	179427	179427	Tanner	457	“ Ms. Fairchild is coming at this from a purely administrative point of view . ”
179457	179462	179463	179463	Jamie	1450	“ The little prick , ”
179475	179481	179482	179482	I	5148	“ No argument from me , ”
179485	179525	179482	179482	I	5148	“ But I probably should have said nothing . I mean , the whole idea was to get the client to take the product and the team . That would get Tanner out of my hair for six months . ”
179526	179533	179427	179427	Tanner	457	“ So what did you do ? ”
179534	179608	179482	179482	I	5148	“ When he finished , I just casually pointed out that while Tanner ’s overview was entirely accurate , he left out some key information . Then I spent the next fifteen minutes running through ways to tweak the algorithm to give them a huge variety of options . I mean , conceptually , the program is brilliant , but when you get down to the actual coding , then all you really — ”
179609	179612	179613	179613	Jamie	1450	“ Okay , ”
179620	179639	179613	179613	Jamie	1450	“ I get the idea . Techie stuff . You impressed them . Tanner looked like a doofus . ”
179640	179647	179648	179648	I	5148	“ So sweet and so true , ”
179651	179679	179648	179648	I	5148	“ But the beauty is that he did n’t look like an ignorant doofus . He knows his stuff . He just left out some important details . ”
179680	179700	179701	179701	Jamie	1450	“ Which is good , because they would n’t want some bonehead moving in - house for six months , ”
179704	179729	179648	179648	I	5148	“ Exactly . I think I ’d have to quit if Tanner were working down the hall from me . The guy ’s toxic . ”
179730	179741	179742	179742	Jamie	1450	“ Well , we would n’t want you to quit , ”
179749	179771	179742	179742	Jamie	1450	“ How on earth would you live ? A million dollars just does n’t go as far as it used to . ”
179805	179813	179814	179814	she	1450	“ You have no sense of adventure , ”
179840	179849	179850	179850	she	1450	“ So when do you get the money ? ”
179853	179870	179880	179880	I	5148	“ It ’s already mine . But I need to tell Damien where to transfer it . ”
179871	179876	179877	179877	Jamie	1450	“ Uh , yeah , ”
179976	179984	179985	179985	I	5148	“ I ’ve been talking with brokers , ”
180027	180034	180035	180035	I	5148	“ And enough about the money , ”
180051	180063	180046	180046	I	5148	“ To you . Today a commercial , tomorrow an Oscar . ”
180064	180071	180035	180035	I	5148	“ I ’ll drink to that . ”
180072	180079	180046	180046	I	5148	“ You ’ll drink to anything . ”
180080	180083	180084	180084	she	646	“ True , ”
180094	180101	180102	180102	she	646	“ Would you have believed it ? ”
180113	180117	180105	180105	I	5148	“ Believe what ? ”
180118	180185	180110	180110	she	646	“ When we were in high school and you were doing all those damned Miss Corner Gas Station pageants and I was auditioning for community theater . Would you have believed we ’d be in Los Angeles and I ’d have a commercial and you ’d be on the cusp of starting your own business ? Not to mention lassoing the town ’s most eligible bachelor . ”
180186	180189	180190	180190	I	5148	“ No , ”
180193	180201	180190	180190	I	5148	“ I never would have believed it . ”
180202	180211	180212	180212	Jamie	1450	“ So this is for both of us , ”
180232	180252	180228	180228	I	5148	“ For two Texas girls who moved to LA on their own , we ’re not doing half bad . ”
180285	180291	180292	180292	Jamie	1450	“ Face it , Nik , ”
180295	180305	180292	180292	Jamie	1450	“ You ca n’t do LA in this car . ”
180369	180382	180383	180383	I	5148	“ I ’ll take her in for a tune - up soon , ”
180386	180401	180383	180383	I	5148	“ It ’s probably just something like spark plugs or a gunked up carburetor . ”
180402	180412	180354	180354	she	646	“ Do you even know what a carburetor is ? ”
180413	180416	180417	180417	I	5148	“ No , ”
180420	180427	180417	180417	I	5148	“ But presumably the mechanic does . ”
180428	180499	180354	180354	she	646	“ Open your eyes and observe the reality , Nik . She ’s been a great little car , but she ’s going to stall out on the highway one day , and you ’re going to be the lead story on the eleven o’clock news . ‘ Billionaire ’s girlfriend squashed like a bug in fifteen - car pileup . ’ Do n’t say I did n’t warn you . ”
180521	180528	180529	180529	Jamie	1450	“ Speaking of the billionaire boyfriend , ”
180532	180552	180529	180529	Jamie	1450	“ who all ’s coming to the party tomorrow ? I ’ll finally get to meet Evelyn , right ? ”
180553	180558	180559	180559	I	5148	“ Oh , yeah , ”
180562	180595	180559	180559	I	5148	“ And Blaine , of course . And you and me . We ’re the only ones who know it ’s me on that wall , so we ’re keeping it intimate — ”
180611	180618	180619	180619	I	5148	“ We ’re keeping it small , ”
180623	180647	180619	180619	I	5148	“ until eight . That ’s when the regular guests arrive to see all of Blaine ’s paintings and do the mingling thing . ”
180648	180654	180655	180655	She	1450	“ Cool . And Ollie ? ”
180702	180708	180709	180709	I	5148	“ He ’s not coming , ”
180712	180719	180720	180720	she	1450	“ Not for the first part , ”
180723	180734	180735	180735	She	1450	“ I know you never told him about the painting . ”
180740	180744	180735	180735	She	1450	“ Did you ? ”
180745	180748	180749	180749	I	5148	“ No , ”
180753	180778	180749	180749	I	5148	“ I was wondering if he was coming to the rest of it . The showing , or whatever you want to call it . ”
180779	180789	180790	180790	I	5148	“ I ’m still calling it a cocktail party , ”
180803	180820	180821	180821	I	5148	“ And no , he ’s not coming . I think he and Courtney have plans , ”
181107	181111	181112	181112	Jamie	1450	“ Holy fuck , ”
181304	181320	181294	181294	Jamie	1450	“ How did you get so lucky ? The guy is seriously swoon - worthy . ”
181321	181324	181325	181325	I	5148	“ Totally , ”
181426	181432	181417	181417	I	5148	“ What do you think ? ”
181433	181448	181449	181449	she	1415	“ I think you ’re going to look hotter than sin in that dress , ”
181452	181470	181449	181449	she	1415	“ Can I raid your closet ? I ’m bored out of my mind with my clothes . ”
181471	181506	181417	181417	I	5148	“ Jamie , you ’re a size four . I have n’t been that small since I escaped from Mother and learned about the existence of that mysterious substance I like to call food . ”
181516	181524	181507	181507	She	1415	“ I need my own billionaire boyfriend . ”
181525	181531	181532	181532	I	5148	“ I do n’t disagree , ”
181535	181544	181532	181532	I	5148	“ I find him a highly desirable accessory . ”
181545	181550	181551	181551	Jamie	1450	“ Wanna go shopping ? ”
181554	181563	181551	181551	Jamie	1450	“ I ’m serious about my wardrobe crisis . ”
181576	181579	181580	181580	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
181583	181618	181580	181580	I	5148	“ But give me a sec to change and feed the cat . And can we get some real dinner while we ’re out ? Vodka is n’t one of the major food groups . ”
181619	181624	181625	181625	Jamie	1450	“ It ’s not ? ”
181710	181719	181705	181705	Jamie	1450	“ How ’d he get in the apartment ? ”
181720	181724	181725	181725	I	5148	“ Beats me , ”
181995	182002	182003	182003	I	5148	“ It does n’t belong here , ”
182016	182020	182003	182003	I	5148	“ The bed ? ”
182021	182035	182036	182036	I	5148	“ It ’s supposed to be at the Malibu house . Not here , ”
182039	182047	182036	182036	I	5148	“ It feels like an ending somehow . ”
182105	182112	182113	182113	she	1450	“ Oh , shit , Nik , ”
182117	182122	182113	182113	she	1450	“ Do n’t even . ”
182123	182126	182099	182099	she	1450	“ What ? ”
182127	182157	182113	182113	she	1450	“ Do n’t go all Psych 101 on me . You ’re looking for all sorts of meanings that are n’t there . You do this all the time . ”
182158	182163	182099	182099	she	1450	“ I do not . ”
182164	182180	182113	182113	she	1450	“ Well , maybe not all the time , but you did it with Milo . ”
182181	182190	182099	182099	she	1450	“ That was freshman year of high school . ”
182191	182204	182205	182205	she	1450	“ So maybe ‘ all the time ’ was a tiny exaggeration , ”
182208	182227	182228	182228	I	5148	“ My point is that you had a crush on him and he was a senior , remember ? ”
182237	182253	182228	182228	I	5148	“ And it was cold one day , and he lent you his letter jacket . ”
182254	182269	182099	182099	she	1450	“ And we spent a week trying to analyze what his underlying motivation was . ”
182277	182295	182099	182099	she	1450	“ Turns out he was motivated by the fact that you were cold and he was nice . ”
182296	182301	182228	182228	I	5148	“ And your point ? ”
182302	182309	182310	182310	she	1450	“ Do you like the bed ? ”
182313	182318	182319	182319	I	5148	“ I love it , ”
182322	182330	182228	182228	I	5148	“ Does Damien know you love it ? ”
182331	182334	182228	182228	I	5148	“ Sure . ”
182335	182380	182228	182228	I	5148	“ So there you go . You like the bed . Damien likes you — understatement of the year , but there you have it . I ’m sure that when you move in , you can take the bed back there with you . ”
182381	182387	182228	182228	I	5148	“ When I move in ? ”
182396	182424	182228	182228	I	5148	“ That ’s what you want , right ? Not that I ’m trying to kick you out , but a girl ’s got ta face reality . ”
182441	182452	182427	182427	I	5148	“ It ’s too soon to even think about that . ”
182453	182465	182516	182516	she	2596	“ Shit , Nik . You want it . Own it . ”
182466	182469	182470	182470	I	5148	“ Fine , ”
182473	182507	182470	182470	I	5148	“ I want it . But leaping into things that we want is n’t always the best course of action . Sometimes , a little thought and discretion make a lot of sense . ”
182508	182515	182516	182516	she	2596	“ This is n’t about me , ”
182534	182551	182531	182531	I	5148	“ Maybe it should be . You ’re not exactly one to be giving relationship advice . ”
182552	182571	182572	182572	she	2596	“ True . But you asked . So which one of us is the idiot here ? Besides , ”
182580	182607	182572	182572	she	2596	“ maybe I ’m turning over a new leaf . Monogamy can be fun . I mean , I ca n’t imagine getting tired of Raine . ”
182613	182630	182572	182572	she	2596	“ Actually , after last night I do n’t think I can imagine Raine getting tired . ”
182645	182652	182572	182572	she	2596	“ So I keep the bed ? ”
182653	182685	182631	182631	I	5148	“ Hell , yes , you keep the bed . For that matter , keep it in the living room for a day or so . Margarita sleepover tonight after shopping ? ”
182686	182690	182572	182572	she	2596	“ With movies ? ”
182691	182695	182696	182696	she	2596	“ Nothing sappy , ”
182699	182720	182696	182696	she	2596	“ I ’m not in the mood to cry . Action . I want to see shit being blown up . ”
182911	182914	182898	182898	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
182915	182920	182870	182870	she	2596	“ Are you okay ? ”
182937	182970	182934	182935	The paparazzi	2092	“ How is it you know every little thing that happens to me ? Did you task a satellite ? Are there tiny transmitters hidden in the clothes you ’ve bought me ? ”
182971	182991	182992	182992	he	2092	“ Every person in the world with a smartphone and a social media account saw pictures of you today , ”
182995	183017	182992	182992	he	2092	“ And , frankly , I like the satellite idea . I ’ll get my aerospace division to look into that . ”
183018	183021	182934	182935	The paparazzi	2092	“ Great . ”
183022	183035	182992	182992	he	2092	“ I asked you a question , Nikki . Are you okay ? ”
183067	183074	183063	183063	I	5148	“ Yes . I ’m fine . ”
183075	183080	183081	183081	His	2092	“ They mentioned Ashley . ”
183112	183127	183128	183128	I	5148	“ I know what you ’re thinking , but it would n’t have mattered , ”
183131	183162	183128	183128	I	5148	“ No one was around the building when I arrived . They came later . Even if Edward had driven me , he would have been long gone by then . ”
183163	183171	183172	183172	he	2092	“ We ’ll talk about it later , ”
183196	183206	183207	183207	he	2092	“ Tell me about the rest of your day , ”
183210	183216	183128	183128	I	5148	“ Do I have to ? ”
183217	183221	183128	183128	I	5148	“ Not good ? ”
183227	183267	183222	183222	I	5148	“ Not bad , but I spent most of the day with this guy on my team named Tanner who turned out to be a backbiting little prick . Jamie thinks he ’s the one who called the paparazzi . ”
183268	183278	183279	183279	I	5148	“ And made a few suggestions about corporate espionage ? ”
183290	183301	183279	183279	I	5148	“ I must say you ’re a most lovely spy . ”
183302	183308	183128	183128	I	5148	“ You ’re not pissed ? ”
183309	183314	183315	183315	he	2092	“ I ’m livid , ”
183318	183341	183315	183315	he	2092	“ I do n’t take those kinds of accusations lightly . If your little prick initiated them , I ’ll find out . ”
183342	183354	183128	183128	I	5148	“ Oh . You sounded like you thought it was funny . ”
183355	183408	183315	183315	he	2092	“ The situation , no . I ’m merely anticipating the joy of decimating whoever started a rumor like that . I will stand for a lot of things , but corporate espionage is n’t one of them . And suggesting that my girlfriend is my spy makes it that much worse . ”
183488	183501	183502	183502	he	5148	“ This is not my first choice for a topic of conversation , ”
183505	183509	183510	183510	I	5148	“ Nor mine , ”
183515	183522	183510	183510	I	5148	“ Tell me about your day . ”
183523	183539	183477	183477	Damien	5148	“ I ’d rather hear what you ’re doing right now . Where are you ? ”
183540	183545	183546	183546	I	5148	“ On our bed , ”
183549	183554	183546	183546	I	5148	“ Thinking of you . ”
183555	183565	183566	183566	he	5148	“ Are you really ? I can picture you , ”
183569	183589	183566	183566	he	5148	“ Lying back , hair on the pillow , your naked body stretched out on top of the duvet . ”
183597	183645	183590	183590	I	5148	“ As much as I love the fantasy , jeans and a ratty T - shirt are closer to the truth . Jamie ’s in the other room . Which reminds me — where are you ? You ’re not still in Palm Springs , are you ? ”
183646	183685	183689	183689	his	5148	“ The day was interminable . I ’m in the limo now , getting close to LA . I ’m going to send a driver to pick you up . I want you home when I get there . ”
183723	183730	183731	183731	he	5148	“ I want you in bed , ”
183734	183740	183731	183731	he	5148	“ I want you naked . ”
183750	183757	183758	183758	I	5148	“ But the bed ’s here , ”
183781	183785	183786	183786	he	5148	“ The apartment , ”
183789	183845	183786	183786	he	5148	“ The security desk will give you the codes to get inside . Naked , Nikki . Leave your clothes in a pile by the door so I can see them when I get home . I want to know you ’re inside and that you ’re wet and that you ’re waiting for me . ”
183880	183982	183877	183877	his	5148	“ There ’s wine in the fridge . Pour yourself a glass and sip it . Take it to the living room . You ’ll be thinking of me , Nikki , alone in my house . Alone in all those places I ’ve fucked you . You ’ll lie down on the couch with your wine beside you . One hand on the glass , one hand on your breast . Maybe a dab of wine on your fingertips as your hand drifts lazily over your body . You ’ll be thinking of me , wo n’t you , baby ? ”
183983	183986	183987	183987	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
183992	184023	183877	183877	his	5148	“ Your breasts . Your nipples . The insides of your thighs . I want you wet for me , baby . A little drunk and a whole lot wet . ”
184024	184027	184028	184028	I	5148	“ Damien . ”
184101	184106	184107	184107	he	5148	“ Do you understand ? ”
184110	184113	184107	184107	he	5148	“ Mmm . ”
184114	184187	184188	184188	he	5148	“ And when you get my text that I ’m pulling in to the garage , I want you to go in the bedroom and lie facedown on the bed . Then spread your legs . I ’ll be there soon , and when I step into the bedroom the first thing I want to see is you wide open and wet for me . I ’ve missed you today , Nikki , ”
184199	184242	184188	184188	he	5148	“ I need to touch you . I want my hand on your cunt when you come , and I want to hold you tight as you tremble in my arms . Mostly , I want to hear you scream my name . ”
184253	184256	184257	184257	Jamie	1450	“ What ? ”
184312	184315	184316	184316	I	5148	“ Nothing , ”
184321	184329	184316	184316	I	5148	“ I ’m just talking to Damien . ”
184330	184335	184336	184336	she	1450	“ Sorry , what ? ”
184347	184361	184336	184336	she	1450	“ I ’m off the phone . Ready to start the movie again ? ”
184362	184365	184366	184366	I	5148	“ I — ”
184426	184430	184420	184420	I	5148	“ Hang on , ”
184435	184442	184431	184431	I	5148	“ I ’m on the phone . ”
184443	184448	184449	184449	She	1450	“ Oh . Sorry . ”
184455	184460	184461	184461	I	5148	“ You still there ? ”
184467	184470	184431	184431	I	5148	“ Always . ”
184471	184483	184431	184431	I	5148	“ Listen , what you just said , it sounds wonderful — ”
184484	184493	184431	184431	I	5148	“ I ’m very glad you think so . ”
184494	184503	184431	184431	I	5148	“ But I ca n’t . Not tonight . ”
184508	184514	184431	184431	I	5148	“ Damien ? You there ? ”
184515	184520	184521	184521	I	5148	“ I ’m here . ”
184529	184546	184431	184431	I	5148	“ It ’s just that Jamie and I are doing a girls ’ night , and — ”
184547	184552	184553	184553	he	5148	“ It ’s okay , ”
184581	184586	184574	184574	I	5148	“ I ’m disappointed . ”
184587	184592	184593	184593	I	5148	“ Me , too , ”
184596	184604	184605	184605	I	5148	“ You going to survive without me ? ”
184614	184620	184621	184621	he	5148	“ It will be hard , ”
184624	184633	184621	184621	he	5148	“ but it ’s probably for the best . ”
184634	184639	184640	184640	I	5148	“ Thanks a lot , ”
184646	184676	184640	184640	I	5148	“ I have a stack of reports I need to get through this weekend . If I can get through them tonight , then Saturday and Sunday are yours . ”
184677	184714	184621	184621	he	5148	“ In that case , I have no guilt whatsoever . Go forth and review , buy , trade , or barter . Whatever it is you do to keep the Damien Stark universe from collapsing . ”
184715	184723	184724	184724	he	5148	“ I ’ll get right on that , ”
184728	184747	184724	184724	he	5148	“ And I ’ll see you tomorrow . You can tell me all about your first day then . ”
184748	184751	184621	184621	he	5148	“ Okay . ”
184752	184756	184757	184757	he	5148	“ Until then , ”
184760	184768	184757	184757	he	5148	“ think of me , touching you . ”
184769	184774	184775	184775	I	5148	“ I always do , ”
184831	184845	184822	184822	I	5148	“ How can you even think about eating more ? I ’m stuffed . ”
184846	184856	184857	184857	She	2613	“ Like anyone could be too full for chips . ”
184869	184879	184857	184857	She	2613	“ Did he want you to come over tonight ? ”
184880	184895	184896	184896	I	5148	“ He wanted me at the apartment when he got home from the desert , ”
184921	184924	184925	184925	Jamie	1450	“ Seriously ? ”
184937	184943	184933	184933	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
184944	184970	184925	184925	Jamie	1450	“ Checking for fever . Are you ill ? I thought that all Damien had to do was crook his finger and you ’d come . ”
184971	184981	184982	184982	I	5148	“ I told him we were hanging out tonight , ”
184998	185019	184995	184995	I	5148	“ And for the record , you ’re right . He crooks his finger , and I most definitely come . ”
185111	185114	185115	185115	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
185118	185123	185115	185115	I	5148	“ What ’s up ? ”
185124	185130	185152	185152	He	837	“ Are you with Stark ? ”
185146	185151	185142	185142	I	5148	“ No . Why ? ”
185166	185179	185152	185152	He	837	“ I just did n’t want to interrupt . Swear to God . ”
185180	185190	185152	185152	He	837	“ Sorry . No , I ’m at home . ”
185191	185208	185152	185152	He	837	“ Yeah ? That ’s cool . So would you be up for getting a drink ? ”
185209	185212	185152	185152	He	837	“ Now ? ”
185348	185356	185357	185357	I	5148	“ Do you want to just hang ? ”
185360	185371	185357	185357	I	5148	“ Or is there something you want to talk about ? ”
185400	185403	185404	185404	he	837	“ Both , ”
185408	185426	185404	185404	he	837	“ Oh , hell , Nikki . This is bullshit , and you know it , too . ”
185441	185445	185446	185446	I	5148	“ What is ? ”
185449	185459	185460	185460	he	837	“ Charles mentioned the party at Stark ’s tomorrow , ”
185482	185502	185503	185503	He	0	“ He just assumed I was invited , too , what with me and you being me and you . ”
185523	185526	185520	185520	his	0	“ Ollie — ”
185556	185576	185577	185577	Ollie	837	“ I think this is the first time you ’ve thrown a party that I was n’t invited to , ”
185580	185589	185590	185590	I	5148	“ I ’m not the one throwing it , ”
185677	185722	185674	185674	He	837	“ It ’s just — look , I ’m sorry , okay ? I get that you ’re with the guy . And , yeah , I have my issues with him , but if this means that we ca n’t be friends anymore … ”
185735	185748	185723	185723	He	837	“ I do n’t want to screw up our friendship , either , ”
185791	185797	185798	185798	he	837	“ So how about it ? ”
185801	185823	185798	185798	he	837	“ Let ’s go get a drink . Hang out . Make up dialogue for the people at the next table . ”
185921	185928	185929	185929	I	5148	“ Tonight ’s kind of hard , ”
185936	185943	185929	185929	I	5148	“ But hold on a second . ”
185957	185970	185944	185944	I	5148	“ What do you think ? Want to make tonight a threesome ? ”
185971	185982	185929	185929	I	5148	“ I ’m not really into that kind of kink . ”
185988	185999	185983	185983	I	5148	“ Seriously , Ollie wants to go out for drinks . ”
186000	186006	186007	186007	I	5148	“ With both of us ? ”
186016	186055	185944	185944	I	5148	“ He only invited me , but if you two ca n’t play nice together then you should n’t have jumped into bed in the first place . Seriously , James . You need to get past this . ”
186064	186094	186056	186056	She	2629	“ Hey , fair enough . But I ’m not the only one being weird . You have n’t been in the pro - Ollie camp lately , either . ”
186095	186125	186056	186056	She	2629	“ So maybe we all three need to have an intervention . Go out . Have fun . Pretend like things are back the way they used to be . ”
186139	186146	186147	186147	she	2629	“ So Courtney ’s not coming ? ”
186156	186180	186128	186128	she	2629	“ He did n’t say . I ’m guessing not . She ’s probably traveling this week . So what do you think ? ”
186181	186186	186187	186187	she	2629	“ Yeah , sure , ”
186190	186195	186187	186187	she	2629	“ But not drinks . ”
186196	186205	186128	186128	she	2629	“ Jamie , if you do n’t want — ”
186206	186211	186212	186212	she	2629	“ No , no , ”
186215	186243	186212	186212	she	2629	“ I do . And tonight ’s fine . I just mean that you and I already have plans later , anyway . Ollie can tag along . ”
186244	186248	186128	186128	she	2629	“ What plans ? ”
186256	186275	186128	186128	she	2629	“ Raine invited us to a party at The Rooftop and Garreth Todd is going to be there . ”
186276	186282	186283	186283	I	5148	“ Who ’s Garreth Todd ? ”
186286	186310	186128	186128	she	2629	“ He , my clueless friend , is the hottest thing in Hollywood right now . And we ’re going to meet him . ”
186311	186330	186128	186128	she	2629	“ Alan Rickman or Sean Connery , I ’d be excited . Garreth Todd , not so much . ”
186331	186349	186128	186128	she	2629	“ Well , you ’re going anyway . This is our night to have fun , remember ? ”
186432	186452	186536	186536	My	5148	“ Wo n’t the press be there ? I ’m really not in the mood to deal with them . ”
186453	186535	186583	186583	he	837	“ Nah , Raine explained how it works . They ’ll be hanging around the entrance probably , but since they do n’t expect you , just wear a hat and keep your head down . Ollie and I can flank you . It ’s totally no big . And once we ’re at the party , the only photographers are part of Garreth ’s PR corp . So it ’ll be a vulture - free night . Swear to God . ”
186562	186565	186566	186566	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
187160	187167	187168	187168	she	1450	“ Amazing , is n’t it ? ”
187171	187185	187186	187186	I	5148	“ It ’s exactly what I would expect a Hollywood party to be , ”
187206	187212	187213	187213	she	1450	“ Do n’t be cynical , ”
187216	187239	187240	187240	She	1450	“ From what Raine tells me , this is one of the parties of the summer , and it ’s incredibly exclusive . ”
187250	187264	187240	187240	She	1450	“ Steve said he ’s been finagling to get an invite for months . ”
187265	187270	187271	187271	I	5148	“ Steve ’s here ? ”
187282	187287	187288	187288	Steve	382	“ What about Anderson ? ”
187346	187362	187363	187363	Jamie	1450	“ He ’s here , too . I told them we ’re by the pods , ”
187380	187387	187363	187363	Jamie	1450	“ They ’re making the circuit . ”
187472	187480	187481	187481	Ollie	837	“ This really is ostentatious as hell , ”
187484	187501	187481	187481	Ollie	837	“ but it ’s also pretty damn cool . I mean , look at this place . ”
187638	187641	187642	187642	I	5148	“ Okay , ”
187645	187654	187642	187642	I	5148	“ Y’all win . It ’s pretty cool . ”
187678	187685	187686	187686	I	5148	“ So where is your guy ? ”
187700	187733	187686	187686	I	5148	“ Unless he fell off the roof , he ’s here somewhere . Let ’s wait here for Steve and Anderson , then we can go make the circle and find him . ”
187734	187744	187745	187745	Ollie	837	“ So are you getting serious about this guy ? ”
187749	187770	187745	187745	Ollie	837	“ I mean , after a guy like me , it ’s hard to imagine you could want anyone else . ”
187811	187814	187815	187815	Jamie	1450	“ Yeah , ”
187823	187843	187815	187815	Jamie	1450	“ Emphasis on the ‘ getting . ’ We ’re not there yet . But , well , yeah . ”
187844	187847	187848	187848	Ollie	837	“ Good , ”
187872	187882	187883	187883	Jamie	1450	“ Now , if you want to talk serious … ”
187901	187907	187897	187897	I	5148	“ A lady never tells . ”
187908	187915	187916	187916	Ollie	837	“ It ’s too damn soon , ”
187920	187923	187924	187924	He	837	“ And — ”
187929	187932	187933	187933	I	5148	“ What ? ”
187936	187948	187933	187933	I	5148	“ The whole thing just worries me . Stark worries me . ”
187949	187954	187955	187955	Jamie	1450	“ Jesus H. Christ , ”
187959	187969	187955	187955	Jamie	1450	“ Do n’t you ever give it a rest ? ”
188012	188020	188021	188021	Ollie	837	“ That ’s why I love her , ”
188030	188044	188021	188021	Ollie	837	“ She tells it like it is and does n’t take my shit . ”
188045	188049	188050	188050	I	5148	“ And what ? ”
188053	188066	188050	188050	I	5148	“ Courtney does n’t tell you when you ’re being a prick ? ”
188143	188146	188147	188147	Ollie	837	“ No , ”
188151	188156	188157	188157	He	837	“ She does n’t . ”
188201	188220	188182	188182	he	837	“ She just waits until all the shit has built up and then she breaks up with me . ”
188237	188252	188253	188253	Ollie	837	“ I thought you were n’t going to let any more shit build up . ”
188336	188342	188343	188343	Ollie	837	“ I ’m like Pigpen , ”
188346	188368	188343	188343	Ollie	837	“ Shit just follows me around . Not all of us lead the charmed life of a certain billionaire we know . ”
188369	188374	188375	188375	He	837	“ Dammit , Ollie ! ”
188383	188394	188375	188375	He	837	“ Sorry , sorry , I ’m a total prick . ”
188395	188398	188399	188399	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
188402	188406	188407	188407	I	5148	“ You are . ”
188413	188454	188407	188407	I	5148	“ Look , I ’m sorry you have a problem with Damien , but he ’s important to me . And if I ’m important to you , then you need to figure out a way to deal with that . ”
188455	188461	188462	188462	Ollie	837	“ That ’s the point , ”
188465	188504	188505	188505	he	837	“ You are important to me . And I can deal with Stark . I can even ignore all the shit on him I could dig up in just one hour in the Bender , Twain file room , ”
188517	188542	188505	188505	he	837	“ It ’s not the man that ’s the problem — well , not the big problem . It ’s what ’s around him . ”
188543	188550	188567	188567	he	837	“ What are you talking about ? ”
188551	188566	188567	188567	he	837	“ Come on , Nikki , you practically disguised yourself to come here tonight , ”
188584	188598	188599	188599	he	837	“ Do you want that life ? Hell , can you handle it ? ”
188617	188626	188599	188599	he	837	“ I just worry about you is all . ”
188683	188692	188693	188693	I	5148	“ Damien ’s worried about the same thing , ”
188697	188704	188705	188705	I	5148	“ But I can stand it , ”
188718	188735	188705	188705	I	5148	“ I am standing it , and I want to , because Damien is worth it . ”
188740	188755	188736	188736	His	837	“ Who would have thought I ’d have something in common with Damien Stark ? ”
188765	188768	188769	188769	he	837	“ Seriously , ”
188772	188790	188769	188769	he	837	“ I may have my issues with Stark , but I also know he cares about you . ”
188791	188795	188796	188796	I	5148	“ He does , ”
188834	188838	188839	188839	Jamie	1450	“ Thank God , ”
188842	188849	188839	188839	Jamie	1450	“ You guys have perfect timing . ”
188942	188947	188948	188948	he	474	“ Well , hello , ”
188957	188966	188948	188948	he	474	“ I do n’t think we ’ve met . ”
188967	188970	188971	188971	I	5148	“ Nikki , ”
189011	189019	189020	189020	he	474	“ I hope you ’re having fun , ”
189081	189090	189091	189091	Todd	474	“ We were going for a celestial theme , ”
189094	189098	189091	189091	Todd	474	“ Get it ? ”
189099	189105	189106	189106	I	5148	“ It ’s very colorful , ”
189109	189123	189124	189124	he	474	“ It does n’t even come close to sparkling the way you do , ”
189214	189224	189225	189225	I	5148	“ You have me at a disadvantage , sugar , ”
189238	189259	189225	189225	I	5148	“ You know my name , but I do n’t have even a teensy , tiny clue as to yours . ”
189260	189263	189264	189264	He	5148	“ Oh . ”
189280	189286	189264	189264	He	5148	“ I ’m Garreth Todd . ”
189287	189301	189225	189225	I	5148	“ Very nice to meet you . And what is it you do ? ”
189331	189340	189341	189341	Ollie	837	“ I thought we were going to dance , ”
189350	189354	189355	189355	I	5148	“ Of course , ”
189364	189374	189355	189355	I	5148	“ So nice chatting with you , Mr. Todd . ”
189375	189383	189384	189384	Ollie	837	“ You just dissed a movie star , ”
189395	189398	189399	189399	I	5148	“ Oh ? ”
189410	189417	189399	189399	I	5148	“ Was he a movie star ? ”
189423	189431	189418	189418	Ollie	837	“ Jamie is going to kill you . ”
189432	189436	189437	189437	I	5148	“ I know , ”
189463	189472	189418	189418	Ollie	837	“ You have to admit he deserved it . ”
189473	189478	189479	189479	Ollie	837	“ I admit nothing , ”
189487	189499	189483	189483	he	837	“ So we ’re here . Are we going to dance ? ”
189522	189525	189526	189526	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
189675	189678	189679	189679	Damien	5148	“ Go , ”
189757	189760	189761	189761	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
189764	189767	189768	189768	he	837	“ No , ”
190022	190026	190027	190027	I	5148	“ Say something , ”
190081	190086	190078	190078	his	5148	“ I ’m sorry . ”
190087	190092	190093	190093	I	5148	“ You’re — what ? ”
190115	190120	190121	190121	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
190138	190182	190183	190183	I	5148	“ Is this some sort of reverse psychology ? Because I know you pretty well , Damien Stark , and that was n’t repentance I saw in your eyes when you crashed through the crowd . More like scary megalomaniac fury . Besides , ”
190190	190199	190183	190183	I	5148	“ I ’m the one who ’s sorry . ”
190223	190227	190228	190228	he	5148	“ First off , ”
190231	190253	190228	190228	he	5148	“ I did n’t crash through the crowd . I walked , and quite calmly , too , considering the circumstances . ”
190263	190266	190267	190267	he	5148	“ Second , ”
190270	190289	190290	190290	he	5148	“ I believe a megalomaniac is someone who suffers from delusions about their own power . Trust me , ”
190307	190337	190296	190296	I	5148	“ I suffer no delusions about the extent of my power . And finally , you may have reason to be sorry . I , however , have more . ”
190338	190343	190344	190344	I	5148	“ I — oh . ”
190377	190393	190365	190365	he	5148	“ I should have told you that Jamie and I were going out with Ollie . ”
190394	190402	190296	190296	I	5148	“ So you knew at the time ? ”
190403	190441	190442	190442	I	5148	“ No . Raine called later and told Jamie about the party . Then Ollie called and ended up coming along . I actually picked up the phone to call you . But then I did n’t , ”
190448	190457	190296	190296	I	5148	“ Because you knew I ’d be pissed . ”
190461	190470	190458	190458	I	5148	“ And that ’s why I ’m sorry . ”
190471	190479	190296	190296	I	5148	“ Then we have that in common . ”
190492	190509	190510	190510	he	5148	“ I do n’t want to be the asshole who keeps you away from your friends , ”
190513	190548	190510	190510	he	5148	“ And I do n’t want you to feel like you have to keep things from me in order to see them . And I ’m sorry because you obviously felt exactly that way . ”
190569	190594	190566	190566	I	5148	“ I wo n’t keep you from your friends , Nikki . But dammit , I do n’t like the son of a bitch . ”
190614	190619	190620	190620	I	5148	“ I get that , ”
190623	190648	190620	190620	I	5148	“ He has n’t exactly earned your trust . But I ’ve known him forever , and he ’s one of my closest friends . ”
190649	190664	190671	190671	he	5148	“ He ’s seen you naked , Nikki . He ’s touched your scars . ”
190673	190677	190671	190671	he	5148	not—“Are you jealous ? ”
190704	190735	190671	190671	he	5148	“ Hell , yes , I ’m jealous . I ’m jealous of anyone who comforts you . Who pulls you into his arms and makes the hurt go away . ”
190736	190746	190747	190747	I	5148	“ I did n’t even know you back then , ”
190750	190769	190747	190747	I	5148	“ And I ’m jealous of the time that he ’s had with you that I have n’t . ”
190770	190777	190671	190671	he	5148	“ You ’re not being fair . ”
190778	190825	190826	190826	I	5148	“ I ’m not being fair at all . But that does n’t change the facts . You ’re not just friends . You have n’t been for a long time . At least not since he got you through the hell with that asshole Kurt . ”
190855	190876	190877	190877	Damien	5148	“ Ollie ’s in love with you , Nikki . It ’s the one thing I do respect him for , ”
190880	190888	190877	190877	Damien	5148	“ He has excellent taste in women . ”
190968	190975	190961	190961	Courtney	271	“ He ’s engaged , Damien , ”
191007	191013	191014	191014	Damien	5148	“ I know he is , ”
191017	191059	191014	191014	Damien	5148	“ And maybe he loves his fiancée , I do n’t know . But I do know that he loves you . And one of these days , that ’s going to cause a very big problem between him and me . ”
191066	191120	191060	191060	I	5148	“ Do n’t go all Wild West on me . Though with all your money , I guess it would be more Stark Manor than O.K. Corral , and a duel instead of a gunfight . But be careful , Damien . Ollie grew up in Texas . He ’s a good shot . ”
191121	191128	191129	191129	Damien	5148	“ I ’m a better one , ”
191144	191153	191060	191060	I	5148	“ I really am glad you ’re here . ”
191154	191172	191060	191060	I	5148	“ As am I. It ’s good to hold you . This entire day has been challenging . ”
191195	191198	191173	191173	I	5148	“ Sorry . ”
191205	191208	191209	191209	he	5148	“ No , ”
191212	191221	191222	191222	He	5148	“ Not you . But there are things . ”
191235	191266	191267	191267	He	5148	“ Tapestries that I ’ve woven carefully over the years are starting to unravel . I do n’t like it when things do n’t go as I plan or expect . ”
191275	191296	191267	191267	He	5148	“ You may not have noticed it about me , but I am most comfortable when I am in control . ”
191297	191308	191355	191355	I	5148	“ I ’m shocked , Mr. Stark . Truly shocked . ”
191326	191354	191316	191316	he	5148	“ Actually , I suppose you do fall within those parameters . I wanted you at home . You said no . I did n’t like it . ”
191368	191392	191355	191355	I	5148	“ I suppose if it bothers you that much , you can simply tie me up and keep me permanently at your side . ”
191487	191493	191494	191494	he	5148	“ Why , Ms. Fairchild , ”
191497	191506	191494	191494	he	5148	“ I believe you ’re thinking naughty thoughts . ”
191507	191510	191511	191511	I	5148	“ Very , ”
191514	191526	191527	191527	he	5148	“ I may have to take you up on your suggestion , ”
191555	191560	191561	191561	he	5148	“ Tie you up , ”
191574	191579	191580	191580	He	5148	“ Keep you close . ”
191619	191633	191611	191611	his	5148	“ But first , I think you need to be very thoroughly spanked . ”
191646	191654	191634	191634	I	5148	“ I ’d rather be thoroughly fucked . ”
191668	191681	191655	191655	He	5148	“ Oh , God , Nikki . What you do to me . ”
191682	191685	191686	191686	I	5148	“ No , ”
191695	191711	191686	191686	I	5148	“ What you do to me . And please , Damien , do it soon . ”
191712	191717	191718	191718	he	5148	“ We ’re leaving , ”
191728	191734	191735	191735	I	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
191783	191787	191788	191788	he	5148	“ The apartment , ”
191889	191893	191877	191877	I	5148	“ Mr. Stark ! ”
191894	191897	191877	191877	I	5148	“ Damien ! ”
191898	191904	191877	191877	I	5148	“ Nikki , over here ! ”
191905	191924	191877	191877	I	5148	“ What can you say about your refusal to speak at the dedication of the Richter Tennis Center ? ”
191925	191935	191877	191877	I	5148	“ Can you explain your decision , Mr. Stark ? ”
192058	192070	192076	192076	Damien	5148	“ What about the rumors out of Germany , Mr. Stark ? ”
192094	192105	192083	192083	he	5148	“ Nikki , is Damien Stark off the bachelor block ? ”
192106	192126	192083	192083	he	5148	“ Damien ! How will the talk of a possible German indictment affect your holdings in the European Union ? ”
192205	192215	192237	192237	Damien	5148	“ Nikki ! Mr. Stark ! Germany ! Indictment ! ”
192225	192236	192237	192237	Damien	5148	“ Richter ! Dedication ! Damien ! Damien ! Damien ! ”
192265	192268	192269	192269	Damien	5148	“ No , ”
192272	192278	192269	192269	Damien	5148	“ I ’ve got it . ”
192366	192381	192382	192382	Damien	5148	“ I will not be attending the dedication ceremony for the Richter Tennis Center , ”
192396	192442	192382	192382	Damien	5148	“ While I fully support the construction and operation of such a center , I can not in good conscience support its dedication honoring a man I do n’t respect . As for your other questions , neither Ms. Fairchild nor I have any comment . ”
192539	192544	192545	192545	I	5148	“ Damien Jeremiah Stark ! ”
192596	192602	192603	192603	Damien	5148	“ Get into the car , ”
192608	192614	192615	192616	the man	225	“ We need to talk , ”
192624	192628	192629	192629	Damien	5148	“ Get in , ”
192659	192664	192665	192665	I	5148	“ Who is that ? ”
192681	192685	192668	192668	He	5148	“ My father . ”
192698	192701	192702	192702	he	5148	“ Go , ”
192771	192774	192775	192775	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
192778	192797	192775	192775	I	5148	“ Let him in . If you do n’t , those reporters are going to eat him alive . ”
192800	192803	192804	192804	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
192808	192819	192804	192804	I	5148	“ You need to find out why he ’s here . ”
192850	192853	192854	192854	he	5148	“ Stop , ”
192858	192881	192854	192854	he	5148	“ Unlock the doors . And as soon as he ’s in , run those goddamned piranhas over if you have to . ”
192941	192946	192947	192947	Damien	5148	“ Make the block , ”
192965	192971	192950	192950	He	2716	“ What do you want ? ”
192983	192989	192990	192990	he	2716	“ You must be Nikki , ”
192993	193017	192990	192990	he	2716	“ I ’ve seen your picture in the paper with my boy . I ’m Jeremiah , but you can call me Jerry . ”
193018	193029	193030	193030	I	5148	“ What can we do for you , Mr. Stark ? ”
193033	193036	193037	193037	he	2716	“ We , ”
193048	193051	193052	193052	he	2716	“ We , ”
193086	193094	193095	193095	Damien	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild asked you a question , ”
193098	193106	193095	193095	Damien	5148	“ What can we do for you ? ”
193191	193194	193195	193195	he	5148	“ Damien , ”
193260	193264	193265	193265	Damien	5148	“ I repeat , ”
193268	193276	193265	193265	Damien	5148	“ what can we do for you ? ”
193326	193369	193277	193277	Jerry	5148	“ What can you do for me ? What can you do for me ? Not a goddamn thing now . But this ai n’t about me . It ’s about you . And you managed to fuck it up real good . ”
193370	193374	193375	193375	Damien	5148	“ Did I ? ”
193379	193424	193375	193375	Damien	5148	“ Let me explain the situation to you . You are in this car only because the lady insisted . If you want to earn the right to stay , then you speak , and you speak clearly . Otherwise , we are through . ”
193425	193553	193277	193277	Jerry	5148	“ You want clarity ? How ’s this : You ’re acting like a damn fool , Damien Stark , and I may be a lot of things , but I am not the father of a fool . You get your high - class PR people to put some sort of spin on that nonsense you just spouted . You write a speech that would make angels sing . And you get your ass to that dedication on Friday , and you smile that photogenic smile , and you write a big , fat check if you have to . Because you need to do this , son . You need to push it through . You need to be goddamn squeaky clean , damn you . ”
193554	193563	193375	193375	Damien	5148	“ Do n’t call me ‘ son . ’ ”
193564	193569	193277	193277	Jerry	5148	“ Goddammit , Damien ! ”
193746	193755	193735	193735	he	5148	“ How much of this is your doing ? ”
193756	193767	193768	193768	Jerry	5148	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
193793	193800	193801	193801	Damien	5148	“ Let ’s get this straight , ”
193804	193825	193826	193826	We	2732	“ I am not interested in your opinion or your help . Now get out . Edward , pull over . ”
193848	193857	193826	193826	We	2732	“ I ’m not even parked near here . ”
193858	193864	193865	193865	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t care , ”
193868	193871	193865	193865	Damien	5148	“ Out . ”
193892	193905	193906	193906	he	366	“ Does she know ? I would n’t tell her , Damien , ”
193917	193933	193906	193906	he	366	“ If you want her to stay , I would n’t tell her a thing . ”
193970	193975	193976	193976	he	366	“ I ’m sorry , ”
193979	194003	194004	194004	I	5148	“ So , you ’ve met my mom and I ’ve met your dad . I guess that means we ’re really dating . ”
194021	194024	194025	194025	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
194028	194033	194025	194025	I	5148	“ It ’s okay . ”
194034	194048	194014	194014	Damien	5148	“ Very little about this entire day falls into the category of okay . ”
194049	194057	194058	194058	I	5148	“ Oh , I do n’t know , ”
194061	194069	194058	194058	I	5148	“ I rather enjoyed dancing with you . ”
194070	194073	194074	194074	he	366	“ Yes , ”
194077	194084	194085	194085	I	5148	“ So did I. Come here . ”
194407	194418	194392	194392	he	5148	“ What was it you said about tying you up ? ”
194433	194436	194437	194437	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
194528	194531	194532	194532	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
194539	194544	194532	194532	I	5148	“ Yes , please . ”
194721	194727	194728	194728	he	5148	“ Why , Ms. Fairchild , ”
194731	194739	194728	194728	he	5148	“ I do believe you want me . ”
194832	194835	194794	194794	he	5148	“ Trouble ? ”
194836	194847	194794	194794	he	5148	“ I thought you were going to tie me up . ”
194848	194855	194794	194794	he	5148	“ Maybe I changed my mind . ”
194856	194859	194794	194794	he	5148	“ Oh . ”
194860	194866	194794	194794	he	5148	“ Complaining , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
194867	194875	194794	194794	he	5148	“ Never with you , Mr. Stark . ”
194876	194888	194889	194889	His	5148	“ Good answer . For that , you get a reward . ”
194897	194902	194889	194889	His	5148	“ Come with me . ”
194961	194969	194950	194950	We	2747	“ What are you going to do ? ”
195016	195022	195023	195023	he	5148	“ Hands above your head , ”
195071	195081	195082	195082	he	5148	“ I ’m going to please you , Nikki , ”
195169	195177	195178	195178	he	5148	“ Do you see how you writhe ? ”
195181	195205	195178	195178	he	5148	“ That movement lets you control the intensity so that you ’re not overwhelmed by the onslaught of sensations . Do you understand ? ”
195209	195220	195221	195221	he	5148	“ I ’m going to take that away from you , ”
195285	195292	195293	195293	Damien	5148	“ There will be no writhing , ”
195312	195321	195296	195296	he	5148	“ No shifting . No place to hide . ”
195606	195619	195620	195620	he	5148	“ I ’m giving you pleasure , pain , and beauty combined , ”
195623	195653	195620	195620	he	5148	“ I want to look at you like this , open for me , your legs bent , your body like a diamond shining bright and glistening for me . ”
195695	195702	195703	195703	he	5148	“ You ’re like the portrait , ”
195706	195728	195703	195703	he	5148	“ A vision of erotic beauty . But a portrait is n’t flesh , and its beauty ca n’t feel pleasure . ”
196003	196037	196038	196038	he	5148	“ You ’re wet , baby . And every quiver , every sign , every dewy hint of your arousal is on display for me . Tell me you like it , Nikki , ”
196046	196058	196038	196038	he	5148	“ Tell me you like being open and ready for me . ”
196152	196154	196146	196146	I	5148	“ like ”
196199	196202	196191	196191	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
196531	196541	196510	196510	he	5148	“ You ’re a cruel man , Mr. Stark . ”
196542	196546	196547	196547	He	5148	“ Am I ? ”
196654	196657	196658	196658	he	5148	“ Cruel ? ”
196661	196673	196658	196658	he	5148	“ Or am I being very , very good to you ? ”
196674	196677	196678	196678	I	5148	“ Cruel , ”
196771	196778	196779	196779	he	5148	“ Tell me what you want , ”
196782	196791	196779	196779	he	5148	“ I want to hear you say it . ”
196802	196805	196806	196806	I	5148	“ You , ”
196815	196822	196806	196806	I	5148	“ I want you inside me . ”
196823	196829	196830	196830	he	5148	“ Why , Ms. Fairchild , ”
196849	196859	196839	196839	his	5148	“ Are you saying you want to be fucked ? ”
196860	196865	196839	196839	his	5148	“ God , yes . ”
196866	196872	196873	196873	He	5148	“ I like your answer . ”
196892	196903	196880	196880	His	5148	“ But I do n’t think you ’re quite ready . ”
196925	196929	196930	196930	I	5148	“ Mr. Stark , ”
196934	196961	196930	196930	I	5148	“ if you ca n’t tell how ready I am , then I ’m afraid you ’re not as skilled a lover as I had thought . ”
196962	196967	196968	196968	he	5148	“ On the contrary , ”
196971	197003	196968	196968	he	5148	“ I ’m an exceptional lover . You just need to be more patient and let me prove it to you , slowly , methodically , and very , very thoroughly . ”
197061	197066	197048	197048	I	5148	“ Damien , please . ”
197067	197070	197071	197071	He	5148	“ This ? ”
197133	197136	197137	197137	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
197147	197153	197137	197137	I	5148	“ But more . You . ”
197431	197436	197437	197437	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
197447	197452	197453	197453	I	5148	“ That was spectacular , ”
197477	197482	197466	197466	He	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
197483	197486	197487	197487	I	5148	“ Mmm . ”
197492	197503	197504	197504	I	5148	“ More than okay . But just a little stiff , ”
197631	197634	197671	197671	He	5148	“ Damien ? ”
197635	197638	197639	197639	His	5148	“ Yes ? ”
197653	197670	197671	197671	He	5148	“ What was your father talking about ? Why do you need to be squeaky clean ? ”
197683	197690	197691	197691	Damien	5148	“ He ’s yanking my chain , ”
197713	197716	197717	197717	He	5148	“ Damien — ”
197770	197781	197766	197766	I	5148	“ How did you know where to find me tonight ? ”
197830	197850	197807	197807	He	5148	“ Do n’t you know , Nikki ? No matter where you go , I will always find you . ”
198040	198059	198032	198033	Ms. Peters	0	“ Good morning . He and Mr. Maynard are on the phone . Would you like to wait ? ”
198060	198070	198071	198071	I	5148	“ That ’s okay . He ’s obviously busy . ”
198373	198375	198342	198342	I	5148	“ cleaning ”
198492	198495	198496	198496	she	2772	“ Wow , ”
198499	198504	198496	198496	she	2772	“ You ’re hired . ”
198542	198549	198550	198550	she	2772	“ Will there be food tonight ? ”
198553	198558	198559	198559	I	5148	“ Appetizers and drinks , ”
198562	198569	198533	198533	she	2772	“ Wanna grab a late lunch ? ”
198573	198598	198570	198570	I	5148	“ Sure . Edward will be here at six to get us , so we want to leave time to come back and change . ”
198599	198604	198605	198605	Jamie	1450	“ In the limo ? ”
198609	198615	198616	198616	I	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
198624	198648	198616	198616	I	5148	“ But if you go wipe down the bathroom counters , I ’ll text Damien and tell him that ’s what we want . ”
198668	198674	198675	198675	Jamie	1450	“ Holy architecture , Batman , ”
198897	198903	198904	198904	Jamie	1450	“ This place is fabulous , ”
198921	198925	198926	198926	I	5148	“ I know , ”
198966	198971	198926	198926	I	5148	“ Want a tour ? ”
198972	198976	198977	198977	she	1450	“ Drink first , ”
198980	198984	198977	198977	she	1450	“ Tour later . ”
198985	198991	198992	198992	I	5148	“ Come on , then . ”
199081	199084	199085	199085	she	1450	“ Wow , ”
199088	199116	199085	199085	she	1450	“ Amazing , huh ? The workers just finished the shelving a few days ago . I have no idea where Damien was storing all those books . ”
199424	199437	199438	199438	Evelyn	5962	“ Not a bad way to greet visitors , eh , Texas ? ”
199469	199484	199485	199485	she	5962	“ You are as gorgeous in that painting as you are in real life , ”
199504	199511	199495	199495	She	5962	“ And you must be Jamie . ”
199512	199519	199495	199495	She	5962	“ I guess I must be . ”
199520	199536	199495	199495	She	5962	“ Well , then , turn around and let me have a look at you . ”
199573	199588	199547	199547	she	5962	“ Good ass , nice tits . Definitely got the face and the hair . ”
199589	199592	199593	199593	Jamie	1450	“ What ? ”
199598	199607	199593	199593	Jamie	1450	“ Is there something wrong with my legs ? ”
199615	199620	199621	199621	She	5962	“ I like her . ”
199627	199636	199621	199621	She	5962	“ Texas tells me you ’re an actress . ”
199637	199642	199643	199643	Jamie	1450	“ Trying to be , ”
199646	199692	199643	199643	Jamie	1450	“ Well , assuming you can actually act , you ’ve got the right equipment to make it in this business . And between you and me , your assets are good enough that you can probably even make it without that pesky talent thing . ”
199693	199698	199699	199699	Jamie	1450	“ I can act , ”
199703	199738	199768	199768	Evelyn	5962	“ You find me later . We ’ll talk . I may not be in the business anymore , but that does n’t mean I do n’t still have a hand in the pie . ”
199739	199742	199768	199768	Evelyn	5962	“ Sure . ”
199758	199767	199768	199768	Evelyn	5962	“ Thank you . That would be great . ”
199819	199837	199838	199838	She	5962	“ Come on in , girls . No point in standing here on the landing all night . ”
199957	199961	199962	199962	she	5962	“ Come on , ”
199971	200041	199962	199962	she	5962	“ I ’ll introduce you to the man of the hour . Nikki , if you ’re looking for Damien , he said he was going to go change . By the way , looks like great minds think alike . Turns out he did help Giselle get the paintings back from Palm Springs . Edward was bringing some in from the limo yesterday when I was finishing up . ”
200042	200045	200046	200046	Her	5962	“ Oh . ”
200580	200584	200574	200574	I	5148	“ Missed you . ”
200585	200590	200559	200559	him	5148	“ Missed you more . ”
200591	200596	200574	200574	I	5148	“ Is everything okay ? ”
200602	200608	200597	200597	He	5148	“ Of course . Why ? ”
200609	200623	200559	200559	him	5148	“ I saw you just now . On the phone , I mean . ”
200633	200638	200639	200639	he	5148	“ It ’s nothing , ”
200642	200667	200668	200668	He	5148	“ Something I thought was under control has turned out to be more volatile than I expected . Nothing to worry about , though . ”
200709	200714	200715	200715	he	5148	“ You look beautiful , ”
200737	200744	200745	200745	I	5148	“ Thank you for the dress . ”
200755	200761	200745	200745	I	5148	“ And for the bed . ”
200784	200791	200781	200781	his	5148	“ Damien ? What is it ? ”
200810	200820	200796	200796	I	5148	“ I ’m just very pleased you like them . ”
200821	200827	200830	200830	I	5148	“ Of course I do . ”
200906	200913	200914	200914	I	5148	“ We should join the party , ”
200917	200922	200923	200923	He	5148	“ In a minute . ”
200964	200982	200983	200983	he	5148	“ How is it that I can miss you so much when you ’re not beside me ? ”
200986	200992	200993	200993	I	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
200996	201005	200993	200993	I	5148	“ But I could ask the same question . ”
201006	201011	201022	201022	his	5148	“ Oh , Nikki . ”
201134	201143	201152	201152	He	5148	“ Are we observing formalities , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
201144	201151	201152	201152	He	5148	“ We are , Mr. Stark . ”
201187	201195	201175	201175	Damien	5148	“ Me , too , Ms. Fairchild . ”
201204	201226	201196	201196	I	5148	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . But I will say that you look dashing as usual . ”
201234	201239	201227	201227	I	5148	“ Shall we mingle ? ”
201288	201294	201295	201295	he	5148	“ We ’ve lost them , ”
201298	201319	201295	201295	he	5148	“ Once she starts talking Hollywood , she never stops . And I think she ’s found the perfect audience . ”
201320	201324	201325	201325	I	5148	“ She has , ”
201345	201371	201325	201325	I	5148	“ Jamie can talk classic television and old movies for days , but she ’s just as happy if the conversation shifts to current sitcoms . ”
201372	201388	201389	201389	he	5148	“ In other words , they ’re going to keep each other occupied all night , ”
201392	201397	201398	201398	I	5148	“ Not all night , ”
201401	201410	201398	201398	I	5148	“ I need some Evelyn time , too . ”
201486	201498	201477	201477	I	5148	“ Right now , I want to see your other paintings , ”
201503	201509	201499	201499	I	5148	“ Will you show us ? ”
201510	201513	201514	201517	The three of us	736	“ Sure . ”
202088	202119	202076	202076	Damien	5148	“ This feels like the night we met , Ms. Fairchild . You and I surrounded by erotic art , and me unable to think of anything but fucking you . ”
202125	202136	202120	202120	My	5148	“ We met six years before that , Mr. Stark . ”
202137	202142	202143	202143	he	5148	“ So we did , ”
202152	202162	202143	202143	he	5148	“ I wanted to fuck you then , too . ”
202163	202172	202173	202173	I	5148	“ Do you always get what you want ? ”
202176	202179	202180	202180	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
202198	202204	202189	202189	I	5148	“ I thought you knew . ”
202205	202210	202211	202211	I	5148	“ Why Mr. Stark , ”
202214	202234	202211	202211	I	5148	“ I thought you told me it was bad form to host a party with a hard - on . ”
202235	202238	202239	202239	he	5148	“ True , ”
202242	202267	202239	202239	he	5148	“ Perhaps we should escape to the powder room . I can think of a rather pleasant way to prevent a social faux pas . ”
202268	202272	202273	202273	I	5148	“ Keep talking , ”
202276	202283	202273	202273	I	5148	“ You just might tempt me . ”
202303	202307	202308	202308	I	5148	“ Stop it , ”
202489	202495	202496	202496	Damien	5148	“ You ’re very tense , ”
202499	202512	202496	202496	Damien	5148	“ Again , I can suggest several ways to loosen you up . ”
202569	202576	202577	202577	he	637	“ Tell me , Ms. Fairchild , ”
202580	202600	202577	202577	he	637	“ What will I find if I slide my hand under your skirt ? Did you wear panties tonight ? ”
202601	202610	202611	202611	I	5148	“ Why are Giselle and Bruce here already ? ”
202619	202622	202614	202614	His	637	“ What ? ”
202635	202650	202623	202623	I	5148	“ They do n’t know it ’s me in the portrait , do they ? ”
202685	202694	202695	202695	he	637	“ They ’re not supposed to be here , ”
202704	202707	202708	202708	I	5148	“ No , ”
202711	202720	202721	202721	I	5148	“ Because they do n’t know . Right ? ”
202760	202768	202752	202752	I	5148	“ Damien ? Did you tell them ? ”
202823	202830	202808	202808	his	637	“ Yes , but , Nikki — ”
202839	202847	202834	202834	I	5148	“ Oh , God . How could — ”
203079	203084	203062	203062	He	5148	“ Nikki , please . ”
203085	203088	203089	203089	I	5148	“ No . ”
203106	203112	203113	203113	I	5148	“ And for the record , ”
203121	203140	203113	203113	I	5148	“ of course I wore panties . Game ’s over , remember ? The rules no longer apply . ”
203350	203353	203354	203354	I	5148	“ Nikki ! ”
203468	203484	203485	203485	he	637	“ I wanted to thank you for doing such a great job at Suncoast yesterday , ”
203488	203491	203492	203492	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
203499	203518	203492	203492	I	5148	“ Thank you . I was pleased you gave me such a challenging assignment on my first day . ”
203559	203572	203547	203547	my	5148	“ Challenging because of the work , or because of your partner ? ”
203573	203579	203580	203580	I	5148	“ A little of both , ”
203583	203592	203593	203593	he	2092	“ I promised you that we ’d talk , ”
203596	203603	203593	203593	he	2092	“ Is now a good time ? ”
203670	203673	203674	203674	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
203681	203686	203674	203674	I	5148	“ Now ’s great . ”
203741	203749	203729	203729	I	5148	“ So why is Tanner the wolf ? ”
203756	203775	203750	203750	Bruce	2092	“ Listen , before we get into all of that , I think I owe you an apology . ”
203781	203792	203793	203793	I	5148	“ Because of Tanner ? It was n’t that bad , ”
203796	203814	203750	203750	Bruce	2092	“ No . Because of tonight . Giselle told me that it ’s you in the painting . ”
203835	203864	203917	203917	He	2092	“ To be honest , I did n’t think anything of it . But once we arrived , I realized that you did n’t know that I knew . ”
203865	203870	203871	203871	I	5148	“ It ’s fine , ”
203884	203916	203917	203917	He	2092	“ No . It ’s not . Giselle had no business telling me . I do n’t think she meant anything by it , but sometimes she just does n’t think . ”
203944	203970	203917	203917	He	2092	“ I wanted to talk to you now , though , because I do n’t want you to think that this affects our working relationship . ”
203971	203980	203917	203917	He	2092	“ Of course not . Why would it ? ”
204008	204017	204001	204001	he	2092	“ Did Damien tell you about my sister ? ”
204018	204023	203917	203917	He	2092	“ Um , no . ”
204024	204057	204001	204001	he	2092	“ As brilliant a woman as you will ever meet . She does mathematical equations in her head that I can barely do with a calculator . She teaches at MIT now . ”
204063	204069	204058	204058	I	5148	“ Jessica Tolley - Brown ? ”
204070	204075	203917	203917	He	2092	“ You know her ? ”
204076	204080	204081	204081	I	5148	“ Of her , ”
204091	204113	204081	204081	I	5148	“ I almost entered a PhD program at MIT just so I could study under her . But what does she — ”
204114	204125	203917	203917	He	2092	“ Do you know how she put herself through school ? ”
204126	204134	204081	204081	I	5148	“ No . Scholarships , I assume . ”
204135	204138	204139	204139	he	5148	“ Mostly , ”
204142	204158	204139	204139	he	5148	“ But my sister has expensive taste , and she supplemented her income with modeling . ”
204159	204162	204163	204163	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
204177	204189	204190	204190	he	5148	“ I do n’t have a problem with the female body , ”
204193	204247	204190	204190	he	5148	“ And I do n’t think any less of a woman ’s intellect just because she poses nude . Considering my sister ’s portfolio , and the fact that she can trample me in just about any contest of wits , it would be pretty hypocritical of me , do n’t you think ? ”
204248	204254	204260	204260	he	5148	“ I suppose it would . ”
204268	204288	204260	204260	he	5148	“ And thank you for pulling me aside to tell me . It — well , I appreciate it . ”
204289	204292	204293	204293	He	5148	“ Good . ”
204301	204342	204293	204293	He	5148	“ As for Tanner , again , I ’m sorry . I imagine he gave you a bit of grief . He did n’t make it a secret that he wanted your job . Now he does n’t have one . ”
204343	204346	204347	204347	I	5148	“ What ? ”
204354	204399	204400	204400	He	5148	“ I ’ve put up with him for a long time , probably too long , but he was with me when I started Innovative , and he stuck with me even when I could n’t pay him a salary for months on end . ”
204437	204465	204419	204419	He	5148	“ I always thought he had the company ’s best interest at heart , but this morning I learned that he ’s a backbiting sack of shit . ”
204466	204469	204470	204470	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
204489	204544	204419	204419	He	5148	“ Damien made some calls after you told him what happened yesterday , and he confirmed that our boy Tanner is the one who told the press you were coming to Innovative . That ’s bad enough — making you deal with that shit — but he also planted that bullshit about corporate espionage . ”
204545	204550	204551	204551	My	5148	“ Oh , no . ”
204558	204564	204551	204551	My	5148	“ He ’s an idiot . ”
204565	204571	204572	204572	Bruce	2092	“ Yes , he is , ”
204576	204585	204586	204586	He	2092	“ And now he ’s an unemployed one . ”
204593	204603	204586	204586	He	2092	“ Do n’t be mad at Damien for interfering . ”
204604	204609	204610	204610	I	5148	“ I ’m not , ”
204651	204669	204685	204685	Bruce	2092	“ Tanner seemed to think that you gave me the job as a favor to your wife . ”
204707	204711	204712	204712	Bruce	2092	“ Did he ? ”
204715	204720	204712	204712	Bruce	2092	“ That ’s odd . ”
204721	204733	204753	204753	he	2092	“ I thought so , too . What did he mean ? ”
204743	204748	204749	204749	he	2092	“ Not a clue , ”
204760	204765	204766	204766	I	5148	“ Oh , well , ”
204770	204777	204766	204766	I	5148	“ Probably just Tanner being Tanner . ”
204778	204786	204787	204787	He	2092	“ I ’m sure that ’s all . ”
204791	204809	204787	204787	He	2092	“ We should probably mingle . I think the rest of the guests are starting to arrive . ”
205516	205521	205522	205525	the guy in purple	243	“ Are you okay ? ”
205528	205531	205532	205532	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
205787	205798	205770	205770	Maynard	0	“ — not listening . This is Germany we ’re — ”
205992	206014	206015	206015	She	882	“ Those two are so funny . And they told me what ’s going to happen on the show next week . ”
206020	206038	206015	206015	She	882	“ If you forget to remind me to set the DVR , I will never forgive you . ”
206039	206043	206044	206044	I	5148	“ Fair enough , ”
206047	206065	206066	206066	she	882	“ You ’re getting pictures , right ? I want to post them on Facebook . Sorry , ”
206070	206079	206066	206066	she	882	“ I know you ’re avoiding social media . ”
206163	206168	206169	206169	I	5148	“ It ’s okay , ”
206172	206182	206183	206183	I	5148	“ And , yeah . I ’ve taken some , ”
206200	206204	206193	206193	She	882	“ You okay ? ”
206245	206253	206254	206254	I	5148	“ It ’s been a strange evening , ”
206257	206264	206229	206229	Jamie	1450	“ Want to talk about it ? ”
206270	206274	206265	206265	I	5148	“ Hell no . ”
206275	206292	206265	206265	I	5148	“ Where ’s lover boy ? Or is that the part we ’re not talking about ? ”
206293	206301	206302	206302	I	5148	“ He ’s doing the host thing . ”
206328	206334	206335	206335	Jamie	1450	“ So who is she ? ”
206369	206374	206375	206375	I	5148	“ That ’s Giselle , ”
206378	206389	206375	206375	I	5148	“ She owns the gallery that sells Blaine ’s work . ”
206390	206409	206431	206435	the whole Hostess Giselle thing	2884	“ Ah . The hostess to Damien ’s host . No wonder you ’re in a pissy mood . ”
206410	206419	206420	206420	I	5148	“ I am not in a pissy mood , ”
206465	206477	206478	206478	She	385	“ I know how to cure your not - pissy mood . ”
206488	206522	206478	206478	She	385	“ Rip and Lyle really are funny . You ’re going to love meeting them . And if you do n’t love it , then at least pretend like you do , okay ? ”
206683	206712	206675	206676	my mother	646	“ A lady is always in control . Never let them see that they ’ve wounded you . Because once you do , they ’ll know your weaknesses . ”
206916	206939	206940	206940	she	5962	“ I do n’t know if I need to wring Damien ’s neck or Giselle ’s for only having wine and champagne , ”
206945	206960	206940	206940	she	5962	“ Come on , Texas , you must know where the secret stash is . ”
206961	206971	206972	206972	I	5148	“ As a matter of fact , I do , ”
207033	207040	207041	207041	she	5962	“ So spill it , Texas , ”
207055	207062	207041	207041	she	5962	“ Something ’s on your mind . ”
207063	207068	207069	207069	I	5148	“ I ’m slipping , ”
207072	207084	207069	207069	I	5148	“ I used to be able to hide my troubles better . ”
207085	207100	207041	207041	she	5962	“ Or maybe it ’s putting on a good face that gives you away . ”
207121	207129	207069	207069	I	5148	“ Come on . Tell Auntie Evelyn . ”
207130	207134	207135	207135	I	5148	“ Tell you ? ”
207138	207153	207135	207135	I	5148	“ I seem to recall there was something I wanted you to tell me . ”
207154	207159	207160	207160	she	5962	“ Oh , hell , ”
207183	207198	207169	207169	She	5962	“ I was just running my mouth off . Do n’t listen to me . ”
207199	207204	207205	207205	I	5148	“ I do listen , ”
207208	207227	207205	207205	I	5148	“ And I do n’t believe you . What ’s going on that I do n’t know about ? ”
207243	207268	207236	207236	she	5962	“ I just hate it when I see a shitstorm coming and know there ’s not a damn thing I can do about it . ”
207269	207272	207236	207236	she	5962	“ Carl ? ”
207279	207321	207273	207273	She	5962	“ Carl can go piss up a rope . No , Damien ’s managed to keep his business private for almost two decades . But that ’s about to end , and I ’m not sure if he even realizes it . ”
207322	207329	207330	207330	I	5148	“ Not much gets past Damien , ”
207344	207365	207366	207366	I	5148	“ But what on earth are you talking about ? He ’s already done damage control on the Padgett scandal , ”
207399	207405	207390	207390	Damien	5148	“ So what else is — ”
207415	207420	207406	207406	I	5148	“ The tennis center . ”
207427	207434	207421	207421	Evelyn	5962	“ What has he told you ? ”
207435	207466	207467	207467	I	5148	“ Pretty much what he told the press . That Richter is an asshole and he ’s not going to the dedication ceremony . He did n’t tell me why , ”
207475	207482	207467	207467	I	5148	“ But I have my suspicions . ”
207490	207499	207483	207483	Evelyn	5962	“ Have you told Damien what you believe ? ”
207500	207503	207504	207504	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
207507	207519	207504	207504	I	5148	“ But he has n’t told me if I ’m right . ”
207569	207583	207563	207563	Her	5962	“ But he has n’t told you you ’re wrong , has he ? ”
207600	207690	207593	207593	she	5962	“ He really has fallen for you , Texas , and I could n’t be happier . For both of you . I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen that boy looking so good . But goddammit , I wish he ’d just show his face at that damn dedication . And I could kick the boy in the nuts for that stunt he pulled last night . He deserves better than to have the press all over his ass like a piranha with a hard - on . ”
207691	207701	207702	207702	I	5148	“ Is it really such a big a deal ? ”
207724	207780	207715	207715	Damien	5148	“ Maybe it was n’t the best move to share with the world that he does n’t like Richter , but all he ’s doing is not showing up to an event . The way he ’s being hounded , you ’d think he turned down an invitation from the Queen and then insulted her . ”
207781	207800	207801	207801	Evelyn	5962	“ All I ’m saying is that sometimes you have to play the game to avoid a shitstorm , ”
207804	207818	207801	207801	Evelyn	5962	“ And now I ’m afraid the storm will hit dead - on . ”
207824	207828	207819	207819	I	5148	“ What shitstorm ? ”
207829	207834	207835	207835	Evelyn	5962	“ You ask Damien , ”
207838	207856	207835	207835	Evelyn	5962	“ As for me , I hope I ’m wrong . But I bet I ’m right . ”
207948	207960	207961	207961	Evelyn	5962	“ But that ’s not what ’s been on your mind , ”
207972	208001	207961	207961	Evelyn	5962	“ Come on , Texas . I ’ve been watching you and Damien all night — and most of the time I have n’t been watching you together . ”
208021	208048	208009	208009	I	5148	“ As far as the cocktail party is concerned , I ’m simply a guest . Damien and Giselle are doing the host and hostess thing . ”
208049	208054	208055	208055	She	5962	“ Uh - huh . ”
208132	208135	208136	208136	I	5148	“ What ? ”
208140	208145	208146	208146	she	5962	“ Not a thing , ”
208149	208164	208146	208146	she	5962	“ Just that I could ’ve sworn your eyes were blue . Not green . ”
208170	208181	208182	208182	I	5148	“ I ’m a bit discombobulated where Giselle is concerned , ”
208185	208204	208182	208182	I	5148	“ She ’s coming at me from all sides lately , and it ’s messing with my head . ”
208300	208315	208316	208316	I	5148	“ Damien did n’t tell me he was helping Giselle bring the paintings back , ”
208319	208333	208316	208316	I	5148	“ And I know that ’s no reason to be jealous . But — ”
208334	208346	208417	208417	Her	2901	“ But now she ’s at his side instead of you ? ”
208347	208381	208316	208316	I	5148	“ Maybe . But that ’s not really fair of me since I ’d be at his side if I had n’t gotten mad and stormed away . Damien ’s giving me space . ”
208382	208416	208417	208417	Her	2901	“ Ah , a lover ’s quarrel . That ’s okay , Texas . The drama always increases in the second act . What dastardly deed did he do to bruise your heart ? ”
208434	208445	208417	208417	Her	2901	“ He told Giselle it ’s me in the painting . ”
208455	208461	208417	208417	Her	2901	“ And she told Bruce . ”
208462	208466	208316	208316	I	5148	“ I see . ”
208477	208512	208469	208469	Evelyn	5962	“ What ? Do you think I should just get over it ? I ’ve been telling myself it ’s not that big a deal , and maybe it is n’t . But Damien — ”
208513	208549	208587	208587	She	5962	“ — broke his word . Yes , of course that would upset you . Would piss me off , too . But in this case , I think you need to forgive the boy . ”
208560	208586	208550	208550	I	5148	“ I will . I honestly ca n’t imagine staying mad at Damien . But not right now . I ’m feeling a little fragile . ”
208598	208615	208587	208587	She	5962	“ You need to forgive him because he did n’t break his word . Blaine did . ”
208616	208619	208620	208620	I	5148	“ What ? ”
208636	208641	208642	208642	Evelyn	5962	“ Blaine told Giselle , ”
208650	208777	208642	208642	Evelyn	5962	“ He did n’t mean to . He was mortified . They were talking about model releases for the gallery and somehow the conversation turned to the portrait . He does n’t even remember what he said , exactly . You know how he gets when he starts chattering . And the next thing you know , he ’d told her . He rushed home and told me the whole story . Did n’t sleep that night — took all my harassing to keep him from calling Damien right then and there , but it was two in the morning , and I told him it could wait . Poor kid looked green until he finally got Damien on the phone at five the next morning . ”
208778	208783	208784	208784	I	5148	“ When was this ? ”
208788	208793	208642	208642	Evelyn	5962	“ Four days ago . ”
208794	208822	208642	208642	Evelyn	5962	“ But — but I asked Damien point - blank if he told Giselle , and he said yes . He was lying for Blaine ? Why ? ”
208823	208908	208642	208642	Evelyn	5962	“ Aw , honey , it was n’t Damien that Blaine was green in the gills about . It was you . He fucked up , and he hurt you , and he fully intended to come clean . He wanted Damien ’s advice on how to tell you , and Damien told him not to . Damien said he ’d talk to Giselle and make sure it did n’t go further , and that if need be , he ’d take the blame . ”
208909	208913	208924	208924	she	2904	“ But why ? ”
208914	208923	208924	208924	she	2904	“ You already answered that one , Texas , ”
208953	208959	208960	208960	I	5148	“ He ’s protecting Blaine , ”
208970	208977	208960	208960	I	5148	“ He ’s protecting our friendship . ”
208993	209004	208960	208960	I	5148	“ You want me to tell Blaine that you know ? ”
209011	209048	209005	209005	I	5148	“ No . No . I do n’t want him to worry that it bothers me or that I ’m mad at him . Maybe someday I ’ll tell him , but right now , no . ”
209049	209059	209060	209060	she	2905	“ I was n’t sure about telling you myself , ”
209063	209070	209060	209060	she	2905	“ I ’m glad I did . ”
209071	209076	209077	209077	I	5148	“ Me , too , ”
209080	209138	209077	209077	I	5148	“ To be honest , I was surprised as hell to see Giselle here . Blaine told her that he did n’t mean to say anything . She must know that showing up would embarrass you and piss off Damien . Hard to believe she ’d go out of her way to piss off her best client . ”
209139	209143	209144	209144	I	5148	“ No kidding , ”
209193	209200	209201	209201	Evelyn	5962	“ Maybe I had it wrong , ”
209204	209214	209201	209201	Evelyn	5962	“ Maybe Giselle ’s the one who ’s jealous . ”
209215	209221	209201	209201	Evelyn	5962	“ Of me ? Why ? ”
209222	209228	209229	209229	Evelyn	5962	“ You ’re with Damien , ”
209232	209241	209229	209229	Evelyn	5962	“ And she ’s not . Not anymore . ”
209249	209257	209229	209229	Evelyn	5962	“ Damien and Giselle used to date ? ”
209258	209285	209201	209201	Evelyn	5962	“ Years ago . They were an item for a few months before she and Bruce tied the knot . Now there ’s an interesting story . ”
209286	209291	209229	209229	Evelyn	5962	“ Damien and Giselle ? ”
209305	209310	209311	209311	Evelyn	5962	“ Giselle and Bruce , ”
209321	209330	209331	209331	She	5962	“ But that ’s dirt for another day . ”
209348	209357	209358	209358	she	5962	“ Ready to head back into the fray ? ”
209363	209366	209367	209367	I	5148	“ No , ”
210123	210136	210137	210137	he	5148	“ I hope this means you are n’t still mad at me , ”
210164	210169	210153	210153	I	5148	“ Should I be ? ”
210203	210209	210210	210210	he	5148	“ I ’m truly sorry , ”
210213	210233	210210	210210	he	5148	“ I did n’t mean for Giselle to know . And I certainly never expected her to tell Bruce . ”
210248	210259	210260	210260	I	5148	“ You are an exceptionally good man , Damien Stark , ”
210274	210293	210267	210267	he	5148	“ No , I ’m not . But every once in a while I do a good thing . ”
210311	210316	210294	210294	He	5148	“ Evelyn told you ? ”
210317	210320	210321	210321	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
210359	210379	210346	210346	he	5148	“ I wish she had n’t done that . I did n’t want you to be upset with Blaine . ”
210380	210404	210405	210405	I	5148	“ I ’m not . I might have been if I ’d learned first that it was him , but you deflected that . ”
210420	210431	210405	210405	I	5148	“ Like I said , you ’re a good man . ”
210432	210458	210483	210483	I	5148	“ I ’m still sorry . And even sorrier that Giselle came early . She was n’t invited , and I know it embarrassed you . ”
210459	210464	210465	210465	I	5148	“ I ’ll survive , ”
210486	210499	210483	210483	I	5148	“ Why did n’t you tell me that you and Giselle dated ? ”
210508	210513	210500	210500	He	5148	“ You never asked . ”
210514	210520	210521	210521	I	5148	“ You knew I wondered , ”
210524	210532	210521	210521	I	5148	“ That night . Our first night . ”
210553	210558	210559	210559	I	5148	“ Dammit , Damien , ”
210569	210633	210533	210533	He	5148	“ Giselle and I went out a few times , but it was long before she and Bruce got married . And if I recall correctly , at the time Giselle came up , I was in the process of seducing you . I did n’t think that outlining my dating history would be conducive to the tone I was trying to set . ”
210652	210656	210657	210657	Damien	5148	“ After that , ”
210660	210686	210687	210687	he	5148	“ the topic never came up again . And there ’s no reason it should . There is only one woman I ’m interested in , ”
210705	210708	210699	210699	He	5148	“ Better ? ”
210709	210712	210713	210713	My	5148	“ Yes . ”
210723	210734	210735	210735	I	5148	“ I do n’t like feeling like a jealous harpy , ”
210738	210774	210735	210735	I	5148	“ But suddenly I ’m being bombarded by Giselle . The painting , the trip back from Palm Springs , what Tanner said , and then finding out that you two actually used to date . ”
210775	210837	210699	210699	He	5148	“ I have no idea what Tanner said or what Palm Springs has to do with anything , but I can assure you that as far as the painting is concerned , Giselle has promised me again that she wo n’t tell anyone that you ’re the model . She can be flighty , but she wo n’t break her word . ”
210838	210845	210735	210735	I	5148	“ You talked to her tonight ? ”
210846	210850	210699	210699	He	5148	“ I did . ”
210851	210864	210865	210865	I	5148	“ Oh . Well , I ’m very glad to hear it , ”
210868	210881	210865	210865	I	5148	“ And I do n’t think Bruce will tell anyone , either . ”
210882	210897	210699	210699	He	5148	“ Do you want me to talk to him ? I have n’t yet . ”
210898	210905	210865	210865	I	5148	“ No . I trust him . ”
210911	210916	210906	210906	Damien	5148	“ What about Tanner ? ”
210947	210965	210944	210944	I	5148	“ He ’s already been fired — thanks for that — but do n’t do anything else . ”
210966	210972	210944	210944	I	5148	“ What would I do ? ”
210973	210981	210982	210982	I	5148	“ Oh , I do n’t know , ”
210992	211020	210982	210982	I	5148	“ Sic the Yakuza on him . Task a satellite to blast him with a laser beam from space . Honestly , what could n’t you do ? ”
211021	211035	210944	210944	I	5148	“ I rather like the laser - beam - from - space idea . ”
211036	211040	210982	210982	I	5148	“ Promise me . ”
211041	211059	210944	210944	I	5148	“ I promise . He ’s out of Innovative and away from you . End of story . ”
211060	211063	211064	211064	I	5148	“ Good , ”
211086	211091	211092	211092	he	457	“ And Palm Springs ? ”
211095	211124	211092	211092	he	457	“ I ’ve always found it to be such a relaxing place . I ’m curious how such a benign location made it onto your list of suspects . ”
211125	211131	210944	210944	I	5148	“ You ’re teasing me . ”
211132	211137	211092	211092	he	457	“ Only a little . ”
211138	211155	210944	210944	I	5148	“ You should have told me you were giving Giselle a ride back in the limo . ”
211156	211159	211160	211160	he	457	“ Oh , ”
211167	211196	211160	211160	he	457	“ Yes , I can see your point . I should have . I would have . If I had given her a ride back in the limo . ”
211228	211274	211225	211225	her	2938	“ But you came back in the limo . I assumed that was because you were giving her and the paintings a lift . But if you were n’t , then why not just come back in the helicopter ? Was n’t that your plan ? ”
211275	211374	211225	211225	her	2938	“ It was . But my meetings ended surprisingly early , and as you ’ve noted so many times , I have a universe to run . It ’s difficult to conduct business from a helicopter . The noise level makes dictation tricky , and I ’ve found that international clients get touchy when they think I ’m shouting at them . Plus , it ’s much easier to make unscheduled stops along the way from a ground vehicle , and when I realized I had the time , I scheduled a few stops in Fullerton and Pasadena . ”
211390	211397	211375	211375	I	5148	“ The point , Mr. Stark ? ”
211398	211471	211225	211225	her	2938	“ The point is that when I realized my schedule was going to change , I called my office to arrange to have the limo sent . My assistant told me that Giselle had called , hoping that I could suggest a transport company in Palm Springs that could arrange the delivery of some paintings for the show . Apparently she decided to bring back more than could fit in her car . ”
211472	211488	211375	211375	I	5148	“ And since you were right there , you offered to bring them back yourself . ”
211489	211493	211494	211494	he	2939	“ The paintings , ”
211497	211514	211494	211494	he	2939	“ Not the woman . As you said , I can be a very nice man . ”
211518	211524	211515	211515	I	5148	“ Yes , you can . ”
211525	211535	211375	211375	I	5148	“ I wonder if I might make a suggestion ? ”
211536	211541	211515	211515	I	5148	“ Um , sure . ”
211542	211570	211375	211375	I	5148	“ Next time you have a question about whether or not I ’m transporting other women in the limo , simply pick up the phone and ask . ”
211571	211574	211575	211575	I	5148	“ Right , ”
211578	211584	211575	211575	I	5148	“ I ’ll do that . ”
211594	211607	211575	211575	I	5148	“ I really am sorry . I ’ve been out of sorts . ”
211608	211613	211614	211614	he	5148	“ As have I , ”
211641	211648	211649	211649	I	5148	“ Will you tell me why ? ”
211673	211685	211653	211653	He	5148	“ I do n’t want what is between us to end . ”
211686	211689	211690	211690	His	5148	“ Oh . ”
211710	211713	211714	211714	I	5148	“ No , ”
211728	211735	211714	211714	I	5148	“ I do n’t , either . ”
211741	211746	211747	211747	he	5148	“ Do n’t you ? ”
211767	211776	211777	211777	I	5148	“ Damien , God , of course not . ”
211794	211864	211865	211865	I	5148	“ Everything feels skewed tonight , as if nothing is the way it ’s supposed to be . This house , even . I ’m so used to coming here . To standing up in front of that balcony and posing for Blaine , and knowing that you ’re watching and that when Blaine leaves it will just be you and me in this house , on that bed . ”
211871	211897	211865	211865	I	5148	“ I love that you thought to give it to me , but it felt so final . As if we were closing a door . ”
211898	211906	211907	211907	he	5148	“ The bed was only a gift , ”
211910	211949	211907	211907	he	5148	“ Something for you to have , to lie on , to think about us . But tonight I thought you wanted to close that door . What was it you said ? No rules , no game ? ”
211950	211955	211956	211956	I	5148	“ I was angry , ”
211959	211975	211907	211907	he	5148	“ I do n’t like the thought that I ’ve hurt you or upset you . ”
211976	211981	211982	211982	I	5148	“ You have n’t , ”
211985	211989	211982	211982	I	5148	“ Not really . ”
211990	211998	211999	211999	His	5148	“ Have n’t I ? I wonder … ”
212024	212027	211982	211982	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
212028	212034	212035	212035	he	5148	“ I watched you tonight , ”
212067	212074	212075	212075	he	5148	“ I could n’t help it , ”
212078	212112	212075	212075	he	5148	“ When you ’re in a room , I have no choice but to watch you . You draw me in . You compel me . And I fall willingly under your spell . ”
212132	212211	212075	212075	he	5148	“ I saw you with Jamie . I watched you talking with Bruce . I heard your laughter as you chatted with those ridiculous television stars . I saw the hurt on your face when you escaped the party with Evelyn . And each smile , each frown , each laugh , and each flash of pain in your eyes were like wounds to me , Nikki , because I was n’t the one sharing them with you . ”
212227	212238	212239	212239	he	5148	“ But this is what wounded me most of all , ”
212265	212269	212250	212250	I	5148	“ You saw ? ”
212312	212319	212302	212302	Damien	5148	“ Will you tell me why ? ”
212398	212408	212409	212409	I	5148	“ I ’ve told you most of it already , ”
212412	212423	212409	212409	I	5148	“ It ’s just been a hell of a day . ”
212424	212434	212435	212435	His	5148	“ All right . Now tell me the rest . ”
212447	212451	212452	212452	I	5148	“ This party , ”
212455	212468	212452	212452	I	5148	“ Seeing Giselle as the hostess . Looking around at unfamiliar furniture . ”
212487	212518	212523	212523	yours	2941	“ I did n’t even recognize the third floor . That room , this house — for so long , they ’ve been ours . But tonight they were n’t . ”
212605	212610	212611	212611	he	2942	“ Come with me , ”
212677	212683	212687	212687	he	2942	“ What are you doing ? ”
212770	212779	212780	212780	he	2942	“ Bradbury ’s one of my favorite writers , ”
212783	212787	212788	212788	He	2942	“ I know . ”
212838	212897	212905	212905	His	2949	“ He lived in Los Angeles , and one day I heard that he was going to be signing books at a store in the Valley . I begged my father to take me , but he ’d scheduled an additional practice with my coach , and neither one of them was willing to cut me a break . ”
212898	212904	212905	212905	His	2949	“ What did you do ? ”
212912	212920	212905	212905	His	2949	“ I went to the signing anyway . ”
212921	212927	212905	212905	His	2949	“ How old were you ? ”
212928	212931	212932	212932	he	2949	“ Eleven , ”
212935	212950	212905	212905	His	2949	“ But how did you get there ? Did n’t you live in Inglewood ? ”
212951	212974	212905	212905	His	2949	“ I told my dad I was going to the courts , hopped on my bike , and headed for Studio City . ”
212975	212990	212905	212905	His	2949	“ At eleven ? In Los Angeles ? It ’s a miracle you survived . ”
212991	212995	212996	212996	he	2949	“ Trust me , ”
213000	213020	212996	212996	he	2949	“ The trip was much less dangerous than my father when he learned what I ’d been up to . ”
213021	213035	212905	212905	His	2949	“ But that ’s an insane distance . You rode all that way ? ”
213036	213077	212996	212996	he	2949	“ It ’s only about sixteen miles . But with the hills and the traffic , it took me longer than I thought it would . So when I realized that I ’d be late , I hitched a ride . ”
213143	213148	213149	213149	he	2362	“ It was close , ”
213152	213160	213149	213149	he	2362	“ But I made it on time . ”
213181	213188	213189	213189	I	5148	“ And you got the books , ”
213199	213312	213189	213189	I	5148	“ Unfortunately , no . I got there during the scheduled time for the signing , but they were all out of books . I decided to ask Bradbury to sign a bookmark instead , so I told him my story and he told me he could do better than a bookmark . Next thing I know , his driver is putting my bike in the trunk of his car and we ’re off to his house . I spent three hours chatting with the man in his living room , then he let me pick two books off his shelf , signed them , and had his driver take me home . ”
213327	213332	213313	213313	I	5148	“ And your dad ? ”
213333	213364	213365	213365	he	5148	“ Never told him . He was pissed as hell , but all I confessed to was taking my bike and riding along the beach . I paid for it , ”
213369	213382	213383	213383	he	5148	“ but I had the books . I still have the books , ”
213391	213395	213396	213396	I	5148	“ You do , ”
213399	213408	213396	213396	I	5148	“ Bradbury sounds like a really nice man . ”
213409	213413	213383	213383	he	5148	“ He was . ”
213414	213421	213422	213422	I	5148	“ This is a wonderful story , ”
213454	213469	213447	213447	Damien	5148	“ But I ’m not sure why you ’re telling it to me now . ”
213470	213522	213523	213523	He	5148	“ Because the things in this house mean something to me . Not the props I had brought in for the party , but the real things . There ’s not much yet , but it ’s all precious to me . The art . Each knickknack . Even the furniture . ”
213545	213572	213523	213523	He	5148	“ You are no exception , Nikki . I brought you to this house because I want you here , just as I wanted your portrait . ”
213578	213584	213573	213573	I	5148	“ What are you saying ? ”
213585	213640	213523	213523	He	5148	“ I ’m saying that I do n’t think you could have made me happier than to say you felt jealous watching Giselle act as hostess of the party . But let ’s be clear . She ’s not the hostess in this house , and she never could be . Do you understand ? ”
213729	213732	213733	213733	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
213764	213767	213768	213768	he	5148	“ No , ”
213771	213776	213768	213768	he	5148	“ Look at me . ”
213853	213858	213859	213859	he	5148	“ You belong here , ”
213862	213877	213859	213859	he	5148	“ Wherever I am , you belong . You ’re mine . Say it . ”
213878	213886	213887	213887	My	5148	“ I am . I am yours . ”
213914	213919	213920	213920	His	5148	“ I need you . ”
213957	213963	213988	213988	he	5148	“ I need you now . ”
213964	213969	213970	213970	I	5148	“ God , yes , ”
213978	213985	213970	213970	I	5148	“ Damien , oh , please . ”
214106	214110	214111	214111	he	5148	“ No panties , ”
214121	214125	214111	214111	he	5148	“ You said — ”
214126	214130	214131	214131	I	5148	“ I lied , ”
214147	214154	214131	214131	I	5148	“ Shut up and kiss me . ”
214155	214171	214111	214111	he	5148	“ Kiss you ? Ms. Fairchild , I ’m going to do more than that . ”
214172	214176	214131	214131	I	5148	“ The party ? ”
214177	214182	214183	214183	he	5148	“ Fuck the party , ”
214186	214192	214131	214131	I	5148	“ If someone comes down — ”
214193	214198	214131	214131	I	5148	“ They wo n’t . ”
214199	214203	214131	214131	I	5148	“ But if — ”
214204	214207	214131	214131	I	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
214208	214211	214131	214131	I	5148	“ Yes ? ”
214212	214215	214131	214131	I	5148	“ Hush . ”
214402	214407	214433	214433	he	5148	“ Damien , please — ”
214408	214412	214433	214433	he	5148	“ Please what ? ”
214413	214420	214433	214433	he	5148	“ Please , please fuck me . ”
214421	214427	214428	214428	he	5148	“ Whatever the lady wants , ”
214719	214722	214723	214723	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
214776	214779	214780	214780	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
214783	214787	214788	214788	I	5148	“ I know , ”
214853	214856	214857	214857	he	5148	“ Here , ”
214880	214885	214886	214886	he	5148	“ Good as new , ”
214889	214892	214893	214893	I	5148	“ Better , ”
214933	214944	214945	214945	he	5148	“ I did n’t like the way I felt today , ”
214949	214962	214945	214945	he	5148	“ Seeing you like that . Knowing you were angry with me . ”
214963	214972	214973	214973	I	5148	“ I did n’t like it , either , ”
214976	214989	214945	214945	he	5148	“ I suppose there ’s something to be said for makeup sex . ”
214990	214993	214945	214945	he	5148	“ Definitely . ”
214999	215025	214994	214994	He	5148	“ I meant what I said , Nikki . I do n’t want this to end . I do n’t want us to be over . ”
215048	215052	215053	215053	I	5148	“ I know , ”
215056	215063	215053	215053	I	5148	“ I do n’t , either . ”
215079	215082	215083	215083	he	5148	“ No , ”
215086	215119	215083	215083	he	5148	“ I need to be clear . I do n’t want our arrangement to end . You ’re mine , and there are rules . And I want our game to continue . ”
215172	215180	215247	215247	I	5148	“ I — I do n’t understand . ”
215181	215246	215251	215251	he	2963	“ I think you do . And I think you want it , too . Tell me , Nikki , did you leave your panties at home because you like the way it feels , or because you like knowing that you ’re open to me ? That I can touch you — that I can fuck you — whenever and wherever I want ? ”
215445	215448	215449	215449	I	5148	“ his , ”
215722	215725	215726	215726	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
215729	215751	215752	215752	I	5148	“ Before , you said that you wanted me . But you have me now , with or without the game . ”
215764	215790	215752	215752	I	5148	“ I ’m still wearing it , Damien . You know I ’ll always wear it . So why ? What difference does it make ? ”
215800	215811	215812	215812	he	5148	“ You say you want me to open up more , ”
215829	215846	215816	215816	I	5148	“ I want that , too . I do n’t want secrets between us , Nikki . ”
215847	215856	215857	215857	I	5148	“ You told me about the tennis center , ”
215860	215864	215865	215865	he	5148	“ Not everything , ”
215880	215895	215896	215896	He	5148	“ I need parameters , Nikki . Especially now . I need to know — ”
215914	215932	215896	215896	He	5148	“ I need to know that you will be here , with me , no matter what . ”
215957	215968	216000	216000	He	5148	“ Do n’t you already know that ? I do . ”
215982	215999	216000	216000	He	5148	“ How can you , when there are still so many things you do n’t know ? ”
216279	216285	216286	216286	he	4993	“ Can you tell me ? ”
216301	216306	216307	216307	I	5148	“ I ’m scared , ”
216310	216314	216307	216307	I	5148	“ Of what ? ”
216315	216319	216320	216320	I	5148	“ Of you , ”
216339	216348	216329	216329	I	5148	“ No , no , not like that . ”
216360	216373	216349	216349	I	5148	“ You are the best thing that has ever happened to me . ”
216374	216380	216329	216329	I	5148	“ That does sound terrifying . ”
216394	216405	216381	216381	I	5148	“ Sometimes I ’m afraid that I ’m using you . ”
216454	216462	216435	216435	he	4993	“ Like a crutch , I mean . ”
216560	216573	216536	216536	I	5148	“ I ’m afraid that you ’re a replacement for the pain . ”
216574	216578	216579	216579	he	4993	“ I see , ”
216707	216710	216717	216717	He	4993	“ Damien ? ”
216711	216716	216717	216717	He	4993	“ Oh , baby . ”
216757	216770	216754	216754	me	5148	“ Tell me — tell me what the pain does for you . ”
216771	216775	216776	216776	I	5148	“ You know , ”
216787	216791	216754	216754	me	5148	“ Humor me . ”
216792	216797	216798	216798	I	5148	“ It grounds me , ”
216809	216819	216798	216798	I	5148	“ It centers me . It gives me strength . ”
216820	216824	216825	216825	He	4993	“ I see . ”
216838	216843	216844	216844	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
216847	216852	216864	216864	his	4993	“ I ’m not . ”
216886	216899	216864	216864	his	4993	“ You humble me , Nikki . Do n’t you see that ? ”
216917	216954	216913	216913	he	4993	“ If I do all those things for you — soothe you , center you , give you strength — then that is worth more to me than every penny I have earned building Stark International . ”
216955	216958	216959	216959	I	5148	“ I — ”
216980	216985	216986	216986	he	4993	“ But , baby , ”
216989	217045	216986	216986	he	4993	“ it ’s not true . The strength is in you . The pain is just your way of mining it . And as for me ? I like to think that I am a mirror for you . That when you look at me , you see the reflection of everything you really are . ”
217084	217093	217094	217094	I	5148	“ You talk as though you love me , ”
217158	217164	217165	217165	he	4993	“ Say yes , baby , ”
217172	217179	217165	217165	he	4993	“ Say that you are mine . ”
217180	217184	217185	217185	I	5148	“ How long ? ”
217375	217378	217379	217379	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
217387	217396	217379	217379	I	5148	“ We have a deal , Mr. Stark . ”
217415	217420	217421	217421	I	5148	“ Oh , dear , ”
217424	217432	217433	217433	He	5148	“ Sweetheart , you have no idea . ”
217440	217444	217433	217433	He	5148	“ Come on . ”
217527	217536	217537	217537	I	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild and I are going out . ”
217549	217570	217542	217542	Gregory	312	“ Of course , Mr. Stark . I ’ll take care of supervising the cleanup and closing out the house . ”
217571	217576	217577	217577	I	5148	“ We ’re leaving ? ”
217594	217598	217599	217599	he	5148	“ We are , ”
217799	217803	217804	217804	he	2099	“ Come here , ”
217835	217848	217826	217826	she	5962	“ Glad I ’m not the only one getting a little tonight . ”
217849	217854	217855	217855	I	5148	“ Only a little ? ”
217865	217873	217874	217874	she	5962	“ And there it is , Texas , ”
217880	217888	217889	217889	She	5962	“ That ’s why I like you . ”
217896	217900	217901	217901	she	5962	“ This week , ”
217904	217919	217901	217901	she	5962	“ Photos and wine and talking trash , and not necessarily in that order . ”
217920	217926	217927	217927	I	5148	“ It ’s a date , ”
217940	217944	217945	217945	Damien	5148	“ Leave it , ”
217954	217963	217945	217945	Damien	5148	“ I promise you wo n’t need it . ”
217964	217970	217971	217971	I	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
217974	217994	217971	217971	I	5148	“ I ca n’t think of a more beautiful sight than you standing naked in front of a window . ”
217995	218008	217945	217945	Damien	5148	“ Are you under the impression there will be nakedness involved tonight ? ”
218009	218024	217971	217971	I	5148	“ I ’m hopeful , Mr. Stark . I ’m very , very hopeful . ”
218081	218087	218088	218088	she	1450	“ Hey , you two , ”
218096	218115	218088	218088	she	1450	“ Louis , this is my roommate , Nikki . I ’m guessing you already know Mr. Stark . ”
218167	218173	218174	218174	she	1450	“ Louis is a director , ”
218178	218187	218188	218188	she	1450	“ We were talking television . Great house , ”
218197	218201	218188	218188	she	1450	“ Greater party . ”
218202	218219	218174	218174	she	1450	“ Glad you think so . Nikki and I just came by to say our goodbyes . ”
218220	218223	218224	218224	She	1450	“ Oh . ”
218239	218250	218251	218251	Damien	5148	“ Edward will take you home whenever you ’re ready , ”
218255	218259	218251	218251	Damien	5148	“ Enjoy yourself . ”
218260	218265	218266	218266	She	1450	“ Cool . Thanks . ”
218300	218310	218311	218311	I	5148	“ So where are we going , Mr. Stark ? ”
218323	218330	218311	218311	I	5148	“ Do you fancy a walk ? ”
218331	218339	218311	218311	I	5148	“ Actually , I fancy a drive . ”
218387	218393	218372	218372	I	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
218394	218402	218372	218372	I	5148	“ Someplace you have n’t seen yet . ”
218403	218408	218409	218409	I	5148	“ Uh - huh . ”
218556	218564	218565	218565	I	5148	“ It ’s so pretty out here , ”
218580	218584	218585	218585	he	5148	“ It is , ”
218595	218603	218604	218604	I	5148	“ Watch the path , Mr. Stark , ”
218607	218614	218618	218618	he	5148	“ I ’d rather watch you . ”
218658	218661	218662	218662	I	5148	“ Here ? ”
218685	218695	218662	218662	I	5148	“ Outside ? On these hard , cold stones ? ”
218754	218769	218740	218740	His	5148	“ What exactly do you want me to do to you , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
218789	218792	218793	218793	he	5148	“ This ? ”
218830	218835	218836	218836	He	5148	“ Or maybe this ? ”
218860	218863	218864	218864	I	5148	“ Maybe , ”
218867	218877	218878	218878	he	5148	“ It would be sweet , would n’t it ? ”
218912	218955	218878	218878	he	5148	“ Here , under the stars . My hands on you and only the night around us . My tongue on your breast , the cool air grazing your erect nipple . A whisper of cool wind brushing over your hot cunt . ”
218980	218987	218995	218995	His	5148	“ Is that what you want ? ”
218988	218991	218992	218992	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
219044	219047	219029	219029	I	5148	“ No . ”
219068	219071	219072	219072	he	5148	“ No , ”
219075	219083	219072	219072	he	5148	“ I have something else in mind . ”
219140	219152	219125	219125	he	5148	“ I ’m thinking of putting in a tennis court there . ”
219166	219169	219153	219153	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
219206	219225	219226	219226	He	5148	“ Maybe . I have n’t decided . It ’s been so long , and I ’m afraid — ”
219239	219248	219249	219249	I	5148	“ — that it wo n’t be fun ? ”
219272	219290	219291	219291	I	5148	“ Well , if you do install a court , you can teach me how to play . ”
219295	219315	219291	219291	I	5148	“ That will ensure that you have fun . I promise . Playing with me will be quite amusing . ”
219316	219319	219320	219320	he	5148	“ Amusing ? ”
219336	219356	219324	219324	I	5148	“ I ’m imagining you in a tennis dress . Amusing is n’t the word that comes to mind . ”
219357	219390	219291	219291	I	5148	“ And will our rules apply then , Mr. Stark ? I ’m not sure how much tennis will get played if I ’m wearing one of those outfits and no underwear . ”
219391	219421	219324	219324	I	5148	“ I ’m intrigued , Ms. Fairchild . I think you may have made up my mind for me . I ’ll start interviewing construction companies in the morning . ”
219422	219426	219427	219427	I	5148	“ Very funny , ”
219430	219435	219436	219436	he	5148	“ You laugh now , ”
219439	219451	219436	219436	he	5148	“ But wait until I take you by the ball cage . ”
219452	219462	219463	219463	He	5148	“ Now you ’re just talking dirty to me . ”
219515	219518	219519	219519	he	5148	“ What ? ”
219527	219534	219522	219522	I	5148	“ I did n’t say anything . ”
219535	219540	219522	219522	I	5148	“ You ’re smiling . ”
219541	219547	219522	219522	I	5148	“ Maybe I ’m happy . ”
219548	219552	219553	219553	he	5148	“ Are you ? ”
219563	219567	219553	219553	he	5148	“ So am I. ”
219568	219571	219572	219572	I	5148	“ Damien . ”
219590	219595	219596	219596	he	5148	“ Ah - ah , ”
219599	219613	219596	219596	he	5148	“ Start that up and we ’ll never get where we ’re going . ”
219614	219636	219596	219596	he	5148	“ So we are going somewhere ? I was beginning to think we were simply taking a hike to Ventura County . ”
219637	219640	219641	219641	he	5148	“ Actually , ”
219644	219649	219650	219650	We	3009	“ we ’re here . ”
219662	219665	219666	219666	I	5148	“ Lovely , ”
219669	219698	219666	219666	I	5148	“ But if you ’re planning to ravage me in the flowers , I should say that I would have been just as happy on the stone path . ”
219699	219709	219710	219710	he	5148	“ I ’ll make a note for future reference , ”
219713	219722	219710	219710	he	5148	“ But this is n’t our final destination . ”
219723	219726	219666	219666	I	5148	“ Oh ? ”
219795	219799	219787	219787	I	5148	soundtrack—“Ode to Joy , ”
219930	219965	219923	219923	I	5148	“ You have got to be kidding me . You ’ve barely finished the actual house , and yet you have a fully tricked out , fifteen - car garage hidden in the hillside ? ”
219966	219979	219980	219980	he	5148	“ I did n’t want a detached garage to mar the landscape , ”
219983	220031	219980	219980	he	5148	“ Although to be fair the garage has been on the property long before the house . I built this three years ago while my architect was working out the plans for the residence . And just to clarify , it ’s a twenty - car garage . ”
220039	220068	220032	220032	I	5148	“ All this space in the hills and only twenty ? And detached from the house ? Seriously , Mr. Stark , what happens if it ’s raining ? ”
220069	220076	220077	220077	he	5148	“ I use the tunnel access , ”
220095	220097	220077	220077	he	5148	“ Residence ”
220103	220111	220112	220112	I	5148	“ You really are a walking cliché , ”
220120	220125	220126	220126	he	5148	“ Not at all , ”
220129	220136	220137	220137	He	5148	“ I ’m a driving one . ”
220159	220167	220168	220168	I	5148	“ What kind of car is this ? ”
220212	220218	220219	220219	he	5148	“ A Gardner touring car , ”
220222	220233	220219	220219	he	5148	“ But come here , this is my real prize . ”
220260	220266	220267	220267	he	5148	“ A Baker Electric car , ”
220270	220279	220267	220267	he	5148	“ Thomas Edison actually owned this very automobile . ”
220280	220283	220284	220284	I	5148	“ Seriously ? ”
220289	220297	220284	220284	I	5148	“ That should be in a museum . ”
220298	220307	220308	220308	he	5148	“ I offer it on loan quite often , ”
220311	220369	220308	220308	he	5148	“ But not permanently . I do n’t see the point of owning extraordinary toys if I ca n’t have them around to enjoy . Just as I do n’t see the point of having money and not using it to acquire interesting things , if not for myself , then for the people I care about . ”
220392	220411	220370	220370	I	5148	“ Fortunately for those of us who are the recipients of your magnanimity , you have excellent taste . ”
220412	220420	220421	220421	He	5148	“ Indeed I do , Ms. Fairchild . ”
220427	220441	220421	220421	He	5148	“ Come on . I ’ll show you our ride for the night . ”
220475	220479	220480	220480	I	5148	“ All right , ”
220488	220495	220480	220480	I	5148	“ Tell me all about it . ”
220508	220515	220516	220516	he	5148	“ Jaguar E - Type Roadster , ”
220549	220560	220561	220561	I	5148	“ I hope there wo n’t be a pop quiz , ”
220564	220583	220561	220561	I	5148	“ Because I did n’t catch anything but the name and the fact that I ’m very impressed . ”
220584	220589	220590	220590	he	5148	“ That ’ll do , ”
220593	220599	220561	220561	I	5148	“ Did you rebuild it ? ”
220600	220607	220561	220561	I	5148	“ What makes you think that ? ”
220608	220629	220561	220561	I	5148	“ Edward told me about the Bentley . I ca n’t quite imagine you all covered in grease and oil . ”
220630	220635	220636	220636	he	5148	“ That ’s funny , ”
220645	220671	220636	220636	he	5148	“ I have no trouble at all imagining you naked and slick with oil , spread out on a bed just waiting to be fucked . ”
220672	220675	220676	220676	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
220679	220682	220676	220676	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
220825	220828	220829	220829	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
220832	220865	220829	220829	he	5148	“ This is how I want you . Hot and wet and on fire for me . I want you fuckable , Nikki . Anytime , anyplace , I want you ready . ”
220866	220874	220875	220875	I	5148	“ I ’m always ready for you , ”
220892	220899	220900	220900	he	5148	“ I should fuck you now , ”
220931	221008	220929	220929	him	5148	“ I should bend you over the hood of this car and lift your skirt and spank your ass until it ’s red and throbbing . Then I should thrust my cock into your sweet , wet cunt . Is that what you want , Nikki ? You can tell me . Tell me all the things you want me to do to you , Nikki . Tell me how you want me to fuck you . ”
221055	221059	221060	221060	he	5148	“ Tell me , ”
221063	221071	221072	221072	I	5148	“ I want you to fuck me , ”
221075	221106	221072	221072	I	5148	“ I want your hands on my tits and your cock deep inside me . I want you , Damien . Please , please , I want you so badly . ”
221214	221218	221219	221219	he	5148	“ Thank you , ”
221228	221231	221232	221232	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
221235	221242	221232	221232	I	5148	“ Dammit , Damien , please . ”
221243	221249	221219	221219	he	5148	“ Frustrated , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
221250	221256	221232	221232	I	5148	“ You know I am . ”
221257	221260	221219	221219	he	5148	“ Good . ”
221276	221283	221219	221219	he	5148	“ Now , into the car . ”
221332	221351	221314	221314	He	5148	“ Legs apart , Ms. Fairchild . You do n’t get off until I say you get off . ”
221363	221375	221352	221352	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , but I did n’t hear you . ”
221376	221381	221352	221352	I	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
221382	221386	221352	221352	I	5148	“ Good girl . ”
221525	221531	221511	221511	I	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
221532	221536	221537	221537	he	5148	“ Just wait , ”
221625	221635	221636	221636	I	5148	“ You ’re really not going to tell me ? ”
221723	221735	221702	221702	Damien	5148	“ Are we going into LA ? It ’s almost eleven . ”
221736	221754	221707	221707	he	5148	“ I ’m afraid I ’m going to keep you up past your bedtime , Ms. Fairchild . ”
221805	221814	221796	221796	I	5148	“ Eyes on the road , Mr. Stark . ”
221815	221822	221823	221823	he	5148	“ I ’d rather watch you , ”
221846	221851	221852	221852	he	5148	“ That ’s better , ”
221864	221869	221870	221870	I	5148	“ Like the view ? ”
221893	221904	221878	221878	he	5148	“ I ’ll like it even better in a minute . ”
221914	221917	221905	221905	I	5148	“ Oh ? ”
221918	221930	221931	221931	he	5148	“ I saw the way you were admiring Blaine ’s work , ”
221935	221941	221905	221905	I	5148	“ He ’s very talented . ”
221942	221976	221905	221905	I	5148	“ The way he can portray arousal , shame , sexual longing . There are some at the gallery that show a woman in the throes of an orgasm . Spectacular , really . ”
221977	221984	221985	221985	I	5148	“ I have n’t seen those , ”
221988	221997	221905	221905	I	5148	“ Which one was your favorite this evening ? ”
221998	222004	222005	222005	I	5148	“ I liked them all , ”
222008	222042	222005	222005	I	5148	“ Did you ? I thought I saw a note of particular interest on your face when you looked at the woman on the chaise . Do you know the one I mean ? ”
222043	222046	222047	222047	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
222073	222079	222080	222080	he	5148	“ What was she doing ? ”
222083	222087	222088	222088	I	5148	“ Touching herself , ”
222091	222104	222088	222088	I	5148	“ Her lover off to one side . Her legs bound open . ”
222105	222108	222109	222109	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
222117	222123	222124	222124	he	5148	“ Take your shoes off , ”
222137	222162	222163	222163	he	5148	“ Lift your skirt up around your waist . I want you bare against the leather . Oh , God , Nikki , yes , ”
222197	222212	222213	222213	His	5148	“ Spread your legs , baby . Just like the woman in the painting . ”
222358	222385	222429	222429	He	5148	“ She lies there , silently begging for her lover . Her cunt is slick , her breasts tender , her nipples begging to be sucked . ”
222386	222391	222429	222429	He	5148	“ Damien , please … ”
222392	222401	222402	222402	Damien	5148	“ He does n’t touch her , though , ”
222413	222428	222402	222402	Damien	5148	“ He leaves her like that , a breeze blowing on her aching cunt . ”
222461	222506	222429	222429	He	5148	“ If he were kind , he ’d let her touch herself , but if you look closely at the painting , you see that her hand is in the air , wanting , but not reaching . Did you notice that , Nikki ? ”
222507	222510	222511	222511	I	5148	“ No , ”
222515	222524	222511	222511	I	5148	“ I ’m certain she was touching herself . ”
222525	222552	222429	222429	He	5148	“ Are you ? Well , that ’s the thing about art . It ’s different for everybody . Shall I tell you what I see ? ”
222558	222632	222553	222553	I	5148	“ I see the man who is not in the portrait . The woman means everything to him . And nothing can please him more than to bring her pleasure . And not just a quick fuck and a fast orgasm , Nikki . No , he wants to create their own nirvana . To build pleasure upon pleasure until the lines cross and neither is sure if it ’s torment or delight . ”
222668	222723	222724	222724	He	3042	“ He wants his lover to trust him . To surrender herself to him completely . To let him orchestrate the pleasures of her body . But he leaves the ultimate choice up to her . He lets her have one hand free , and that is the moment Blaine captured on the canvas . ”
222739	222756	222724	222724	He	3042	“ And so the question is , does she touch herself or does she trust him ? ”
222772	222785	222724	222724	He	3042	“ You tell me , Nikki . What does the woman do ? ”
222786	222791	222792	222792	I	5148	“ She trusts him , ”
222821	222826	222827	222827	Damien	5148	“ We ’re here , ”
222841	222844	222845	222845	I	5148	“ Here ? ”
222868	222876	222877	222877	he	5148	“ Tug your skirt down , baby , ”
222880	222891	222877	222877	he	5148	“ Unless you want to give the valet a treat . ”
222930	222938	222954	222954	he	5148	“ We ’re checking into a hotel ? ”
222945	222949	222950	222950	he	5148	“ You are , ”
222978	222987	222988	222988	he	5148	“ I ’m just dropping off the lady , ”
222997	223002	222992	222992	I	5148	“ What are we — ”
223003	223007	223008	223008	he	5148	“ Go register , ”
223011	223048	223008	223008	he	5148	“ Do n’t worry , you already have a reservation . And I suggest a drink . Take a seat at the bar . It ’s a beautiful venue and the bartender makes an excellent martini . ”
223111	223116	223117	223117	I	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
223129	223134	223135	223135	I	5148	“ Wait a minute , ”
223173	223181	223182	223182	I	5148	“ Tip the young man , darling , ”
223268	223277	223251	223251	I	5148	“ I ’m checking in . Nikki Fairchild . ”
223296	223316	223278	223278	He	3053	“ I see that you ’re in our penthouse suite . Can I have someone take up your luggage ? ”
223317	223324	223325	223325	I	5148	“ Thank you , but no . ”
223336	223342	223278	223278	He	3053	“ One key or two ? ”
223343	223347	223348	223348	I	5148	“ Just one , ”
223585	223597	223602	223616	a nice - looking man who sits one seat over from me at the bar	225	“ You look distracted . Anything I can help you with ? ”
223658	223667	223668	223669	The bartender	772	“ No , thanks . I ’m fine . ”
223750	223756	223757	223757	he	225	“ Here for the conference ? ”
223770	223773	223774	223774	I	5148	“ No , ”
223777	223786	223774	223774	I	5148	“ I ’m looking for some time alone . ”
223787	223791	223793	223800	the man who can not take a hint	225	“ Lucky you , ”
223802	223813	223793	223800	the man who can not take a hint	225	“ Insurance regulations . Hours and hours of continuing education . ”
223814	223817	223818	223818	I	5148	“ Hmm , ”
223878	223891	223892	223892	he	225	“ I can think of better ways to spend a late night , ”
223903	223916	223892	223892	he	225	“ And we are in a hotel . You do the math . ”
223917	223926	223927	223927	I	5148	“ I was never particularly good at math , ”
223961	223975	223976	223977	the man	225	“ You look like you ’d be good at a lot of things , ”
224004	224009	224010	224010	he	225	“ From the gentleman , ”
224017	224021	224022	224022	I	5148	“ How nice , ”
224099	224108	224094	224094	I	5148	“ Thank you for the drink . Sir . ”
224136	224144	224130	224130	He	5148	“ I hope you like dirty martinis . ”
224145	224151	224152	224152	I	5148	“ The dirtier the better , ”
224155	224171	224130	224130	He	5148	“ Hey . You want to get lost ? I was chatting with the lady . ”
224177	224180	224181	224181	he	5148	“ No , ”
224184	224195	224172	224172	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t think so . I want her . ”
224208	224216	224204	224204	he	5148	“ The lady wants to be alone . ”
224226	224230	224231	224231	He	5148	“ Does she ? ”
224244	224258	224231	224231	He	5148	“ Did you come here to be alone ? Or to be fucked ? ”
224259	224262	224263	224263	I	5148	“ I — ”
224285	224297	224277	224278	the guy	5148	“ I guess that depends on who ’s doing the fucking , ”
224302	224308	224309	224309	Damien	5148	“ I like your answer , ”
224312	224318	224309	224309	Damien	5148	“ What ’s your name ? ”
224319	224322	224323	224323	I	5148	“ Louise , ”
224338	224355	224335	224335	Damien	5148	“ Nice to meet you , Louise . I want you to come with me now . ”
224369	224372	224356	224356	I	5148	“ I — ”
224373	224376	224377	224377	He	5148	“ Now . ”
224420	224425	224426	224426	he	5148	“ Maybe next time , ”
224595	224600	224601	224601	he	5148	“ God , Louise , ”
224609	224623	224605	224605	we	3075	“ I thought someone might recognize us . It ’s my middle name . ”
224624	224628	224629	224629	he	5148	“ I know , ”
224632	224650	224629	224629	he	5148	“ And I think they were all too tipsy to care . And too out of town . ”
224651	224659	224605	224605	we	3075	“ Could have been some paparazzi around . ”
224660	224665	224666	224666	Damien	5148	“ Fuck the paparazzi , ”
224683	224690	224676	224676	I	5148	“ I ’d rather fuck you . ”
224698	224705	224706	224706	I	5148	“ That man was very disappointed , ”
224715	224741	224742	224742	He	5148	“ Just claiming what ’s mine . And adding in the public service of giving that man a fantasy to keep him occupied this evening . ”
224766	224777	224752	224752	I	5148	“ Do n’t tell me you did n’t like it . ”
224778	224783	224784	224784	I	5148	“ I liked it , ”
224795	224802	224784	224784	I	5148	“ I liked it very much . ”
224871	224894	224928	224928	My	5148	“ For a woman who likes to be mine , you were certainly doing an excellent job of flirting with that man . ”
224973	224992	224963	224963	I	5148	“ What was I supposed to do ? You were ignoring me . I was just making conversation . ”
224993	225000	225001	225001	He	502	“ He wanted more than conversation . ”
225046	225062	225063	225063	he	502	“ You need to understand how completely you belong to me . Mine to pleasure , ”
225080	225086	225087	225087	He	502	“ Or mine to torment . ”
225113	225118	225119	225119	he	502	“ You like that ? ”
225137	225142	225122	225123	Dear God	229	“ Spread your legs . ”
225256	225267	225238	225238	his	502	“ You want to be fucked , do n’t you ? ”
225268	225271	225272	225272	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
225413	225419	225420	225420	he	502	“ Turn around , baby , ”
225423	225431	225420	225420	he	502	“ I want to see your face . ”
225477	225481	225482	225482	I	5148	“ Kiss me , ”
225581	225584	225585	225585	he	502	“ Now , ”
225724	225727	225728	225728	I	5148	“ Wow , ”
225738	225741	225742	225742	he	502	“ Indeed , ”
225760	225767	225768	225768	I	5148	“ This table is really uncomfortable , ”
225778	225799	225768	225768	I	5148	“ I think we need to clean it up , too . I ’m not sure the maids will understand . ”
225800	225811	225812	225812	he	502	“ I ’m sure they ’ve seen it all before , ”
225826	225829	225830	225830	he	502	“ Right , ”
225833	225851	225830	225830	he	502	“ We ’ll take care of it . But now , I ’m taking you to bed . ”
225879	225883	225884	225884	I	5148	“ A mattress , ”
225887	225891	225884	225884	I	5148	“ How novel . ”
225892	225896	225897	225897	He	502	“ Come here . ”
225991	225997	225998	225998	I	5148	“ I ’m not tired , ”
226010	226031	225998	225998	I	5148	“ I ’d say that I ’m going to regret this in the morning , but it already is morning . ”
226032	226036	226037	226037	he	502	“ Will you ? ”
226045	226052	226053	226053	I	5148	“ Not a minute of it , ”
226056	226060	225998	225998	I	5148	“ Thank you . ”
226061	226065	225998	225998	I	5148	“ For what ? ”
226066	226072	225998	225998	I	5148	“ For indulging my fantasies . ”
226076	226093	226073	226073	I	5148	“ Why , Mr. Stark . Have n’t you heard ? I ’m yours to command . ”
226099	226108	226094	226094	He	502	“ And I ’m very , very glad . ”
226123	226141	226120	226120	Damien	5148	“ That phone call you asked about earlier . It was bad news . From a friend . ”
226142	226145	226146	226146	I	5148	“ Oh , ”
226149	226154	226146	226146	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry . ”
226162	226169	226146	226146	I	5148	“ Is the friend in Germany ? ”
226177	226184	226170	226170	He	0	“ Why would you say that ? ”
226188	226194	226185	226185	I	5148	“ Charles ’s voice carries . ”
226195	226207	226170	226170	He	0	“ So it does . No , Germany ’s something different . ”
226208	226221	226185	226185	I	5148	“ An indictment ? One of your Stark International subsidiaries or something ? ”
226233	226237	226230	226230	he	0	“ Or something . ”
226238	226243	226170	226170	He	0	“ Are you worried ? ”
226244	226247	226230	226230	he	0	“ No . ”
226253	226259	226230	226230	he	0	“ Charles is handling it . ”
226286	226300	226276	226276	I	5148	“ Do you want to tell me about your friend ’s bad news ? ”
226333	226338	226316	226316	he	0	“ It ’s Sofia . ”
226349	226360	226316	226316	he	0	“ Your friend from childhood ? The one Alaine mentioned ? ”
226364	226401	226361	226361	He	0	“ She ’s gotten herself into some trouble . It ’s not the first time , but it ’s frustrating . I keep hoping she ’ll get her shit together , but she keeps screwing up . ”
226402	226415	226361	226361	He	0	“ I ’m sorry . I hope it gets better for her . ”
226421	226426	226416	226416	He	0	“ Me , too . ”
226453	226457	226448	226448	I	5148	“ Thank you . ”
226468	226473	226474	226474	he	0	“ I am trying , ”
226477	226483	226484	226484	I	5148	“ I know you are . ”
226494	226500	226484	226484	I	5148	“ And I appreciate it . ”
226553	226561	226544	226544	his	0	“ I never used to sleep naked . ”
226562	226566	226567	226567	I	5148	“ Why not ? ”
226590	226624	226632	226632	I	5148	“ Because when we traveled , Richter would come into my room . Somehow , I was always assigned a room of my own , even though the other boys had to share . ”
226653	226657	226648	226648	he	0	“ What happened ? ”
226658	226670	226671	226671	His	0	“ He would come in . And he would touch me . ”
226680	226737	226671	226671	His	0	“ He would threaten me and swear that if I told anyone , that everything I had would be ripped away . And my father would have no money , and we ’d starve on the street . But mostly , I would have the reputation of a little boy who told nasty , nasty lies . ”
226738	226741	226800	226800	I	5148	“ Bastard . ”
226742	226745	226671	226671	His	0	“ Yes . ”
226794	226799	226800	226800	I	5148	“ I thought so , ”
226806	226817	226800	226800	I	5148	“ But I guess I was wrong about your dad . ”
226818	226824	226800	226800	I	5148	“ What do you mean ? ”
226825	226847	226800	226800	I	5148	“ I assumed he knew that your coach was abusing you . I realized in the limo that he did n’t . ”
226867	226871	226858	226858	Damien	5148	“ He knew . ”
226880	226911	226872	226872	I	5148	“ What ? But … but why on earth would he expect you to be at the tennis center dedication if he knows what that vile man did to you ? ”
226912	226918	226919	226919	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
226932	226935	226936	226936	he	5148	“ No , ”
226939	226967	226936	226936	he	5148	“ I do know . The tennis center is owned by a sports conglomerate based out of Germany . Powerful company , powerful people on the board . ”
226968	226982	226872	226872	I	5148	“ I do n’t understand . Is your father involved with the conglomerate ? ”
226983	227033	226936	226936	he	5148	“ No . And my father could n’t care less whether I endorse a tennis center or a pet store . It ’s all about trading favors . I lend my name to the tennis center , and maybe those powerful people will pull a few strings in Germany . ”
227034	227042	226872	226872	I	5148	“ The indictment I keep hearing about ? ”
227043	227092	226936	226936	he	5148	“ Right . Charles agrees with my dad , actually . He ’s pissed as hell at me for making that statement outside Garreth Todd ’s party , even though I reminded him that the longer the whole thing drags on , the more billable hours he earns . ”
227098	227128	227093	227093	He	3093	“ To be honest , I should have kept my mouth shut . I ’m not accustomed to acting rashly , and it was rash to make that statement . ”
227129	227134	226872	226872	I	5148	“ Why did you ? ”
227135	227170	227093	227093	He	3093	“ Because it ’s the truth . Because that center should n’t be named after him . And because I ’m tired of the world thinking that I admired that son of a bitch . ”
227171	227179	226872	226872	I	5148	“ Then you did the right thing . ”
227180	227193	227093	227093	He	3093	“ Maybe . But sometimes even the right thing has unpleasant consequences . ”
227194	227200	226872	226872	I	5148	“ It ’s that bad ? ”
227206	227217	226872	226872	I	5148	“ One of your companies is in that much trouble ? ”
227221	227231	227232	227232	he	3093	“ It has the potential to be very bad , ”
227236	227258	227232	227232	he	3093	“ But I do n’t think it will get that far . I still have a few strings left to pull . ”
227278	227282	227283	227283	he	3093	“ Come here , ”
227387	227390	227395	227395	his	3093	“ Damien ? ”
227461	227465	227449	227449	me	5148	“ Room service ! ”
227474	227479	227480	227480	I	5148	“ Just a sec , ”
227570	227576	227577	227577	he	5148	“ Good morning , madam , ”
227719	227726	227712	227712	Damien	5148	“ Will there be anything else ? ”
227727	227730	227731	227731	I	5148	“ No , ”
227734	227748	227731	227731	I	5148	“ Thank you . Do I need to sign a check or something ? ”
227749	227762	227763	227763	He	5148	“ No , ma’am . But I do have this for you . ”
227785	227797	227773	227773	He	5148	“ Mr. Stark asked that this be delivered with your breakfast . ”
227798	227801	227802	227802	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
227811	227815	227802	227802	I	5148	“ Thank you . ”
228341	228344	228345	228345	I	5148	“ Hi , ”
228348	228361	228345	228345	I	5148	“ Hi , yourself . What have you done so far today ? ”
228362	228366	228367	228367	I	5148	“ Very little , ”
228370	228376	228367	228367	I	5148	“ It ’s been heaven . ”
228377	228395	228345	228345	I	5148	“ Would you object to going out ? I have someplace I ’d like to take you . ”
228396	228401	228367	228367	I	5148	“ Yeah ? Where ? ”
228402	228408	228409	228409	he	5148	“ Rollerblading on Venice Beach , ”
228427	228430	228367	228367	I	5148	“ Really ? ”
228431	228442	228453	228453	Damien	5148	“ It ’s fun . Have you ever done it ? ”
228464	228475	228476	228476	I	5148	“ In that case , I have the perfect accessories . ”
228499	228514	228476	228476	I	5148	“ The more we look like tourists , the less anyone will recognize us . ”
228515	228528	228567	228567	Damien	5148	“ Not to mention the fact that you look pretty damn cute . ”
228616	228621	228622	228622	he	5148	“ Leave everything else , ”
228625	228634	228607	228607	he	5148	“ Do n’t we have to check out ? ”
228635	228641	228642	228642	he	5148	“ It ’s my room , ”
228645	228668	228642	228642	he	5148	“ Well , the company ’s . We keep this suite permanently leased for visiting clients and execs from out of town . ”
228759	228768	228769	228769	I	5148	“ I told you I ’d be horrible , ”
228772	228778	228779	228779	he	5148	“ You were pretty bad , ”
228782	228798	228779	228779	he	5148	“ I ’m not sure how someone so graceful can actually have no balance whatsoever . ”
228799	228804	228805	228805	I	5148	“ I can balance , ”
228808	228822	228805	228805	I	5148	“ Just not on tiny little lines of wheels . What about bicycles ? ”
228837	228846	228828	228828	I	5148	“ Yes . I can ride a bike . ”
228911	228919	228920	228920	Damien	5148	“ Another missing piece of your childhood , ”
228930	228954	228920	228920	Damien	5148	“ That ’s okay . I ’d rather one day biking with you on the beach than an entire summer as a kid . ”
228955	228967	228920	228920	Damien	5148	“ For that , I ’ll buy you an ice cream . ”
229122	229135	229136	229136	Damien	5148	“ Considering how often I traveled , it was for the best , ”
229139	229151	229136	229136	Damien	5148	“ The poor dog would have been kenneled all the time . ”
229152	229193	229194	229194	Damien	5148	“ But was n’t that the point ? You were telling your dad you wanted the dog because you wanted off the circuit . You wanted home . You wanted the dog . And you did n’t want the traveling . ”
229203	229206	229207	229207	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
229211	229217	229207	229207	he	5148	“ That was it exactly . ”
229218	229239	229194	229194	Damien	5148	“ Did you ever get a dog ? Once you quit tennis and became Mr. Business Dude , I mean . ”
229240	229243	229244	229244	he	5148	“ No , ”
229252	229259	229260	229260	He	5148	“ No , I never have . ”
229267	229275	229260	229260	He	5148	“ Think she ’ll sell me hers ? ”
229276	229284	229260	229260	He	5148	“ I ’m gon na say no . ”
229394	229411	229412	229412	I	5148	“ One , I do n’t think they ’d even let us in dressed like this , ”
229415	229431	229412	229412	I	5148	“ And two , it ’s not exactly the best place to avoid the paparazzi . ”
229432	229440	229441	229441	he	5148	“ Pizza by the slice it is , ”
229459	229472	229473	229473	I	5148	“ There ’s no way The Ivy could be better than this , ”
229504	229517	229493	229493	I	5148	“ It ’s getting dark . Should we take the bikes back ? ”
229518	229521	229522	229522	Damien	5148	“ Soon , ”
229525	229533	229522	229522	Damien	5148	“ I want to show you something . ”
229554	229563	229545	229545	I	5148	“ But have you ridden the Ferris wheel ? ”
229564	229567	229568	229568	I	5148	“ No , ”
229571	229579	229568	229568	I	5148	“ Is that where we ’re going ? ”
229580	229594	229545	229545	I	5148	“ Man of mystery , remember ? I ca n’t share my secrets . ”
229595	229604	229568	229568	I	5148	“ I ’ll take that as a yes . ”
229605	229622	229545	229545	I	5148	“ That ’s one of the things I most admire about you . Your cunning intellect . ”
229762	229768	229769	229769	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
229772	229778	229779	229779	I	5148	“ Do n’t let go ! ”
229821	229828	229829	229829	I	5148	“ Why are n’t we moving ? ”
229832	229840	229841	229841	Damien	5148	“ Passengers are loading and unloading below , ”
229880	229886	229908	229908	He	5148	“ You brought me gifts ? ”
229887	229891	229892	229892	he	5148	“ I did , ”
229899	229907	229895	229895	I	5148	“ I did n’t get you anything . ”
229917	229925	229908	229908	He	5148	“ I charged those to your room . ”
229926	229943	229944	229944	He	5148	“ It ’s the thought that counts . But if you do n’t want the gifts … ”
229954	229959	229960	229960	I	5148	“ No , no , ”
229963	229969	229960	229960	I	5148	“ It ’s all good . ”
229976	229982	229983	229983	he	5148	“ The small one first , ”
230030	230037	230038	230038	he	5148	“ You ’ve had the fondue , ”
230041	230049	230038	230038	he	5148	“ But the truffles are our specialty . ”
230050	230054	230055	230055	I	5148	“ Your company ? ”
230058	230064	230055	230055	I	5148	“ The one in Switzerland ? ”
230065	230078	230038	230038	he	5148	“ I told you I ’d have Sylvia order some for you . ”
230097	230102	230092	230092	I	5148	“ Want a bite ? ”
230108	230115	230103	230103	He	5148	“ They ’re all for you . ”
230151	230155	230156	230156	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
230159	230166	230156	230156	I	5148	“ You really do amaze me . ”
230167	230174	230193	230193	He	5148	“ Because I bought you chocolates ? ”
230175	230178	230179	230179	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
230183	230192	230179	230179	I	5148	“ And so many other reasons as well . ”
230205	230210	230193	230193	He	5148	“ Now this one . ”
230283	230292	230293	230293	I	5148	“ Oh , Damien . It ’s amazing , ”
230310	230318	230296	230296	My	5148	“ How did you get the picture ? ”
230319	230328	230329	230329	he	5148	“ Called the paper and bought a print , ”
230332	230352	230329	230329	he	5148	“ You look exceptionally lovely in that photo . I suppose that means the paparazzi are good for something . ”
230353	230361	230362	230362	I	5148	“ I would n’t go that far , ”
230369	230379	230362	230362	I	5148	“ But this , this I will always cherish . ”
230441	230454	230455	230455	he	5148	“ I thought you could put it on your desk at work , ”
230458	230462	230463	230463	I	5148	“ I will , ”
230466	230476	230463	230463	I	5148	“ Then I can look at us every day . ”
230509	230517	230518	230518	I	5148	“ It ’s the best gift ever , ”
230526	230537	230518	230518	I	5148	“ And it ’s been a great day , too . ”
230677	230688	230668	230668	I	5148	“ Welcome to your second day . All settled in ? ”
230689	230706	230707	230707	I	5148	“ All I need now is access to the network and I ’m good to go . ”
230717	230743	230707	230707	I	5148	“ Carla said she ’d have me in the system by the end of the hour , so I guess I ’ll be official soon . ”
230835	230866	230832	230832	Bruce	2092	“ I know I promised you a first - day lunch , but it turns out I have to meet with my attorney . Would you mind if we postpone ? ”
230867	230890	230832	230832	Bruce	2092	“ Do n’t worry about it . To be honest , I ’m pumped to get caught up with all this reading . ”
230931	230943	230924	230924	his	2092	“ I feel like I should apologize again for Saturday night . ”
230944	230947	230948	230948	I	5148	“ No , ”
230962	230970	230948	230948	I	5148	“ It ’s not necessary . Truly . ”
230980	230996	230971	230971	He	2092	“ Well , I hope that ’s not why you and Damien cut out early . ”
231009	231030	230997	230997	I	5148	“ It ’s not . And please tell Giselle that it ’s okay . I promise I ’m not upset . ”
231035	231046	231047	231047	he	2092	“ If I see her , I ’ll tell her , ”
231097	231106	231085	231085	He	2092	“ Have you seen this week ’s issue ? ”
231161	231186	231150	231150	I	5148	“ This has been in the works for a while . Looks like they got it out of beta testing earlier than they anticipated . ”
231187	231205	231206	231206	he	2092	“ I heard through the grapevine that you were working on something similar at C - Squared , ”
231215	231219	231220	231220	I	5148	“ I was , ”
231258	231274	231220	231220	I	5148	“ I was on the team that pitched the C - Squared product to Damien . ”
231275	231283	231310	231310	I	5148	“ Is that how you two met ? ”
231284	231287	231288	231288	I	5148	“ No , ”
231291	231309	231288	231288	I	5148	“ We actually met years ago in Texas . We reconnected at one of Evelyn ’s parties . ”
231355	231399	231426	231426	Bruce	2092	“ At any rate , the pitch went great , but Damien declined to invest because he knew about this Israeli product , though he did n’t say his reason at the time . By then , he and I had gone out . ”
231408	231411	231426	231426	Bruce	2092	“ gone out ”
231438	231444	231426	231426	Bruce	2092	“ And Carl blamed you . ”
231445	231450	231451	231451	I	5148	“ And fired me , ”
231458	231470	231451	231451	I	5148	“ He ’s not high up on my favorite people list . ”
231471	231488	231426	231426	Bruce	2092	“ To be honest , Carl Rosenfeld is n’t high on anyone ’s favorite people list . ”
231617	231621	231622	231622	I	5148	“ Insurance paperwork , ”
231723	231726	231727	231727	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
231730	231761	231727	231727	I	5148	“ It ’s me . Thanks so much for the scarf . It suits me perfectly . How on earth did you know ? I had a great time yesterday , ”
231772	231803	231762	231762	I	5148	“ And I thought you might want to know — I’m wearing a denim skirt , a purple T - shirt under a denim jacket , and absolutely nothing else . ”
231877	231887	231888	231888	he	2092	“ I ’m going down to grab a sandwich , ”
231891	231895	231888	231888	he	2092	“ Want anything ? ”
231896	231901	231902	231902	He	2092	“ Alex , right ? ”
231905	231912	231902	231902	He	2092	“ Mind if I tag along ? ”
231913	231940	231902	231902	He	2092	“ Oh . Well , sure . Okay . Yeah . I mean , I ’m just gon na get something downstairs and bring it back . ”
231941	231947	231948	231948	I	5148	“ Sounds perfect to me . ”
232061	232069	232070	232070	he	2092	“ So you ’re dating Damien Stark , ”
232083	232088	232070	232070	he	2092	“ That ’s cool . ”
232089	232094	232095	232095	I	5148	“ I think so , ”
232163	232174	232175	232175	Alex	443	“ Yeah , so the sandwiches here are pretty good , ”
232188	232197	232175	232175	Alex	443	“ The pizza kind of sucks , though . ”
232198	232201	232175	232175	Alex	443	“ Salads ? ”
232202	232206	232207	232207	he	443	“ Beats me , ”
232210	232223	232207	232207	he	443	“ I do n’t do rabbit food . Meet you back here ? ”
232281	232292	232274	232274	she	3174	“ Innovative , right ? You ’re the new girl . ”
232293	232297	232298	232298	I	5148	“ Nikki Fairchild , ”
232301	232330	232298	232298	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , I ’ve been introduced to about a million people , at least it feels that way . I do n’t remember your name . ”
232331	232364	232274	232274	she	3174	“ No , no , we have n’t met . I work in the building . Lisa Reynolds . I ’m a business consultant , and I ’ve known Bruce for years . ”
232374	232383	232384	232384	I	5148	“ You were in the lobby on Friday , ”
232387	232394	232384	232384	I	5148	“ At one of the tables . ”
232395	232424	232425	232425	she	3175	“ I usually am at least once a day . I ca n’t live without coffee , and I like to get out of the office . Here , ”
232438	232455	232425	232425	she	3175	“ If you ever want to sneak downstairs for a latte , give me a shout . ”
232456	232459	232460	232460	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
232588	232591	232592	232592	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
232595	232605	232592	232592	I	5148	“ Did you see that article in Tech World ? ”
232606	232613	232585	232585	Damien	5148	“ Talking shop , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
232617	232663	232614	232614	I	5148	“ What else should I talk about ? The scarf you sent me ? Your skill at picking out gifts has become a little rusty , but I guess there is some logic . If I already own it , I probably already like it . ”
232664	232671	232672	232672	he	443	“ You make a good point , ”
232675	232711	232672	232672	he	443	“ I ’ll keep that in mind for future gifts , too . At the moment , though , I was hoping to talk about the very interesting piece of correspondence I received this morning . ”
232739	232749	232750	232750	he	443	“ Are you in an office or a cubicle ? ”
232753	232757	232758	232758	I	5148	“ An office , ”
232774	232803	232737	232737	my	5148	“ In that case , my dear Ms. Fairchild , I think you should close your door . For that matter , I think you should lock it . ”
232804	232812	232813	232813	I	5148	“ Damien , I ’m at work , ”
232823	232881	232737	232737	my	5148	“ What a coincidence . So am I. Imagine my surprise as I ’m reviewing my morning mail . Requests to speak at business conferences . Investment opportunities . Real estate proposals . All intriguing opportunities , but none so enticing as what I find when I open a simple letter sent on my very own stationery . ”
232882	232885	232737	232737	my	5148	“ Damien … ”
232886	232937	232737	232737	my	5148	“ You have a way with words , Ms. Fairchild . I was quite relieved that my assistant was at her desk when I read your letter . I do n’t know that I would have been able to hide my erection . You really are quite a little minx . ”
232942	232946	232938	232938	My	5148	“ A minx ? ”
232947	232958	232959	232959	he	5148	“ I can still remember the sound of your voice , ”
232962	233017	233018	233018	He	5148	“ so smooth I almost came just from the sound of it . And the cool leather against the hot skin of my ass . Even then , I wanted your hands on me , your cock inside me . I barely knew you , and yet I wanted to submit to you utterly . ”
233021	233033	233018	233018	He	5148	“ Yes , I think minx is a very accurate description . ”
233034	233037	233039	233039	my	5148	“ Oh . ”
233053	233058	233047	233047	I	5148	“ I was inspired . ”
233059	233118	233018	233018	He	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear it . When I ran across the scarf in the apartment this morning it reminded me of you , and after I got your letter , I thought that I should return it right away . You see , we did n’t really let that scarf live up to its potential . ”
233119	233124	233125	233125	My	5148	“ We did n’t ? ”
233130	233133	233134	233134	he	5148	“ No , ”
233139	233202	233134	233134	he	5148	“ But I intend to make up for that . There are a lot of things one can do with a scarf . A lot of things one can do with fringe . The delicate brush over your erect nipple . A teasing stroke over your hot cunt . I promise you that we ’ll fully explore all of the various possibilities . ”
233203	233206	233207	233207	I	5148	“ Um . ”
233210	233225	233207	233207	I	5148	“ Wear it today and think about what I ’ll do with it tonight . ”
233226	233229	233230	233230	I	5148	“ Tonight ? ”
233245	233254	233255	233255	he	5148	“ I ’ll pick you up at seven , ”
233258	233267	233255	233255	he	5148	“ I ’ll have you naked by eight . ”
233342	233345	233334	233334	he	2664	“ Nikki . ”
233364	233376	233355	233355	I	5148	“ We do n’t have anything to say to each other . ”
233377	233380	233381	233381	he	2664	“ Wait , ”
233384	233387	233381	233381	he	2664	“ Please . ”
233392	233395	233397	233397	I	5148	“ please , ”
233419	233423	233424	233424	I	5148	“ Two minutes , ”
233535	233553	233582	233582	Ya	3188	“ Dammit , Nikki , I did n’t know there was any other company in that market . ”
233554	233563	233564	233564	My	5148	“ What is it you want , Carl ? ”
233569	233581	233564	233564	My	5148	“ I just — well , I may have acted rashly . ”
233604	233617	233564	233564	My	5148	“ It ’s just that , I thought you were fucking Stark . ”
233659	233663	233652	233652	I	5148	“ I am . ”
233669	233719	233664	233664	Carl	2664	“ Right , right . I mean , yeah , I ’ve seen the pictures of you two and all that . It ’s just that , well , I thought you had a fight . Or that maybe Stark thought that you and I had a thing going . ”
233720	233734	233664	233664	Carl	2664	“ I promise you he thinks much more highly of me than that . ”
233735	233747	233664	233664	Carl	2664	“ Dammit , Nikki , I ’m trying to apologize here . ”
233748	233756	233757	233757	I	5148	“ Is that what this is about ? ”
233762	233782	233783	233783	He	2664	“ I fucked up , okay ? I was stupid and I blew the whole thing out of proportion . ”
233805	233815	233783	233783	He	2664	“ I acted rashly , and I ’m sorry . ”
233832	233846	233816	233816	I	5148	“ We ’re talking about more than firing me , are n’t we ? ”
233853	233861	233816	233816	I	5148	“ What did you do , Carl ? ”
233862	233873	233816	233816	I	5148	“ Oh , hell . Other shit . You know . ”
233874	233880	233881	233881	I	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
233884	233904	233881	233881	I	5148	“ All you said was that you were going to fuck Damien over . So what did you do ? ”
233937	233950	233978	233978	He	2664	“ Dammit , Carl . What other shit are you talking about ? ”
233959	233977	233951	233951	He	2664	“ For Christ ’s sake , Carl , why did you come here in the first place ? ”
233986	234007	233978	233978	He	2664	“ You know how Stark paid Padgett off , right ? And now Padgett has to keep his mouth shut . ”
234008	234015	234016	234017	Eric Padgett	1751	“ How do you know that ? ”
234075	234147	234210	234210	He	5148	“ I know a lot of things . Padgett did a lot of talking before he got Stark ’s money . And most of his talking was to other people with an ax to grind against Stark . Trust me when I say that I realized pretty fast that Padgett was the least of Stark ’s worries . There are a lot of people who want to see the shit fly . ”
234148	234152	234153	234153	I	5148	“ You included , ”
234156	234199	234210	234210	He	5148	“ Not me . Not anymore . That ’s why I ’m here . I get it . I got the whole thing wrong and I screwed Damien and I screwed you . I ’m saying I ’m not the only one . ”
234200	234209	234210	234210	He	5148	“ Who , then ? And what shit ? ”
234215	234228	234210	234210	He	5148	“ Just tell Stark that he may not see this one coming . ”
234238	234260	234229	234229	He	5148	“ I was blown away when I learned who Padgett had lined up with an ax to grind against your boyfriend . ”
234276	234284	234266	234266	He	5148	“ You wo n’t tell me who ? ”
234285	234325	234261	234261	I	5148	“ I ’ve said everything I ’m going to . I ’ve played my part , and now I ’m getting out of this mess . Whatever happens is n’t coming from me , I can promise you that . ”
234326	234336	234266	234266	He	5148	“ Then why did you come here at all ? ”
234337	234362	234261	234261	I	5148	“ Because telling you is like telling Stark . It ’s a small world , and I burned a bridge I should n’t have . ”
234363	234374	234266	234266	He	5148	“ And you think this is going to fix it ? ”
234375	234386	234387	234387	He	5148	“ No , but I think it ’s a start . ”
234392	234400	234387	234387	He	5148	“ Tell Stark to watch his back . ”
234401	234407	234408	234408	I	5148	“ I ’ll tell him , ”
234421	234427	234408	234408	I	5148	“ But he always does . ”
234536	234542	234543	234543	I	5148	“ I ran into Carl , ”
234548	234553	234554	234554	His	5148	“ Ran into him ? ”
234566	234581	234554	234554	His	5148	“ As in he came to Innovative and waited for me in the lobby . ”
234582	234592	234644	234644	I	5148	“ Are you okay ? What did he do ? ”
234593	234598	234599	234599	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
234614	234626	234599	234599	I	5148	“ He wanted me to tell you to watch your back . ”
234627	234643	234644	234644	I	5148	“ Did he ? Tell me everything he said , exactly how he said it . ”
234659	234669	234599	234599	I	5148	“ And he would n’t tell you any more ? ”
234670	234673	234674	234674	I	5148	“ No , ”
234677	234689	234674	234674	I	5148	“ Do you have any idea what he ’s talking about ? ”
234756	234768	234751	234751	he	5148	“ I think this is Carl ’s way of blowing smoke . ”
234769	234776	234777	234777	I	5148	“ Why would he do that ? ”
234780	234805	234751	234751	he	5148	“ You said he wants to rebuild burned bridges . What better way to do that than to warn me about some upcoming danger ? ”
234806	234821	234822	234822	I	5148	“ Because there ’s always some sort of danger for a man like you , ”
234833	234895	234751	234751	he	5148	“ An angry competitor . A fired employee . A stolen patent . And then Carl comes along and tells me to be on guard , and when I next notice some nefarious deed , I will think , oh , is n’t it lucky that Carl warned me . I guess the little prick is n’t so bad after all . ”
234922	234930	235013	235013	He	5148	“ So you ’re really not worried ? ”
234931	234941	234942	234942	Damien	5148	“ I make it a point not to worry , ”
234945	234953	234942	234942	Damien	5148	“ There ’s no profit in it . ”
234954	234957	235013	235013	He	5148	“ Damien — ”
234958	234961	234962	234962	he	5148	“ Stop , ”
234966	234970	235013	235013	He	5148	“ Stop what ? ”
234971	234983	235013	235013	He	5148	“ Stop worrying about me . You ’re wasting precious energy . ”
234984	234995	234996	234996	I	5148	“ What else am I going to do with it ? ”
235000	235012	234996	234996	I	5148	“ It ’s not as if you ’re here beside me . ”
235016	235020	235021	235021	he	5148	“ Good girl , ”
235024	235029	235021	235021	he	5148	“ Where are you ? ”
235030	235047	235013	235013	He	5148	“ The parking lot . I ’m going to hit the grocery store and go home . ”
235048	235062	235021	235021	he	5148	“ Good . Can you do me a favor and pick up some — ”
235272	235281	235268	235268	they	3200	“ Nikki ! Nikki , look over here ! ”
235282	235289	235268	235268	they	3200	“ Was the portrait completely nude ? ”
235290	235301	235268	235268	they	3200	“ Does it have the usual Blaine elements like bondage ? ”
235343	235361	235268	235268	they	3200	“ Why did you do it , Nikki ? Was it for the money or the thrill ? ”
235362	235385	235302	235302	I	5148	“ Nikki ! Can you confirm that you accepted a million dollars from Damien Stark to pose nude for an erotic painting ? ”
235422	235430	235302	235302	I	5148	“ Have you ever posed nude before ? ”
235431	235445	235415	235415	I	5148	“ Is the painting a reflection of your sex life with Damien Stark ? ”
235446	235456	235302	235302	I	5148	“ Why did you agree to be tied up ? ”
235768	235771	235772	235772	he	5148	“ Baby , ”
235798	235801	235802	235802	I	5148	“ Please , ”
235805	235813	235802	235802	I	5148	“ Let ’s get out of here . ”
235852	235868	235847	235847	he	5148	“ I ’m so sorry . The painting . The money . I never thought — ”
235869	235872	235879	235879	I	5148	“ No . ”
235882	235898	235879	235879	I	5148	“ Later . Right now , I want to pretend that it did n’t happen . ”
235935	235940	235941	235941	he	5148	“ Who did this ? ”
235944	235951	235941	235941	he	5148	“ Who the fuck leaked this ? ”
236049	236054	236055	236055	Damien	5148	“ Look at me , ”
236121	236124	236125	236125	I	5148	“ Carl , ”
236128	236138	236125	236125	I	5148	“ This is what he was warning me about . ”
236139	236149	236227	236227	Damien	5148	“ Maybe , but I do n’t think so . ”
236150	236154	236125	236125	I	5148	“ Who then ? ”
236155	236163	236227	236227	Damien	5148	“ Does Ollie know about the painting ? ”
236164	236167	236125	236125	I	5148	“ No ! ”
236188	236191	236192	236192	I	5148	“ No , ”
236196	236218	236192	236192	I	5148	“ And even if he did , he ’d keep quiet . I ’m not the one he wants to hurt . ”
236219	236226	236227	236227	Damien	5148	“ Do n’t be so sure , ”
236288	236294	236295	236295	I	5148	“ Who does n’t matter , ”
236303	236309	236295	236295	I	5148	“ It ’s out there . ”
236333	236339	236340	236340	I	5148	“ How did you know ? ”
236344	236382	236310	236310	Damien	5148	“ Jamie . She ’s home . Apparently she had to push through them , too , and they were asking her about the painting . She pretended not to have a clue , then called you . ”
236383	236389	236390	236390	I	5148	“ My phone ’s dead , ”
236394	236431	236390	236390	I	5148	“ I know . She called me when she could n’t reach you , and I tried you , too . When I could n’t get you on the phone to tell you to stay away — ”
236432	236440	236466	236466	He	5148	“ You came to rescue me yourself . ”
236441	236457	236390	236390	I	5148	“ Fortunately I was in Beverly Hills and you made a stop before going home . ”
236458	236462	236463	236463	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
236482	236489	236490	236490	he	5148	“ I will always protect you , ”
236493	236497	236490	236490	he	5148	“ But this — ”
236588	236591	236592	236592	he	5148	“ Goddammit ! ”
236869	236875	236876	236876	I	5148	“ It will be okay , ”
236899	236903	236904	236904	he	5148	“ Screw okay , ”
236965	236973	236974	236974	he	5148	“ None of this should be happening , ”
236977	237043	236974	236974	he	5148	“ I should be able to protect you . I should be able to keep my bastard of a father out of my life and out of my car . I do n’t want him or his shit near me , and I sure as hell do n’t want it near you . And as for the rest of it all over the goddamn globe — ”
237067	237086	237087	237087	he	5148	“ I should be able to keep your secrets as well as my own . But then again , ”
237094	237104	237105	237105	He	5148	“ that ’s crashing down , too . Goddammit . ”
237124	237127	237128	237128	I	5148	“ Well , ”
237131	237145	237128	237128	I	5148	“ That ’s going to need more than a broom and a dustpan . ”
237280	237285	237286	237286	I	5148	“ Tie me up , ”
237289	237319	237286	237286	I	5148	“ Spank me . Tell me exactly what you want me to do . Do whatever you want . You want to lash out ? Lash out against me . ”
237320	237323	237277	237277	his	5148	“ Nikki — ”
237324	237342	237343	237343	I	5148	“ Please , Damien . You ca n’t control the world ? So what ? Control me . ”
237348	237351	237352	237352	I	5148	“ Please , ”
237364	237367	237368	237368	I	5148	“ Please , ”

237379	237384	237385	237385	He	5148	“ Oh , Nikki . ”
237400	237403	237404	237404	he	5148	“ Need ? ”
237407	237411	237404	237404	he	5148	“ Or want ? ”
237427	237453	237454	237454	I	5148	“ You told me once that if I ever needed the pain that I should come to you . I ’ve broken that promise twice . ”
237468	237499	237454	237454	I	5148	“ So yes , Damien . I need it . I need you if I ’m going to get through this . And I think you need me , too . ”
237517	237533	237509	237509	he	5148	“ I believe I told you on the phone that I had plans for this . ”
237534	237537	237538	237538	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
237872	237878	237837	237837	I	5148	“ Take off your clothes . ”
237976	237981	237982	237982	he	0	“ Spread your legs , ”
238043	238046	238047	238047	he	0	“ No , ”
238050	238061	238062	238062	he	0	“ Cup your breasts . There you go , baby , ”
238068	238077	238062	238062	he	0	“ Stroke your nipples . Are they hard ? ”
238078	238081	238082	238082	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
238085	238088	238089	238089	he	0	“ Good , ”
238092	238126	238089	238089	he	0	“ I want them harder . I want them so tight that just brushing a fingertip across your nipple shoots fire all the way down to your cunt . What do you say ? ”
238127	238134	238150	238150	he	0	“ Yes . Yes , sir . ”
238266	238271	238272	238272	he	5148	“ You taste amazing , ”
238295	238305	238306	238306	he	5148	“ I ’m going to fuck you , Nikki , ”
238309	238375	238306	238306	he	5148	“ Right here , right now . Hard and fast , until pleasure rips through you like a cyclone . And then we ’ll start again , slow and easy , letting it build and grow like a tiny seedling into a massive tree . Do you know how long that takes , Nikki ? Can you imagine a pleasure that lasts for an eternity ? ”
238387	238393	238382	238382	I	5148	“ With you , yes . ”
238397	238406	238394	238394	He	5148	“ Good answer . Now unfasten my jeans . ”
238407	238412	238382	238382	I	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
238485	238489	238490	238490	he	5148	“ Good girl , ”
238493	238508	238490	238490	he	5148	“ Now take it out and turn around . On your knees , Nikki . ”
238509	238514	238515	238515	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
238749	238752	238753	238753	he	5148	“ Minx , ”
238760	238765	238766	238766	he	5148	“ Oh , no , ”
238769	238778	238766	238766	he	5148	“ You are not getting off that easily . ”
239029	239034	239035	239035	Damien	5148	“ On your knees , ”
239179	239182	239183	239183	I	5148	“ Handcuffs ? ”
239186	239194	239183	239183	I	5148	“ Are you going to arrest me ? ”
239195	239198	239199	239199	He	5148	“ Maybe . ”
239221	239226	239199	239199	He	5148	“ But not yet . ”
239288	239291	239292	239292	he	5148	“ Want ? ”
239295	239299	239292	239292	he	5148	“ And need ? ”
239300	239303	239304	239304	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
239354	239357	239358	239358	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
239438	239441	239442	239442	I	5148	“ Again , ”
239456	239463	239442	239442	I	5148	“ Please , Damien , again . ”
239523	239528	239529	239529	he	5148	“ Spread your legs , ”
239569	239580	239581	239581	he	5148	“ I ’m going to spank your cunt , too , ”
239584	239604	239581	239581	he	5148	“ And then I ’m going to fuck you , because dammit , Nikki , I ca n’t wait . ”
239692	239695	239696	239696	I	5148	“ Please , ”
239699	239706	239696	239696	I	5148	“ Please , Damien , now . ”
239785	239790	239791	239791	he	5148	“ Come for me , ”
239801	239806	239807	239807	he	5148	“ Come for me , ”
239810	239822	239807	239807	he	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki , I want to feel you come . ”
239923	239927	239928	239928	he	5148	“ Turn over , ”
239934	239942	239928	239928	he	5148	“ I want to show you something . ”
239970	239973	239974	239974	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
239978	239984	239974	239974	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
239985	239989	239962	239962	he	5148	“ Something new . ”
240018	240024	239990	239990	He	5148	“ Do you trust me ? ”
240025	240028	240029	240029	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
240053	240056	240057	240057	he	5148	“ Liar , ”
240060	240065	240057	240057	he	5148	“ Close your eyes . ”
240089	240092	240093	240093	he	5148	“ Relax , ”
240096	240103	240093	240093	he	5148	“ Easy for you to say . ”
240104	240111	240093	240093	he	5148	“ Tell me what this is . ”
240124	240128	240112	240112	I	5148	“ Your finger ? ”
240129	240133	240093	240093	he	5148	“ And this ? ”
240145	240149	240142	240142	my	5148	“ Your tongue . ”
240150	240153	240112	240112	I	5148	“ This ? ”
240164	240170	240180	240180	he	5148	“ I do n’t know . ”
240171	240175	240176	240176	he	5148	“ A feather , ”
240189	240193	240142	240142	my	5148	“ And this ? ”
240240	240246	240209	240209	my	5148	“ I — the candle ? ”
240247	240255	240256	240256	I	5148	“ Very good . Now hold still . ”
240350	240355	240356	240356	he	5148	“ Open your eyes , ”
240669	240674	240675	240675	I	5148	“ Are we celebrating ? ”
240689	240693	240694	240694	he	5148	“ We are , ”
240697	240714	240694	240694	he	5148	“ After the day we had yesterday , I thought we should celebrate the important things . ”
240715	240719	240720	240720	I	5148	“ The day ? ”
240738	240744	240732	240732	I	5148	“ What about the night ? ”
240745	240755	240756	240756	he	5148	“ That was a celebration in and of itself , ”
240838	240846	240826	240826	He	5148	“ I like you in my clothes . ”
240847	240852	240853	240853	I	5148	“ Me , too , ”
240856	240866	240826	240826	He	5148	“ I like you out of them as well . ”
240880	240887	240888	240888	I	5148	“ Do n’t even get ideas , ”
240891	240896	240888	240888	I	5148	“ I ’m starving . ”
240900	240908	240897	240897	He	5148	“ So what exactly are we celebrating ? ”
240918	240921	240909	240909	He	5148	“ Us . ”
240932	240939	240940	240940	I	5148	“ I ’ll drink to that , ”
240943	240959	240909	240909	He	5148	“ Good . You can pour the OJ into our glasses . Then go sit . ”
240972	241003	240960	240960	He	5148	“ If you stay back here you ’ll only distract me , and while that might lead to very interesting kitchen sex , it would also undoubtedly burn the omelettes . ”
241004	241009	241010	241010	I	5148	“ I am hungry , ”
241054	241063	241049	241049	Damien	5148	“ I did n’t know you could cook . ”
241064	241073	241074	241074	he	5148	“ I ’m a man of many mysteries , ”
241077	241084	241085	241085	I	5148	“ I ’m a terrible cook , ”
241088	241114	241085	241085	I	5148	“ There ’s not much point in learning when your mother is convinced that all you really need to eat are carrots and iceberg lettuce . ”
241115	241133	241134	241134	Damien	5148	“ After my mother died , my father would drag us out to restaurants for every meal , ”
241137	241194	241134	241134	Damien	5148	“ I could n’t stand being that close to the man for that long , so I told him that if he expected me to be more competitive , I needed to eat better . I cooked , then took my plate to my room and he took his to the television . Worked out great . ”
241195	241203	241204	241204	I	5148	“ And you learned a valuable skill . ”
241258	241264	241265	241265	I	5148	“ Did you have friends ? ”
241268	241286	241265	241265	I	5148	“ When you were competing , I mean . Did you make friends with the other players ? ”
241287	241297	241298	241298	He	3234	“ Other than Alaine and Sofia ? Not really . ”
241320	241326	241265	241265	I	5148	“ Tell me about Sofia . ”
241332	241346	241327	241327	His	3234	“ We had a lot in common . Both our fathers were assholes . ”
241347	241355	241327	241327	His	3234	“ Are we talking friend or girlfriend ? ”
241356	241366	241327	241327	His	3234	“ Friend , then girlfriend , then friend again . ”
241380	241386	241387	241387	I	5148	“ Was she your first ? ”
241394	241424	241387	241387	I	5148	“ Yes . But it was n’t a moment of joy and bliss for either one of us . We were young , and we definitely were n’t ready . ”
241425	241441	241448	241448	he	3234	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to bring up a difficult subject . ”
241442	241447	241448	241448	he	3234	“ It ’s okay , ”
241467	241470	241471	241471	He	3234	“ Really . ”
241493	241496	241471	241471	He	3234	“ Well ? ”
241514	241524	241497	241497	I	5148	“ This is amazing . What ’s in it ? ”
241525	241528	241501	241501	he	3234	“ Lobster . ”
241529	241540	241497	241497	I	5148	“ You just happen to have lobster in your fridge ? ”
241541	241544	241545	241545	he	3234	“ Sure , ”
241550	241555	241545	241545	he	3234	“ Do n’t you ? ”
241556	241581	241497	241497	I	5148	“ Not hardly . Apparently the cars , hotels , jets , and chocolate factories are n’t the only perks of being filthy rich . ”
241662	241667	241668	241668	she	1450	“ Holy fucking crap , ”
241676	241679	241668	241668	she	1450	“ hello . ”
241680	241696	241697	241697	she	1450	“ Douglas just came over to tell me that you ’re all over the Internet , ”
241700	241710	241711	241711	she	1450	“ Like I did n’t already know . Douglas ! ”
241774	241781	241782	241782	I	5148	“ So it ’s really everywhere ? ”
241785	241793	241782	241782	I	5148	“ I have n’t wanted to look . ”
241794	241797	241798	241798	she	1450	“ Sorry , ”
241807	241814	241798	241798	she	1450	“ Your mom even called me . ”
241815	241818	241782	241782	I	5148	“ You ? ”
241819	241857	241798	241798	she	1450	“ Lucky me , huh ? She said she was too upset to talk with you yet , but that she — oh , fuck , Nikki . What the hell do you care what she thinks ? ”
241858	241865	241866	241866	I	5148	“ I know what she thinks , ”
241869	241892	241866	241866	I	5148	“ That I ’m a disappointment . That I ’ve ruined the family name . That she did n’t raise a whore . ”
241975	241983	241946	241946	she	646	“ So it ’s all over everywhere ? ”
241984	241987	241988	241988	Jamie	1450	“ Yeah , ”
241991	242043	241988	241988	Jamie	1450	“ They do n’t waste any time . The tabloids , social media , even the legitimate news , too . You get a million dollars from a guy like Damien for posing nude and even CNN is going to be reporting it . I mean , talk about the ratings . ”
242044	242047	241946	241946	she	646	“ Jamie . ”
242048	242069	241988	241988	Jamie	1450	“ Sorry ! Sorry ! So , are you okay ? I mean , what are you going to do ? ”
242070	242075	242076	242076	I	5148	“ I ’m okay , ”
242104	242110	242111	242111	I	5148	“ For now , anyway . ”
242178	242187	242188	242188	she	646	“ You ’re staying in today , right ? ”
242191	242203	242204	242204	Damien	5148	“ I ca n’t . I have to go to work . ”
242209	242219	242204	242204	Damien	5148	“ Take the day off . Bruce will understand . ”
242220	242225	242226	242226	Jamie	1450	“ I heard that , ”
242229	242260	242204	242204	Damien	5148	“ Listen to Damien . He ’s smart . And you need to call Bruce before you go to the office , anyway . He called here looking for you . ”
242261	242273	242226	242226	Jamie	1450	“ I ’ll call him , but I ’m going in . ”
242312	242317	242318	242318	he	2092	“ I ’m sorry , ”
242321	242369	242318	242318	he	2092	“ but this is more than a few photographers looking for a photo of Damien Stark ’s girlfriend . They ’re swarming around this story . And I ca n’t have the press hanging around the building trying to get a shot of you . Not now . ”
242370	242373	242374	242374	I	5148	“ Now ? ”
242377	242384	242374	242374	I	5148	“ What ’s special about now ? ”
242394	242430	242387	242387	him	2092	“ Giselle and I are getting a divorce . I have n’t wanted to mention it before , but the point is that I need to be squeaky clean , and my lawyer thinks that — ”
242431	242436	242437	242437	I	5148	“ I get it , ”
242440	242445	242437	242437	I	5148	“ I ’m fired . ”
242446	242451	242452	242452	he	2092	“ Leave of absence , ”
242455	242458	242452	242452	he	2092	“ Please . ”
242459	242482	242437	242437	I	5148	“ It ’s shaping up to be a crappy day , Bruce . Can we at least call it what it is ? ”
242491	242541	242452	242452	he	2092	“ I really am sorry , Nikki . It ’s a lovely portrait and it ’s unfair you ’re getting this kind of blow - back . And I really could use a talent like yours here at Innovative . But you ’re going to land on your feet . ”
242542	242545	242546	242546	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
242553	242557	242546	242546	I	5148	“ I know . ”
242558	242571	242572	242572	Damien	5148	“ I think I ’m going to take the day off today , ”
242581	242590	242591	242591	I	5148	“ You do n’t need to coddle me . ”
242610	242616	242591	242591	I	5148	“ Go . Earn money . ”
242617	242646	242647	242647	He	5148	“ I ’m in the fortunate position of having made enough excellent investment choices that I do n’t have to actually do anything in order to make money . ”
242658	242666	242647	242647	He	5148	“ There . Did you hear that ? ”
242667	242670	242591	242591	I	5148	“ What ? ”
242671	242685	242647	242647	He	5148	“ The clink of coins as I just earned a few thousand more . ”
242691	242711	242686	242686	I	5148	“ I ’m serious . If you take the day off , I ’ll just feel like a burden . ”
242712	242719	242591	242591	I	5148	“ Maybe Switzerland . Or Greece . ”
242720	242723	242686	242686	I	5148	“ Damien . ”
242724	242754	242591	242591	I	5148	“ Hawaii ’s nice , too , and I actually have a house there . We talked about getting sushi the other night . We could go to Japan . ”
242760	242781	242755	242755	I	5148	“ I think if I want sushi we can just go to that little place on Sunset that we like . ”
242782	242833	242686	242686	I	5148	“ Fair enough . But I ’m serious about the vacation . Reporters are like sharks . Once the chum is out of the water , they go away . There will be a new scandal by Monday , and you can come back to a much calmer Los Angeles . ”
242857	242869	242870	242870	I	5148	“ I ran from Texas to get away from my mother , ”
242873	242903	242904	242904	I	5148	“ I ran to LA because this was the place I wanted to start a new life . I picked it . I ’m here . I ’m staying . ”
242907	242924	242904	242904	I	5148	“ Like you said , it ’ll blow over . I ’ll keep a low profile . ”
242935	242938	242925	242925	Damien	5148	“ What ? ”
242939	242986	242925	242925	Damien	5148	“ You ’ve been tossed in with the sharks , and yet you ’re digging in your heels and facing them . If you ever tell me again that you ’re not strong , I ’m going to turn you over my knee and spank you . ”
242987	242992	242993	242993	I	5148	“ Promises , promises , ”
243002	243024	242993	242993	I	5148	“ If you ’re determined to take time off , too , then I thought of something we can do today . ”
243033	243047	243048	243048	he	5148	“ I can think of all sorts of things we can do today , ”
243051	243055	243056	243056	I	5148	“ Not that , ”
243059	243076	243056	243056	I	5148	“ Although I have a feeling what I have in mind gets you hard , too . ”
243077	243082	243083	243083	he	5148	“ How you tease , ”
243086	243098	243083	243083	he	5148	“ So tell me , how are we spending our day ? ”
243099	243102	243103	243103	I	5148	“ Well , ”
243106	243116	243103	243103	I	5148	“ I was hoping we could talk about money . ”
243117	243125	243126	243126	Damien	5148	“ It really depends on your goals , ”
243209	243217	243218	243218	I	5148	“ The million is for my business , ”
243221	243247	243218	243218	I	5148	“ You already know that , but I want to make sure we ’re clear . I do n’t want the million to go away . ”
243248	243252	243253	243253	he	5148	“ The principal , ”
243256	243331	243332	243332	I	5148	“ Yes . The principal needs to be there — and liquid — when I need it . But if I ’m going to be out of a job , then I want to be able to live on the interest and dividends . I ’ve got a little bit of money coming in every month from my smartphone apps , and I ’ve got a couple more that are almost ready to go . ”
243335	243358	243332	243332	I	5148	“ I have n’t launched them because I have n’t had time , but I guess that ’s not an excuse anymore . ”
243368	243376	243359	243359	He	5148	“ You ’re going to be fine . ”
243377	243381	243382	243382	I	5148	“ I am , ”
243464	243497	243454	243454	I	5148	“ So you can help me set this up ? I want to know what percentage of the money I should put in stocks or bonds and all that kind of stuff . ”
243498	243509	243510	243510	he	5148	“ I ’ll teach you whatever you want to know , ”
243525	243535	243536	243536	I	5148	“ Brokers get paid with the trades , right ? ”
243591	243594	243595	243595	he	5148	“ Right , ”
243598	243627	243595	243595	he	5148	“ We could also interview financial managers . They take a percentage , but if they know their stuff , the money grows enough to cover the cost . ”
243628	243637	243638	243638	I	5148	“ That ’s where my mother screwed up , ”
243666	243672	243673	243673	he	5148	“ She made bad choices , ”
243676	243681	243673	243673	he	5148	“ You wo n’t . ”
243682	243700	243673	243673	he	5148	“ I ’m not so sure . I ’ve made plenty of bad choices in the past . ”
243724	243787	243673	243673	he	5148	“ Just the fact that you ’re being so careful and asking so many questions proves to me that you ’re going to be fine . And so is your money . I work with several brokers and managers . If you like , I can have Sylvia set up some meetings , get them into the office today if you want . ”
243788	243794	243795	243795	I	5148	“ That would be great , ”
243804	243812	243795	243795	I	5148	“ No . No , never mind . ”
243813	243817	243818	243818	he	5148	“ All right , ”
243832	243837	243818	243818	he	5148	“ Whatever you want . ”
243838	243844	243845	243845	I	5148	“ That ’s the thing , ”
243848	243856	243857	243857	I	5148	“ I already know who I want . ”
243863	243885	243857	243857	I	5148	“ Will you manage it for me ? I ca n’t imagine there ’s anyone I would trust more than you . ”
243923	243926	243927	243927	he	5148	“ No , ”
243936	244028	243927	243927	he	5148	“ That ’s not what I do . But I do oversee my own managers with such microscopic interest that I imagine they consider me among their most irritating clients . Fortunately , the percentage they earn off the growth is sufficient to quell that irritation . I wo n’t manage your money , but I will babysit it . I ’ll introduce you to my manager , we ’ll get you set up , explain your goals , and then I ’ll watch over your nest egg . Sound good ? ”
244029	244039	244101	244101	he	5148	“ Will you explain the investment choices to me ? ”
244040	244075	243927	243927	he	5148	“ I ’ll explain anything you want . We ’ll do this together , okay ? And who knows . Maybe next you ’ll be asking me to help with your start - up . ”
244076	244081	244082	244082	I	5148	“ Do n’t push , ”
244142	244176	244130	244130	He	5148	“ I ’m not pushing . Why would I push you to go out on your own when I ’d much rather get you set up as a division of Stark Applied Technology ? ”
244180	244216	244177	244177	I	5148	“ Once I ’m out there on my own and raking in the dollars , then you can buy me out for some obscene amount of money . But I ’m starting on my own . ”
244217	244221	244222	244222	he	5148	“ Fair enough , ”
244225	244273	244222	244222	he	5148	“ I just want to see you actually start . I ’m waiting , you know . I fully intend to license some of your software for use in my offices . The cross - platform note system you told me about could come in quite handy . ”
244274	244288	244289	244289	I	5148	“ All the more reason not to jump in before I ’m ready , ”
244293	244303	244289	244289	I	5148	“ I do n’t want to let you down . ”
244304	244312	244313	244313	he	5148	“ You could never let me down , ”
244327	244335	244316	244316	He	5148	“ And , Nikki ? Thank you . ”
244336	244340	244289	244289	I	5148	“ For what ? ”
244341	244352	244316	244316	He	5148	“ For trusting me to help you with the million . ”
244468	244477	244478	244478	I	5148	“ I ’ve trusted you with my heart , ”
244488	244499	244478	244478	I	5148	“ Why would n’t I trust you with my money ? ”
244514	244525	244506	244506	His	5148	“ You do know that I trust you , too ? ”
244526	244530	244531	244531	I	5148	“ Of course , ”
244534	244550	244506	244506	His	5148	“ Just because it takes me time , does n’t mean I trust you less . ”
244551	244556	244557	244557	I	5148	“ I know that , ”
244764	244778	244779	244779	I	5148	“ I thought decorating your house was something you did on your own , ”
244782	244813	244814	244814	His	3250	“ No . I said everything in the house is special to me . And if we pick something out together , it will be even that much more precious . ”
244847	244857	244858	244858	I	5148	“ I thought you were taking the day off , ”
244861	244869	244870	244870	he	3250	“ Do you have a better suggestion ? ”
244880	244890	244870	244870	he	3250	“ As a matter of fact , I do . ”
244951	244957	244958	244958	he	3250	“ William Powell is brilliant , ”
244961	244973	244958	244958	he	3250	“ but I think I have a crush on Myrna Loy . ”
244974	244983	244984	244984	I	5148	“ I have a crush on her wardrobe , ”
244987	245002	244984	244984	I	5148	“ I could have lived back then . Fitted dresses and flowing evening gowns . ”
245003	245012	244958	244958	he	3250	“ Maybe we need to take you shopping . ”
245013	245019	245020	245020	I	5148	“ I ’d love it , ”
245023	245045	245020	245020	I	5148	“ But you ’ve already filled up a closet for me in Malibu , and the house itself is sitting empty . ”
245060	245071	245046	245046	I	5148	“ If we go shopping , it ’s for furniture . ”
245072	245076	245077	245077	he	3250	“ All right , ”
245080	245086	245077	245077	he	3250	“ It ’s a date . ”
245227	245230	245231	245231	I	5148	“ Hello ? ”
245235	245248	245231	245231	I	5148	“ Nikki ? It ’s Lisa . We met in the cafeteria . ”
245249	245252	245253	245253	I	5148	“ Oh ! ”
245261	245278	245253	245253	I	5148	“ If you ’re looking to do coffee , I ’m not in the office today . ”
245294	245298	245299	245299	she	692	“ I know , ”
245302	245340	245299	245299	she	692	“ Listen , I heard what happened , and I just wanted to say that I ’m sorry . The press are a bunch of vultures , and it sucks that they ’re shitting all over you . ”
245341	245344	245345	245345	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
245348	245395	245299	245299	she	692	“ I dropped into the office to see you , and after I learned what happened , Bruce gave me your number . I just wanted to let you know that my offer for lunch or coffee is still open . Anytime . Just call me . ”
245396	245400	245401	245401	I	5148	“ I will , ”
245495	245500	245501	245501	I	5148	“ It ’s not , ”
245504	245512	245501	245501	I	5148	“ It ’s all about the money . ”
245663	245670	245671	245671	Damien	5148	“ Do you want more popcorn ? ”
245700	245703	245704	245704	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
245707	245710	245704	245704	I	5148	“ What ? ”
245711	245714	245715	245715	I	5148	“ Nothing . ”
245718	245726	245715	245715	I	5148	“ I just like saying your name . ”
245727	245733	245734	245734	He	5148	“ I like hearing it . ”
245748	245751	245752	245752	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
245756	245759	245715	245715	I	5148	“ Yes ? ”
245760	245779	245734	245734	He	5148	“ Would you mind very much if we skipped the movie ? I have something else in mind . ”
245780	245784	245715	245715	I	5148	“ Do you ? ”
245804	245808	245809	245809	I	5148	“ No talking , ”
245812	245829	245809	245809	I	5148	“ Not until we get back in the bed . Those are my rules . Okay ? ”
246720	246724	246725	246725	he	5148	“ Tai chi , ”
246735	246754	246725	246725	he	5148	“ It keeps me flexible . Come on in . Go ahead , Charles . You were saying ? ”
246828	246846	246847	246847	Charles	0	“ We managed to keep all images of the actual artwork out of the more prominent venues , ”
246850	246891	246847	246847	Charles	0	“ I ’m somewhat surprised that the various editorial staffs caved to yesterday ’s demand letter , but I ’ll attribute that to your reputation and deep pockets . No one wants to get in a battle with Damien Stark . ”
246892	246911	246847	246847	Charles	0	“ They probably know that if they push me on this , I ’ll just buy them out . ”
246912	246930	246847	246847	Charles	0	“ If you mean that , I ’ll certainly share that information if I get any pushback . ”
246931	246936	246937	246937	Damien	5148	“ I mean it , ”
246940	246961	246962	246962	He	5148	“ If that ’s what it takes to make this go away , then that ’s what I ’ll do . ”
246994	247002	247003	247003	Charles	0	“ Blaine faxed back his affidavit yesterday , ”
247006	247021	247003	247003	Charles	0	“ so we filed the Application for Temporary Restraining Order first thing this morning . ”
247022	247033	247034	247034	I	5148	“ You can actually keep them from talking about this ? ”
247048	247081	247037	247037	Charles	0	“ I ’m afraid we ca n’t do that . We could sue for defamation , but that requires a false statement , and Damien assures me that the rumors are true . ”
247090	247097	247087	247087	I	5148	“ Then what are you doing ? ”
247098	247139	247037	247037	Charles	0	“ We want to stop the publication of the painting itself . Or any other of Blaine ’s works . It ’s his style that ’s partly fueling the fire . The idea that the image is dark and erotic . ”
247140	247143	247087	247087	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
247150	247202	247087	247087	I	5148	“ But how can you keep them from printing photographs ? I saw the reporter taking pictures at the party . And there must be dozens of Blaine ’s paintings in Southern California . Anybody could invite a reporter in to take a few snaps if they want some extra cash . ”
247203	247215	247216	247216	Damien	5148	“ The owner of the painting does n’t own the copyright , ”
247219	247234	247216	247216	Damien	5148	“ That remains with Blaine . So that ’s how we ’re handling it . ”
247235	247247	247248	247248	Charles	0	“ Of course , they can still print photos of you , ”
247267	247271	247272	247272	I	5148	“ I understand , ”
247275	247296	247272	247272	I	5148	“ I suppose every little bit helps . But how on earth did you pull all this together so fast ? ”
247297	247313	247356	247356	I	5148	“ I ’m sure you realize that Damien is one of my most important clients — ”
247314	247318	247319	247319	Damien	5148	“ One of ? ”
247323	247329	247330	247330	Charles	0	“ My most important client , ”
247336	247355	247330	247330	Charles	0	“ When he sends me a text outlining an urgent matter , I set the wheels in motion . ”
247382	247386	247387	247387	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
247390	247395	247387	247387	I	5148	“ Thank you both . ”
247396	247403	247404	247404	Damien	5148	“ It ’s only a start . ”
247409	247416	247404	247404	Damien	5148	“ Did you bring the footage ? ”
247433	247458	247417	247417	Charles	0	“ Everything that ’s aired so far , and as much of the raw footage from outside Nikki ’s condo as we could obtain . ”
247459	247462	247463	247463	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
247466	247472	247473	247473	Damien	5148	“ Someone leaked this story , ”
247476	247484	247473	247473	Damien	5148	“ I intend to find out who . ”
247485	247504	247417	247417	Charles	0	“ But you just said that if it ’s the truth there ’s nothing you can do legally . ”
247505	247508	247509	247509	Damien	5148	“ No , ”
247518	247555	247509	247509	Damien	5148	“ There ’s not a damn thing I can do legally . But I want to know who did this to you . Do n’t ask me to stop , Nikki . Because I wo n’t . ”
247556	247564	247565	247565	I	5148	“ I ’m not going to ask , ”
247579	247591	247572	247572	I	5148	“ But how is looking at the footage going to help ? ”
247592	247606	247607	247607	he	5148	“ I ’m going to identify all of the reporters asking you questions , ”
247610	247626	247607	247607	he	5148	“ And then Charles or I will have a little talk with each of them . ”
247655	247659	247660	247660	Damien	5148	“ Anything else ? ”
247663	247668	247669	247669	Charles	0	“ Not about this . ”
247674	247696	247669	247669	Charles	0	“ But Germany is heating up , Damien . They have the janitor now . We need to expect the worst . ”
247697	247704	247705	247705	Damien	5148	“ I always expect the worst , ”
247708	247718	247705	247705	Damien	5148	“ It ’s how I ’ve survived so long . ”
247719	247727	247728	247728	Charles	0	“ There are other issues in Europe , ”
247731	247736	247728	247728	Charles	0	“ You really should — ”
247737	247741	247742	247742	Damien	5148	“ I know , ”
247752	247763	247742	247742	Damien	5148	“ But I ’m tied up here at the moment . ”
247764	247767	247768	247768	I	5148	“ Wait , ”
247771	247808	247768	247768	I	5148	“ I may not know the details of what ’s going on , but if the company ’s having legal trouble overseas and you need to be there , then go . I ’ll be fine . ”
247809	247814	247815	247815	Charles	0	“ She ’s right , ”
247818	247825	247815	247815	Charles	0	“ You ’re needed in London . ”
247838	247841	247842	247842	I	5148	“ Sofia ? ”
247860	247872	247873	247873	Damien	5148	“ There are financial problems I need to take care of , ”
247876	247886	247887	247887	Charles	0	“ You can handle everything in a few hours , ”
247890	247900	247887	247887	Charles	0	“ But you need to be on - site . ”
247901	247904	247905	247905	Damien	5148	“ Fine , ”
247924	247931	247908	247908	He	0	“ I ’ll leave Friday night . ”
247932	247940	247941	247941	Charles	0	“ That ’s the tennis center dedication , ”
247944	247951	247941	247941	Charles	0	“ Damien , you should go . ”
247952	247969	247908	247908	He	0	“ But I ’m not going . I ’ve already said why . That ’s final . ”
247997	248000	248001	248001	Charles	0	“ Fine , ”
248004	248031	248001	248001	Charles	0	“ You ’ll leave Friday , then . If you ’re out of the country , that ’s another excuse we can throw to the press . ”
248032	248046	248047	248047	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t give a damn what you say to the press , ”
248056	248088	248047	248047	Damien	5148	“ There and back again , Charles . And if you ca n’t get me in and out quickly on commercial flights , then tell Grayson we ’re taking the Lear . ”
248089	248095	248096	248096	He	0	“ I ’ll arrange it . ”
248101	248106	248096	248096	He	0	“ You ’re sure ? ”
248107	248118	248119	248119	I	5148	“ There are a lot of things on your resume , ”
248122	248141	248119	248119	I	5148	“ But I ’m pretty sure babysitter is n’t one of them . Yes . I ’m sure . ”
248142	248157	248096	248096	He	0	“ Fine , but I want you to stay here while I ’m gone . ”
248166	248174	248158	248158	I	5148	“ I ’ll be fine at home . ”
248175	248181	248182	248182	he	0	“ They ’ll hound you , ”
248185	248192	248193	248193	he	0	“ And they ’ll hound Jamie , ”
248207	248233	248193	248193	he	0	“ Mostly , it will make me feel better . Please , Nikki . Right now I ’m asking . Do n’t make me demand . ”
248308	248315	248361	248361	he	5148	“ Fine . I ’ll stay . ”
248316	248360	248361	248361	he	5148	“ Thank you . Besides , I want to install better security at your place . Charles , on your way out , tell Sylvia to make arrangements for that and to let Ms. Archer know when the installation will happen . What ? ”
248368	248371	248402	248402	he	5148	“ Nothing . ”
248407	248410	248411	248411	he	5148	“ Correction , ”
248416	248448	248411	248411	he	5148	“ Tell Sylvia to ask Ms. Archer if she ’s amenable to a security system and , if so , when would be a convenient time for the install . Better ? ”
248452	248456	248449	248449	I	5148	“ And thanks . ”
248486	248496	248472	248472	I	5148	“ London , huh ? I miss you already . ”
248497	248521	248449	248449	I	5148	“ Just so we ’re clear , I do n’t want you to stay in my apartment because I ’m worried about you . ”
248522	248525	248472	248472	I	5148	“ No ? ”
248526	248542	248449	248449	I	5148	“ I want you here because I like the idea of you in my bed . ”
248543	248572	248472	248472	I	5148	“ That works out well , then . Because I like being in your bed , too . Mostly , though , I like being in your arms . ”
249257	249261	249262	249262	she	356	“ Ms. Fairchild , ”
249265	249270	249262	249262	she	356	“ How are you ? ”
249271	249274	249275	249275	I	5148	“ Good , ”
249278	249286	249275	249275	I	5148	“ How ’s life on the outside ? ”
249292	249299	249287	249287	Damien	5148	“ Going a little stir crazy ? ”
249300	249313	249262	249262	she	356	“ Not that I do n’t love this fairy palace , but — ”
249333	249341	249314	249314	He	5148	“ What have you got for me ? ”
249342	249348	249349	249349	she	356	“ Just a few signatures , ”
249365	249372	249373	249373	she	356	“ And this came for you , ”
249409	249414	249415	249415	I	5148	“ That ’s weird , ”
249432	249436	249437	249437	he	5148	“ Open it , ”
249471	249474	249475	249475	Damien	5148	“ Motherfucker , ”
249511	249524	249488	249488	He	5148	“ Get this to Charles . Do n’t get fingerprints on it . ”
249525	249545	249488	249488	He	5148	“ Of course , Mr. Stark . Ms. Fairchild , I ’m so sorry . I did n’t know . ”
249546	249555	249556	249556	I	5148	“ No , of course you did n’t , ”
249559	249566	249567	249567	Damien	5148	“ It ’s okay , Sylvia . ”
249577	249588	249574	249574	She	356	“ I ’ll just come back for those documents later . ”
249602	249641	249589	249589	She	356	“ I apologize if this is out of line , Ms. Fairchild , but I just wanted to say that I saw the painting when I was at the Malibu house coordinating with the decorator before the party . ”
249669	249676	249677	249677	she	356	“ It ’s a beautiful portrait , ”
249680	249710	249677	249677	she	356	“ Stunning and engaging . Frankly , I think Mr. Stark got a bargain . As far as I ’m concerned , it ’s worth at least two million . ”
249735	249739	249740	249740	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
249754	249759	249746	249746	I	5148	“ I like her . ”
249760	249763	249764	249764	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
249768	249774	249764	249764	he	5148	“ She ’s very capable . ”
249802	249808	249798	249798	he	5148	“ That will be all . ”
249819	249833	249834	249834	Damien	5148	“ There are a lot of fucked - up people in the world , ”
249839	249848	249834	249834	Damien	5148	“ Do n’t let them get to you . ”
249849	249864	249809	249809	She	356	“ You ’re never going to be able to track who sent that letter . ”
249865	249889	249834	249834	Damien	5148	“ Maybe not , but I ’m going to try . By the way , I figured out which reporter originated the story . ”
249890	249897	249809	249809	She	356	“ Did Charles go see him ? ”
249898	249954	249834	249834	Damien	5148	“ He refused to reveal his source . I may pay him a visit myself , but I thought I ’d go the more civilized route first . I ’ve hired a private investigator . I ’m guessing he met in person with the source . With any luck , my guy will learn something . ”
250035	250042	250043	250043	I	5148	“ I want to go out , ”
250066	250072	250043	250043	I	5148	“ Any place in particular ? ”
250073	250081	250082	250082	I	5148	“ I was thinking about the MoCa , ”
250085	250098	250082	250082	I	5148	“ I figure there are n’t many reporters lying in wait there . ”
250099	250103	250104	250104	he	5148	“ All right , ”
250107	250112	250104	250104	he	5148	“ Let ’s go . ”
250113	250121	250122	250122	I	5148	“ But then I changed my mind , ”
250125	250165	250122	250122	I	5148	“ I want to go shopping . Let ’s go look for things for the house . There are all sorts of cute stores on Melrose . Or anywhere in West Hollywood . Does n’t that sound like fun ? ”
250166	250177	250178	250178	he	5148	“ I always have fun when I ’m with you , ”
250181	250215	250178	250178	he	5148	“ But that area is crowded , and it only takes one person who gets off on tabloid news calling TMZ or some other rag before we ’ll be surrounded by the vultures . ”
250216	250220	250221	250221	I	5148	“ I know , ”
250224	250263	250221	250221	I	5148	“ But I do n’t care . I want back in the world . It ’s not like they ca n’t get me in here , too . Did n’t one of them just send me a letter ? ”
250270	250276	250277	250277	he	5148	“ All right , then , ”
250280	250288	250277	250277	he	5148	“ I guess we have a date . ”
250358	250365	250366	250366	Damien	5148	“ A bed , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
250369	250375	250376	250376	I	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
250379	250396	250376	250376	I	5148	“ It ’s worth considering . After all , the house is currently without a bed . ”
250420	250427	250428	250428	His	5148	“ Shall we test it out ? ”
250432	250453	250428	250428	His	5148	“ Careful . You ’re subject to my rules , remember ? Who knows what I might make you do ? ”
250454	250458	250459	250459	I	5148	“ Good point , ”
250511	250516	250517	250517	he	5148	“ Well , hello , ”
250524	250533	250517	250517	he	5148	“ I swear I did n’t orchestrate that . ”
250597	250602	250588	250588	I	5148	“ Let ’s go , ”
250610	250625	250603	250603	I	5148	“ This bed is n’t nearly as cool as our old one , anyway . ”
250746	250764	250726	250726	he	5148	“ Nikki ! Is it true that you were fired from Innovative for violating a morals clause ? ”
250765	250789	250726	250726	he	5148	“ The tennis center dedication begins in four hours , Mr. Stark . Can you elaborate on your previous statement regarding Merle Richter ? ”
250790	250817	250726	250726	he	5148	“ Damien ! Have you been informed about the content of Mr. Schmidt ’s affidavit ? Is it true that he was paid to keep quiet ? ”
250855	250869	250898	250907	A thin - lipped reporter in a neatly pressed suit	3309	“ What are you going to do with your million dollars , Nikki ? ”
250918	250945	250898	250907	A thin - lipped reporter in a neatly pressed suit	3309	“ Can you comment on the rumors that you ’ve slept with men in the past for money ? Is Mr. Stark your most lucrative client ? ”
251045	251050	251051	251051	He	5148	“ Damien ! No ! ”
251086	251089	251090	251090	I	5148	“ No , ”
251103	251142	251090	251090	I	5148	“ Do you want to get arrested ? They ’ll take you away from me , and even if it ’s only a few hours until you post bail , I ’ll be alone until you get out . ”
251195	251210	251190	251190	she	651	“ Um , mister ? Tell him there ’s an alley in the back . ”
251224	251235	251211	251211	She	651	“ Unless you want to go through those creeps again . ”
251359	251368	251369	251369	Damien	5148	“ I should have smashed his face in , ”
251372	251380	251381	251381	I	5148	“ No , you should n’t have , ”
251397	251407	251384	251384	I	5148	“ Besides , in a way he ’s right . ”
251422	251437	251408	251408	Damien	5148	“ That million was n’t just a modeling fee and we both know it . ”
251452	251460	251438	251438	He	5148	“ I ’ve done this to you . ”
251470	251505	251438	251438	He	5148	“ I swore that I would never hurt you . That I would be the one you could hold tight to . And yet I ’m the one who has done this to you . ”
251506	251509	251510	251510	My	5148	“ No . ”
251517	251553	251554	251554	I	5148	“ You ’ve never done anything to hurt me . Ever . And I took the money because I wanted it . And I took your deal because I wanted you . To be honest , ”
251561	251573	251554	251554	I	5148	“ I would have said yes for a lot less money . ”
251574	251577	251578	251578	He	5148	“ Really ? ”
251583	251596	251597	251597	he	5148	“ Now I really do feel like a fool . Come here , ”
251656	251660	251661	251661	he	5148	“ Come on , ”
251664	251677	251661	251661	he	5148	“ You know what I want . And what we both need . ”
251742	251772	251723	251723	He	5148	“ It occurs to me that this is the most surefire way to keep you in my apartment — and in my bed — while I ’m in London . ”
251773	251779	251780	251780	I	5148	“ You would n’t dare , ”
251793	251798	251780	251780	I	5148	“ Would n’t I ? ”
251853	251862	251863	251863	I	5148	“ Do n’t you even think about it , ”
251887	251890	251891	251891	he	5148	“ No ? ”
251905	251927	251895	251895	he	5148	“ You do n’t want to stay like this , in my bed , constantly ready to be fucked by me ? ”
251928	251937	251938	251938	I	5148	“ Now that you put it that way , ”
252376	252381	252382	252382	I	5148	“ Thinking about you , ”
252386	252390	252382	252382	I	5148	“ Missing you . ”
252630	252633	252634	252634	I	5148	“ Hello ? ”
252638	252649	252650	252650	I	5148	“ Yes , Ms. Fairchild ? Can I help you ? ”
252659	252669	252670	252670	I	5148	“ Um , yeah . Is this Ms. Peters ? ”
252685	252703	252670	252670	I	5148	“ How kind of you to remember . It is . What can I do for you ? ”
252704	252729	252670	252670	I	5148	“ I do n’t have a car and I need to go pick up something at home . Could you arrange a taxi or — ”
252730	252757	252670	252670	I	5148	“ I ’ll have Edward bring the limo around . If you take the elevator to parking level C , he ’ll meet you right there . ”
252758	252765	252766	252766	I	5148	“ Oh . Okay . Thanks . ”
252799	252804	252805	252805	I	5148	“ Thanks so much , ”
252808	252821	252805	252805	I	5148	“ Not at all , Ms. Fairchild . Where are we going ? ”
252822	252826	252827	252827	I	5148	“ My condo , ”
252830	252852	252827	252827	I	5148	“ I just need to run in and pick up something . And I really wish you ’d call me Nikki . ”
252853	252860	252861	252861	he	5148	“ Right away , Ms. Fairchild , ”
252990	252996	252971	252971	I	5148	“ Will you be long ? ”
252997	253026	252971	252971	I	5148	“ Not too long . I need to download a couple of things onto my laptop , but that ’s all . Are you listening to a book ? ”
253027	253034	253035	253035	he	5148	“ Decided to try a classic , ”
253038	253056	253035	253035	he	5148	“ The Count of Monte Cristo . Not bad , so far . Not bad at all . ”
253161	253165	253166	253166	I	5148	“ Jesus Christ ! ”
253169	253184	253185	253185	He	837	“ You almost gave me a heart attack . What are you doing here ? ”
253215	253220	253208	253208	I	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
253228	253233	253234	253234	I	5148	“ Oh , shit , ”
253237	253254	253234	253234	I	5148	“ You and Jamie didn’t — I mean , she ’s out with Raine right now . ”
253418	253427	253428	253428	he	837	“ I did n’t do anything with Jamie , ”
253432	253440	253428	253428	he	837	“ Courtney and I had a fight . ”
253441	253448	253449	253449	I	5148	“ Oh . I ’m sorry , ”
253458	253465	253466	253466	He	837	“ Yeah , me , too . ”
253474	253491	253466	253466	He	837	“ We ’re meeting for dinner . Patch things up . At least I hope so . ”
253492	253496	253497	253497	I	5148	“ So do I. ”
253551	253564	253565	253565	He	837	“ Jamie let me crash here . I slept in your room . ”
253599	253614	253594	253594	he	837	“ I did n’t figure you ’d mind if I slept in your bed . ”
253615	253620	253621	253621	I	5148	“ I do mind , ”
253662	253693	253648	253648	I	5148	“ You just grab my bed like everything is like it always was ? It ’s not . I ’ve needed a friend , and you have n’t even called . ”
253694	253710	253711	253711	he	837	“ Maybe I did n’t call because you did n’t tell me about the painting , ”
253714	253723	253711	253711	he	837	“ A million dollars . Is it true ? ”
253724	253729	253730	253730	I	5148	“ It ’s true , ”
253738	253746	253733	253733	He	837	“ Stark ’s bad news , Nikki . ”
253747	253750	253751	253751	I	5148	“ No , ”
253755	253781	253751	253751	I	5148	“ He ’s not . And did you ever think that that ’s exactly why I did n’t say anything about the painting to you ? ”
253782	253818	253819	253819	He	837	“ Why the hell are you so fucking obstinate ? Are you afraid to learn the truth about him ? Or are you afraid I ’ll learn the truth about what you do with him ? ”
253887	253894	253895	253895	he	837	“ You ’re being an idiot , ”
253916	253936	253898	253898	He	837	“ How long will it be before Stark does something else that makes you take a knife to yourself ? ”
253957	253966	253967	253967	I	5148	“ Get the hell out of my house , ”
253985	253990	253991	253991	he	837	“ Oh , shit , ”
253994	254009	253991	253991	he	837	“ Oh , shit , oh , shit . Nikki , I ’m sorry . ”
254010	254017	254018	254018	I	5148	“ No , you ’re not , ”
254021	254044	254018	254018	I	5148	“ You ’d be thrilled if Damien and I broke up . I do n’t know why you dislike him so much — ”
254045	254057	253991	253991	he	837	“ And I do n’t know why you ’re so blind . ”
254058	254063	254064	254064	I	5148	“ I ’m not , ”
254067	254074	254064	254064	I	5148	“ I see him perfectly clearly . ”
254075	254109	254110	254110	Ollie	837	“ You see what he wants you to see . But you forget where I work . You forget that my boss is his attorney . There is shit raining down on Stark , ”
254113	254125	254126	254126	He	837	“ and I do n’t want to see you get hurt . ”
254129	254163	254126	254126	He	837	“ I warned you , did n’t I ? You ’re in the spotlight now , and that ’s not where you want to be . It ’s not where you should be . ”
254188	254192	254179	254179	I	5148	“ Just go . ”
254193	254209	254210	254210	He	837	“ Fine , whatever . I ’ll get my stuff and get out of here . ”
254231	254271	254222	254222	He	837	“ No , you know what ? I get that things are bad between us now , and I ’m sorry . But I ca n’t just let this slide . Do you even know where he is now ? ”
254280	254284	254272	254272	I	5148	“ In London . ”
254285	254288	254272	254272	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
254289	254292	254272	254272	I	5148	“ Business . ”
254293	254296	254297	254297	He	837	“ Yeah ? ”
254314	254317	254318	254318	he	837	“ Here , ”
254460	254466	254449	254449	I	5148	“ She ’s a friend . ”
254467	254475	254449	254449	I	5148	“ I thought he went on business . ”
254476	254491	254449	254449	I	5148	“ He ’s not allowed to see a friend while he ’s doing business ? ”
254556	254566	254567	254567	Ollie	837	“ I do n’t want to screw us up , ”
254571	254576	254577	254577	I	5148	“ You already have , ”
254580	254592	254577	254577	I	5148	“ All you can do now is try to fix it . ”
254612	254619	254609	254609	he	837	“ Yeah . I guess so . ”
254626	254655	254620	254620	He	837	“ Should probably fix things with my fiancée first . That ’s all I do , lately . Piss people off and then try to patch it up . ”
254656	254659	254664	254664	he	837	“ Ollie … ”
254902	254908	254909	254909	Edward	366	“ Back to the apartment ? ”
254929	254932	254933	254933	I	5148	“ Actually , ”
254936	254947	254933	254933	I	5148	“ there ’s one more place I want to go . ”
254948	254956	254933	254933	I	5148	“ How you holding up , Texas ? ”
254957	254963	254964	254964	We	3355	“ Okay , I guess . ”
255034	255082	255023	255023	I	5148	“ When I ’m inside and away from it all , I do great . But when I see a paper or am accosted by a reporter , I feel like I ’m going to crumble . Honestly , I do n’t know how celebrities do it . ”
255083	255090	255091	255091	she	761	“ They have the fame gene , ”
255094	255099	255091	255091	she	761	“ You do n’t . ”
255100	255110	255111	255111	I	5148	“ There ’s no such thing as bad PR ? ”
255115	255131	255091	255091	she	761	“ For some people , it ’s a truism . Have you watched reality television ? ”
255178	255199	255155	255155	she	761	“ Pretty soon you ’ll be last week ’s news . Until then , hold your head up and smile . ”
255207	255218	255200	255200	I	5148	“ That ’s one thing I know how to do . ”
255266	255284	255285	255285	Evelyn	5962	“ You ’re going to show me the shots you took at the party , I hope , ”
255288	255310	255285	255285	Evelyn	5962	“ The more snapshots there are of me , the better my odds of finding a picture that ’s actually flattering . ”
255311	255322	255323	255323	I	5148	“ Do not even try fishing for compliments with me , ”
255328	255339	255323	255323	I	5148	“ You ’re gorgeous and amazing and you know it . ”
255340	255345	255346	255346	she	5962	“ It ’s true , ”
255358	255367	255346	255346	she	5962	“ I just hope Blaine keeps remembering it . ”
255368	255377	255383	255383	they	3366	“ I think you ’ve got him hooked . ”
255499	255508	255509	255509	she	3372	“ Blaine ’s still mortified , of course , ”
255512	255519	255509	255509	she	3372	“ Thinks it ’s his fault . ”
255520	255525	255526	255526	I	5148	“ That ’s ridiculous , ”
255529	255561	255526	255526	I	5148	“ I ’m the one who accepted money to pose nude , and then I consented to be tied up . If it ’s anyone ’s fault , it ’s mine . ”
255562	255575	255576	255576	Evelyn	5962	“ We did n’t have any idea how much Damien paid you , ”
255579	255601	255576	255576	Evelyn	5962	“ but now that we do , I have to confess that I agree with Blaine . You sold yourself cheap . ”
255668	255704	255713	255713	She	3375	“ Aw , hell , Texas . I see it on your face . Now I ’ve gone and got you thinking about it . We ca n’t have that . You want some wine ? ”
255705	255709	255710	255710	I	5148	“ Love some , ”
255752	255761	255762	255762	she	3375	“ So tell me the rest of it , ”
255765	255776	255713	255713	She	3375	“ The rest of it ? The rest of what ? ”
255777	255845	255732	255732	She	3375	“ What ’s going on in your life , Texas . Fired twice — excuse me , once was a layoff . Dating one heck of a fine catch if I do say so myself . Your roommate ’s got a commercial in the works . Lot of life crammed into not very much time . You ’ve certainly made quite the landing in our fair city . ”
255855	255892	255850	255850	I	5148	“ Despite the firings and the tabloid stuff that we ’re just going to ignore , things are great . I ’m going to take some time to get a couple more apps on the market . ”
255898	255910	255893	255893	She	3375	“ An art app for Blaine . I have n’t forgotten . ”
255923	255949	255911	255911	I	5148	“ I ’m ready when you are . But that ’s my short - term plan . Long term is still in the development stages . ”
255950	255964	255911	255911	I	5148	“ And Damien ? You said he ’s in London ? On business ? ”
255965	255992	255911	255911	I	5148	“ Yeah , but I think he took some time to visit a friend . Sofia . I guess she ’s in some sort of trouble . ”
255993	255999	256000	256000	Evelyn	5962	“ That ’s too bad , ”
256016	256024	256003	256003	She	5962	“ He say what kind of trouble ? ”
256025	256028	255911	255911	I	5148	“ No . ”
256029	256032	256033	256033	she	5962	“ Hmm , ”
256036	256047	256033	256033	she	5962	“ What about Jamie ? What ’s she up to ? ”
256151	256157	256158	256158	I	5148	“ Jamie ’s in heaven , ”
256167	256191	256158	256158	I	5148	“ She ’s really hit it off with the guy she ’s doing this commercial with . Bryan Raine . You know him ? ”
256192	256196	256197	256197	Evelyn	5962	“ I do , ”
256207	256259	256201	256201	she	5962	“ I like your friend . Nice girl . A little green , but she ’ll get there . Bryan Raine , though … That one ’s a climber , and I ’m not sure your friend is tough enough to deal with the shit he ’ll eventually throw her way . ”
256265	256270	256260	256260	My	5148	“ You ’re serious ? ”
256271	256326	256327	256327	She	3379	“ Afraid so . He wo n’t be happy until he ’s banging the next big thing . And while he ’d prefer a female , I think he ’ll fuck anything that moves if he thinks it ’ll ease his climb to the top . Male , female , or small farm animal . ”
256333	256347	256327	256327	She	3379	“ Your friend got the skin to make it when he ditches her ? ”
256391	256398	256399	256399	I	5148	“ I hope you ’re wrong , ”
256402	256412	256385	256385	she	3379	“ So do I , Texas . So do I. ”
257035	257037	257022	257022	I	5148	“ howevers ”
257236	257241	257242	257242	Jamie	1450	“ This is great , ”
257247	257253	257242	257242	Jamie	1450	“ Thanks for bringing me . ”
257254	257261	257262	257262	he	0	“ Happy to have you along , ”
257277	257284	257285	257285	I	5148	“ So the trip went well ? ”
257296	257300	257301	257301	he	0	“ It did , ”
257304	257309	257285	257285	I	5148	“ Sofia ’s okay ? ”
257310	257315	257316	257316	he	0	“ She ’s settled , ”
257319	257363	257316	257316	he	0	“ For her , that ’s about as good as it gets . And I heard from Charles . He ’s been working with my attorneys in Germany , and with any luck , that problem is going to go away as well . ”
257364	257372	257285	257285	I	5148	“ You mean they wo n’t indict ? ”
257382	257388	257373	257373	He	0	“ That ’s my hope . ”
257389	257395	257396	257396	I	5148	“ That would be great , ”
257399	257451	257396	257396	I	5148	“ And even though I do n’t have a clue about international business or what kind of regulations the Germans think you mucked up , you know you can talk to me about that kind of thing . I may not get it , but I promise I ’ll be supportive . ”

257483	257494	257472	257472	He	0	“ And yes , I believe that you would understand . ”
257864	257877	257886	257886	He	0	“ Nikki , Damien , it ’s good to see you here . ”
257878	257881	257882	257882	Damien	0	“ Ollie , ”
257893	257896	257897	257897	I	5148	“ Courtney , ”
257900	257910	257897	257897	I	5148	“ it ’s so good to see you again . ”
257925	257931	257932	257932	Courtney	271	“ Great to meet you , ”
257942	257959	257960	257960	She	3412	“ I ’m planning a destination wedding shower , but I have n’t decided where yet . ”
257973	257988	257960	257960	She	3412	“ Tell me you two will come ? And Jamie and Raine , too . ”
258007	258018	258019	258019	I	5148	“ I ’m looking forward to hearing all the details , ”
258101	258109	258091	258091	I	5148	“ Susan is directing the fashion show . ”
258110	258118	258119	258119	Susan	646	“ I got my training in pageants , ”
258122	258135	258119	258119	Susan	646	“ although it was n’t formal training . More like an apprenticeship . ”
258136	258140	258141	258141	I	5148	“ Susan Morris ? ”
258148	258154	258141	258141	I	5148	“ Alicia Morris ’s mother ? ”
258168	258177	258178	258178	she	646	“ I was hoping you ’d remember me , ”
258181	258201	258178	258178	she	646	“ Ollie said that Damien Stark was here with his girlfriend , and I just had to see you . ”
258202	258210	258211	258212	Social Nikki	5143	“ I ’m so glad you did , ”
258248	258276	258277	258277	she	6039	“ Your mother and I have stayed close . In fact , since I moved to Park Cities , we lunch together at least once a week , ”
258291	258306	258307	258307	Her	6039	“ I talked to her just this morning , as a matter of fact . ”
258334	258338	258339	258339	I	5148	“ How nice , ”
258349	258367	258342	258342	I	5148	“ I should really go check on my friend Jamie . It was lovely talking to you . ”
258378	258420	258368	258368	She	6039	“ Your mother is so mortified she ca n’t even hold her head up in public . And you have n’t been any help . You have n’t returned her calls or her emails . It ’s terribly ungrateful , Nichole . ”
258433	258450	258427	258427	Damien	5148	“ I believe Nikki has already said that she needs to go check on her friend . ”
258467	258485	258460	258460	She	646	“ And you ! Elizabeth told me how you shipped her home just when Nichole needed her . ”
258508	258523	258524	258525	Susan Morris	646	“ And now you ’ve dragged her into this … this … degrading lifestyle ! ”
258539	258558	258559	258559	She	646	“ Posing nude . Erotic art . And accepting money like a common whore . It ’s contemptible . ”
258658	258666	258667	258667	Damien	5148	“ Get the hell out of here , ”
258678	258683	258684	258684	she	646	“ I will not , ”
258687	258712	258684	258684	she	646	“ You think you can buy anything ? Even a girl like Nichole in your bed ? I know your type , Damien Stark . ”
258713	258717	258718	258718	He	5148	“ Do you ? ”
258734	258774	258726	258726	she	646	“ In that case I think you would listen when I tell you to get out . And for the record , Nikki is a woman , not a girl . And the choice she made was her own . ”
258793	258802	258787	258787	she	646	“ Your mother expected better things from you . ”
258884	258912	258875	258875	he	837	“ Do what Mr. Stark says and get the hell out of here or I will have you fired from this pageant right here , right now . ”
258913	258916	258917	258917	She	271	“ I — ”
259042	259047	259048	259048	Courtney	271	“ Are you okay ? ”
259051	259054	259055	259055	I	5148	“ No , ”
259058	259063	259055	259055	I	5148	“ I ’m not . ”
259098	259105	259106	259106	Damien	5148	“ I ’ll take you home , ”
259120	259128	259109	259109	I	5148	“ No . I want to stay . ”
259129	259134	259106	259106	Damien	5148	“ You ’re sure ? ”
259144	259171	259135	259135	I	5148	“ I just need to go to the bathroom . Then I want to find Jamie . We have n’t looked at all the booths yet . ”
259214	259218	259194	259194	he	5148	“ Not important ? ”
259219	259222	259223	259223	he	5148	“ Charles , ”
259226	259258	259223	259223	he	5148	“ He ’s at one of the cash bars and wants to have a quick talk . I told him I was with you , and business could wait until morning . ”
259259	259263	259194	259194	he	5148	“ Can it ? ”
259271	259284	259264	259264	He	5148	“ Right now , the only thing I care about is you . ”
259290	259302	259285	259285	He	5148	“ It looks like the ladies ’ room is over there . ”
259619	259625	259599	259599	she	1450	“ I ’m finding Damien . ”
259626	259629	259630	259630	I	5148	“ Jamie ! ”
259664	259669	259670	259670	I	5148	“ I did n’t , ”
259674	259689	259670	259670	I	5148	“ I just dropped a soap dish . That ’s all . Jamie overreacted . ”
259711	259715	259716	259716	he	5148	“ All right , ”
259720	259729	259716	259716	he	5148	“ Now tell me the rest of it . ”
259755	259761	259762	259762	I	5148	“ I was going to , ”
259765	259788	259762	259762	I	5148	“ But I talked myself out of it . And then , really , I dropped the dispenser . It ’s slippery . ”
259789	259797	259730	259730	I	5148	“ You talked yourself out of it . ”
259807	259825	259826	259826	I	5148	“ I saw my reflection in the mirror . I was going to break it with that , ”
259838	259856	259762	259762	I	5148	“ You were going to break a mirror in a public restaurant instead of talking with me ? ”
259871	259875	259866	259866	I	5148	“ I see . ”
259876	259897	259857	259857	I	5148	“ I did n’t want to make it worse for you . But I guess I did that , anyway . ”
259898	259905	259906	259906	He	3432	“ But you ’re okay now ? ”
259912	259935	259857	259857	I	5148	“ Yes . Just a momentary glitch . System completely reset now . It was just that woman . That horrible woman . ”
259936	259940	259941	259941	he	3432	“ All right , ”
259956	259971	259945	259945	He	3432	“ Let ’s go . We ’ll let the janitors worry about the mess . ”
260009	260016	260017	260017	I	5148	“ I ’m worried about Jamie , ”
260021	260027	260017	260017	I	5148	“ She was a mess . ”
260028	260034	260062	260062	Damien	5148	“ Do you know why ? ”
260035	260054	260055	260055	I	5148	“ No , she was just — oh , shit . Is that who I think it is ? ”
260067	260071	260062	260062	Damien	5148	“ Well , hell ”
260105	260111	260112	260112	Damien	5148	“ That ’s Madeline Aimes , ”
260121	260131	260117	260117	Evelyn	5962	“ A movie star ? On her way up ? ”
260139	260149	260132	260132	He	5148	“ When did you start paying attention to Hollywood ? ”
260150	260158	260159	260159	I	5148	“ I do n’t . Lucky guess . ”
260169	260178	260159	260159	I	5148	“ Now I really want to find Jamie . ”
260250	260259	260260	260260	Edward	366	“ I ’m so sorry , Mr. Stark , ”
260274	260286	260260	260260	Edward	366	“ She assured me that she ’d cleared it with you . ”
260287	260294	260295	260295	Damien	5148	“ Do n’t worry about it , ”
260298	260303	260295	260295	Damien	5148	“ How was she ? ”
260304	260332	260260	260260	Edward	366	“ I understand there was some trouble with a young man she ’s been seeing . You might have to restock the limo ’s supply of Scotch . ”
260336	260344	260345	260345	he	5148	“ Shall we go check on her ? ”
260388	260396	260381	260381	Ollie	837	“ Raine was just stringing her along . ”
260403	260410	260397	260397	I	5148	“ Well , yeah . Obviously . ”
260411	260414	260415	260415	He	837	“ Obviously ? ”
260422	260432	260415	260415	He	837	“ He ’s doing the same thing to you . ”
260455	260464	260442	260442	I	5148	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
260465	260477	260478	260478	He	837	“ He keeps you around , but it ’s not real . ”
260488	260506	260478	260478	He	837	“ It ’s just kink and fun and when he ’s tired he ’ll toss you aside . ”
260507	260512	260513	260513	Damien	5148	“ You little shit , ”
260516	260563	260513	260513	Damien	5148	“ I ’m wrong ? Really ? You know damn well it ’s just a game to you . That ’s why you never tell her shit . That ’s why you have n’t even told her that you ’ve been indicted in Germany for murder . ”
260582	260588	260589	260589	Damien	5148	“ There ’s no indictment , ”
260604	260628	260596	260596	Ollie	837	“ No , apparently they were just stalling . The indictment came in just a few minutes ago . You did n’t know ? ”
260629	260632	260633	260633	I	5148	“ Wait , ”
260727	260752	260717	260717	I	5148	“ All this time I ’ve been assuming that the German indictment is some business violation , and it was actually a murder investigation ? ”
260791	260794	260795	260795	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
260862	260886	260917	260917	He	5148	“ I thought your company had broken some regulation about zoning codes or paid too little in taxes or something . This is — ”
260887	260890	260891	260891	Damien	5148	“ Worse , ”
260894	260898	260891	260891	Damien	5148	“ Much worse . ”
260951	260956	260957	260957	I	5148	“ I ’m going , ”
260960	260968	260957	260957	I	5148	“ I need to check on Jamie . ”
260969	260973	260974	260974	Damien	5148	“ All right , ”
260984	260994	260974	260974	Damien	5148	“ Edward and I will drop you at home . ”
260995	261006	260957	260957	I	5148	“ I ’ll get home on my own . Thanks . ”
261007	261013	261014	261014	Ollie	837	“ I ’ll drive you , ”
261017	261023	261024	261024	I	5148	“ The hell you will , ”
261058	261065	261049	261049	Ollie	837	“ I ’ll take a taxi . ”
261679	261688	261661	261661	he	3461	“ How did you get here so fast ? ”
261689	261715	261661	261661	he	3461	“ Edward is parked at the end of the block . I was planning to come over anyway , but I was giving you time . ”
261716	261724	261661	261661	he	3461	“ Oh . Did you ask him ? ”
261725	261734	261735	261735	Damien	5148	“ She did n’t say anything to him , ”
261738	261764	261735	261735	Damien	5148	“ And he walked her to the door and heard her lock it after he left . He assumed she ’d be asleep in minutes . ”
261809	261826	261765	261765	I	5148	“ She ’s drunk and she ’s pissed and she ’s going to do something stupid . ”
261827	261835	261765	261765	I	5148	“ Did you check for her car ? ”
261836	261839	261840	261840	I	5148	“ Dammit , ”
261843	261852	261840	261840	I	5148	“ I did n’t even think about it . ”
261853	261903	261765	261765	I	5148	“ She could have taken a taxi or had a friend pick her up , but if it ’s still here , it ’s a start . I can get one of my security guys calling the taxi services to see if there was a call , and then — ”
261959	261962	261963	261963	I	5148	“ James ! ”
261982	261991	261963	261963	I	5148	“ Are you okay ? Where were you ? ”
262011	262016	262017	262017	I	5148	“ Oh , James , ”
262057	262066	262067	262067	I	5148	“ I ’m going to go help her , ”
262080	262087	262071	262071	I	5148	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
262115	262124	262125	262125	she	3465	“ I fucked up , did n’t I ? ”
262128	262137	262138	262138	I	5148	“ Bryan Raine is the fuck - up , ”
262141	262148	262138	262138	I	5148	“ You just need to sleep . ”
262149	262152	262153	262153	she	3465	“ Sleep , ”
262168	262173	262174	262174	I	5148	“ Night , James , ”
262188	262193	262194	262194	she	3465	“ You ’re lucky , ”
262197	262202	262183	262183	she	3465	“ He loves you . ”
262285	262290	262291	262291	he	5148	“ That was Edward , ”
262294	262307	262291	262291	he	5148	“ I ’m sending him home . I ’m staying here tonight . ”
262308	262314	262276	262276	He	5148	“ I do n’t think — ”
262315	262320	262321	262321	he	5148	“ I ’m staying , ”
262324	262355	262321	262321	he	5148	“ In your bed , on the couch , in the goddamn bathtub . I do n’t care , but you ’re not getting rid of me . Not tonight . ”
262356	262361	262362	262362	I	5148	“ Fine . Whatever . ”
262371	262379	262362	262362	I	5148	“ But I ’m going to bed . ”
262410	262417	262418	262418	I	5148	“ The bed in my room , ”
262421	262441	262418	262418	I	5148	“ There ’s a spare blanket in the hall cabinet . Help yourself to whatever ’s in the fridge . ”
262522	262526	262527	262527	I	5148	“ Come in , ”
262546	262553	262539	262539	I	5148	“ Where did you find that ? ”
262554	262558	262559	262559	he	5148	“ Your cupboard , ”
262562	262565	262559	262559	he	5148	“ Okay ? ”
262610	262615	262616	262616	he	5148	“ It ’s Richter , ”
262624	262634	262616	262616	he	5148	“ I ’m being charged with Richter ’s murder . ”
262660	262666	262667	262667	I	5148	“ But it was suicide , ”
262670	262675	262667	262667	I	5148	“ And years ago . ”
262676	262691	262697	262697	He	5148	“ They ’re relying in part on the fact that I inherited his money . ”
262692	262696	262667	262667	I	5148	“ You did ? ”
262700	262745	262697	262697	He	5148	“ My first million . It was kept out of the press . I paid Charles a good portion of that money to make sure it stayed out of the press . My enemies will argue that a million dollars is a strong motive . ”
262746	262761	262697	262697	He	5148	“ That ’s what they ’re arguing ? But you were just a kid . ”
262797	262805	262778	262779	Damien Stark	5148	“ And you were already making money . ”
262806	262814	262697	262697	He	5148	“ Most people with money want more . ”
262815	262823	262824	262824	I	5148	“ It ’s still a ridiculous argument , ”
262827	262851	262824	262824	I	5148	“ He probably left you the money for the same reason he killed himself . He felt guilty for being an abusive slimebag . ”
262852	262868	262869	262869	Damien	5148	“ I ’m not sure Richter ever felt a moment of guilt in his life , ”
262872	262892	262869	262869	Damien	5148	“ At any rate , I believe they ’re putting more stock in the witness than into the money . ”
262893	262900	262697	262697	He	5148	“ So who is this witness ? ”
262901	262981	262869	262869	Damien	5148	“ A janitor . Elias Schmidt . He actually came forward right after Richter died , but my father paid him off and he disappeared before he said anything to the police . Evelyn was around during all of that . So was Charles . There was a tell - all book in the works that was going with the hypothesis that I ’d killed my coach . They got it shut down and the rumors locked up tight . ”
262991	263004	262982	262982	I	5148	“ So the janitor was paid off , but he came back ? ”
263005	263008	263009	263009	Damien	5148	“ No , ”
263012	263032	263009	263009	Damien	5148	“ He did n’t come back . The German police found out about him and they went to him . ”
263033	263036	262982	262982	I	5148	“ How ? ”
263037	263043	263044	263044	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
263082	263091	263075	263075	he	5148	“ But I think my father tipped them . ”
263097	263110	263092	263092	I	5148	“ What ? Why ? Why on earth would he do that ? ”
263111	263123	263075	263075	he	5148	“ To punish me for not giving him any more money . ”
263160	263214	263156	263156	I	5148	“ But they ’ll cave once you put on your defense . It ’ll be fine . I mean , it will cost you a boatload of money , but you have about a billion boats of money , right ? And you ’re innocent , so eventually they ’ll drop the charges . ”
263215	263219	263220	263220	Damien	5148	“ Money helps , ”
263223	263243	263244	263244	he	5148	“ but it ’s not a guarantee . And innocent people get convicted all the time . And besides , ”
263258	263264	263244	263244	he	5148	“ I ’m not innocent . ”
263281	263286	263287	263287	I	5148	“ No . No , ”
263290	263304	263287	263287	I	5148	“ Richter killed himself . He jumped off a building and committed suicide . ”
263318	263327	263287	263287	I	5148	“ He fell to his death , yes . ”
263440	263443	263444	263444	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
263452	263461	263462	263462	He	5148	“ I ’m sorry . I ’ll go . ”
263471	263474	263444	263444	he	5148	“ No . ”
263495	263548	263483	263483	I	5148	“ Do n’t leave me . You did what you had to do . What your father should have done , the bastard . I swear if I ’d been around back then and knew what that son of a bitch was doing to you , I would have killed him myself . ”
263569	263576	263577	263577	I	5148	“ Tell me exactly what happened , ”
263746	263749	263750	263750	He	5148	“ Damien ? ”
263771	263852	263853	263853	He	5148	“ It started when I was nine . The touching . The threats . I wo n’t tell you the details — I do n’t want those memories in my head , much less in yours . But I will tell you it was horrible . I hated him . I hated my father . And I hated myself . Not because I was ashamed — I was never ashamed . But because I had no power to stop him . ”
263858	263885	263853	263853	He	5148	“ I learned how important power is . It ’s the only thing that can truly protect you , and back then , I had none . ”
263905	263946	263947	263947	He	5148	“ It went on for years . I grew bigger and stronger , but he was a huge man , and as I got older he added more threats to his repertoire . He had photographs . And there were — ”
263955	263964	263947	263947	He	5148	“ There were other things that he threatened . ”
263965	263969	263970	263970	I	5148	“ What changed ? ”
263998	264010	264011	264011	His	243	“ All that time he never — he never raped me . ”
264024	264116	264117	264117	Damien	5148	“ When I was fourteen , we were in Germany at a tennis center in Munich . I went up to the courts on the roof one night — I do n’t remember why . I could n’t sleep , I was antsy . Whatever . He came up , too . He ’d been drinking . I could smell it on him . I tried to go back down , and he blocked me . He tried — for the first time he tried to take his sick games further . ”
264122	264129	264117	264117	Damien	5148	“ I did n’t let him . ”
264130	264138	264139	264139	I	5148	“ You pushed him off the roof ? ”
264153	264156	264157	264157	he	5148	“ No , ”
264164	264168	264160	264160	I	5148	“ What happened ? ”
264169	264173	264174	264174	he	5148	“ We fought , ”
264177	264349	264174	264174	he	5148	“ I hit him with my racquet . He grabbed it out of my hands . Smacked me across the back of my head with it — I’m lucky the wound was n’t visible , or the police might have been more interested in me at the time . But it was a nasty fight — and we were at the edge of the roof , an area without the fencing that was by the courts to keep stray balls from going over . I do n’t remember exactly what happened . He lunged for me , and I got a good shove in . He stumbled backward and then tripped over something , I ’m still not sure what . He was drunk , so maybe it was his own two feet . He went over , but he managed to grab the ledge . He was hanging there , and I was frozen to the spot . I could n’t move . He called for me to help him . ”
264359	264406	264407	264407	He	5148	“ I just stood there . He screamed for me , and I can remember the way my head was still throbbing from his blow , but I took one step toward him . One step , and then I stopped . And then he fell . ”
264422	264452	264407	264407	He	5148	“ I went back to my room , but I did n’t sleep . The next morning the assistant coach burst in with the news that Richter was dead . ”
264453	264461	264462	264462	I	5148	“ They ca n’t possibly convict you , ”
264465	264471	264462	264462	I	5148	“ You did nothing wrong . ”
264472	264484	264485	264485	he	5148	“ There was a moment when I could have saved him , ”
264488	264501	264485	264485	he	5148	“ I could have moved faster . I could have reached him . ”
264502	264515	264516	264516	I	5148	“ Do n’t you dare feel guilty for ‘ could have , ’ ”
264529	264543	264519	264519	His	5148	“ I do n’t . I do n’t regret it for an instant . ”
264544	264563	264485	264485	he	5148	“ Damien , do n’t you see ? You just need to tell the police all of this . ”
264564	264574	264519	264519	His	5148	“ All of what ? All of the abuse ? ”
264575	264578	264579	264579	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
264582	264585	264579	264579	I	5148	“ No . ”
264586	264589	264519	264519	His	5148	“ But — ”
264590	264597	264579	264579	I	5148	“ Nikki , I said no . ”
264605	264611	264598	264598	I	5148	“ So what happens now ? ”
264612	264649	264519	264519	His	5148	“ I called Charles from the limo . We ’re going to Munich tomorrow . The legal team is already in place . I ’m hoping that we ’ll be able to present a decent defense . ”
264650	264657	264598	264598	I	5148	“ You have a decent defense . ”
264658	264696	264519	264519	His	5148	“ Do n’t push me on that , Nikki . I ’m not making that aspect of my life public . Richter took a lot from me , but he ’s not taking my privacy , too . ”
264711	264720	264721	264721	I	5148	“ So the tennis center bigwigs in Germany , ”
264724	264750	264721	264721	I	5148	“ Charles and your dad were hoping that if you endorsed the Richter Tennis Center here that those folks would pull strings with the cops ? ”
264751	264756	264598	264598	I	5148	“ That ’s right . ”
264757	264767	264721	264721	I	5148	“ But you said your dad started it all . ”
264768	264777	264778	264778	Damien	5148	“ I said that I think he did , ”
264781	264861	264778	264778	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t know everything that goes on in my father ’s head , but I do know that before I settled with Padgett , he had at least two meetings with my father . Considering your conversation with Carl , I think he may have been involved , too . I think my father must have told Padgett about the janitor — Schmidt apparently witnessed our fight , though he left before Richter went off the roof . ”
264862	264876	264721	264721	I	5148	“ That was how Padgett was going to hurt you before you settled ? ”
264896	264908	264889	264889	he	2664	“ He was going to get the janitor to go public ? ”
264909	264998	264778	264778	Damien	5148	“ I think so . He ’d request more money for himself and for my father , who was pulling the strings . But then when Padgett settled , my dad was frustrated that the plan went awry . So he tipped the German police . I do n’t think he expected it to go this far . The case is very cold , after all , and was never officially treated as a murder . The threat was really to get my attention — and my money . ”
264999	265010	264889	264889	he	2664	“ But the German police heated it back up again . ”
265011	265083	264778	264778	Damien	5148	“ Yes . And so my father wanted me to appear squeaky clean . His house , his car , and much of his bank account are actually in my name . I get convicted — or I need funds for my defense — and all of that might go away . Worse for him , the public might find out that he was complicit in what Richter did to me . ”
265084	265094	265095	265095	I	5148	“ Your father is a son of a bitch , ”
265099	265102	265103	265103	Damien	5148	“ Yes , ”
265106	265110	265103	265103	Damien	5148	“ He is . ”
265111	265124	265125	265125	I	5148	“ But you ’re going to come out of this just fine . ”
265139	265146	265147	265147	he	5148	“ I ’m not so sure , ”
265150	265165	265147	265147	he	5148	“ But right now , I do n’t want to think about it anymore . ”
265177	265182	265166	265166	I	5148	“ Then do n’t . ”
265188	265195	265183	265183	He	5148	“ I should have told you . ”
265196	265199	265200	265200	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
265203	265211	265200	265200	I	5148	“ But you ’ve told me now . ”
265241	265255	265256	265256	he	5148	“ Do n’t ever forget how much you mean to me , Nikki , ”
265265	265279	265256	265256	he	5148	“ I wo n’t . But nothing ’s going to happen to you . ”
265306	265327	265297	265297	he	5148	“ You know that I will always protect you . That I will do whatever it takes to protect you . ”
265328	265331	265332	265332	I	5148	“ Stop , ”
265336	265359	265332	265332	I	5148	“ You wo n’t be convicted . You are n’t going to jail . You ’re staying right here . With me . ”
265389	265400	265401	265401	he	5148	“ I ’m going to make love to you tonight , ”
265404	265417	265401	265401	he	5148	“ Slow and sweet and as long as we can stand it . ”
265418	265427	265428	265428	I	5148	“ That will be a very long time , ”
265469	265474	265475	265475	I	5148	“ Take them off , ”
265478	265508	265475	265475	I	5148	“ I want to feel you . I want you against me . I want you so close that I ca n’t tell where I end and you begin . ”
265529	265534	265535	265535	he	5148	“ Yes , ma’am , ”
265651	265659	265660	265660	he	5148	“ What exactly does the lady want ? ”
265663	265670	265671	265671	I	5148	“ I want to touch you , ”
265674	265689	265671	265671	I	5148	“ I want to taste you . I want to take you to heaven . ”
265690	265695	265696	265696	he	5148	“ What a coincidence , ”
265706	265714	265700	265700	he	5148	“ I want exactly the same thing . ”
265749	265756	265757	265757	he	5148	“ I want to memorize you , ”
265760	265794	265757	265757	he	5148	“ Every line , every curve . The way you smell , the way you taste . I want to lock you in my memory so that I will never be without you . ”
265795	265800	265801	265801	I	5148	“ You never will , ”
265804	265807	265757	265757	he	5148	“ Nikki — ”
265903	265907	265908	265908	I	5148	“ No toys , ”
265918	265945	265908	265908	I	5148	“ No kink . No games . Just you inside me . That ’s all I want tonight , Damien . That ’s all I need . ”
265957	265966	265967	265967	he	5148	“ That ’s all I need , too , ”
265970	265999	265967	265967	he	5148	“ You , Nikki . You in my arms . You burned into my memory . You , drawing me in deep . Keeping me , claiming me . ”
266108	266111	266112	266112	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
266115	266127	266112	266112	I	5148	“ Now . Please , please , I need you now . ”
266180	266183	266184	266184	I	5148	“ Now , ”
266187	266197	266184	266184	I	5148	“ Damien , now . I need you now . ”
266198	266206	266207	266207	he	5148	“ I need you too , Nikki , ”
266824	266832	266833	266833	I	5148	“ I ’m going to the apartment , ”
266836	266841	266833	266833	I	5148	“ Buzz me up ? ”
266842	266849	266858	266861	the boss ’s girlfriend	3512	“ Of course , Ms. Fairchild . ”
266965	266968	266969	266969	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
267099	267102	267103	267103	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
267179	267182	267187	267187	his	5148	“ Nikki . ”
267219	267228	267229	267229	I	5148	“ I had to come say goodbye again , ”
267232	267239	267240	267240	he	5148	“ I ’m glad you did , ”
267243	267267	267240	267240	he	5148	“ I should n’t have left without saying goodbye to you . I ’m going to miss you more than you can imagine . ”
267308	267364	267303	267303	I	5148	“ I wanted you to know that what you told me last night changes nothing . I do n’t care if you pushed Richter off the roof on purpose . What he did to you was reprehensible , and I will stick by you , Damien . No matter what , I am not running . ”
267377	267382	267383	267383	he	5148	“ I believe you , ”
267386	267471	267472	267472	He	3519	“ Do you remember when you asked me to play our game again ? You said that you wanted to know that I could n’t leave you , no matter what I might learn about you . That you were afraid I ’d leave if I knew your secrets . Well , I ’m guessing I know pretty much everything now , and I ’m not going anywhere . I love you , Damien Stark . And I ’m staying right by your side . ”
267501	267509	267472	267472	He	3519	“ I know you wo n’t leave . ”
267510	267515	267516	267516	I	5148	“ I wo n’t , ”
267554	267561	267545	267545	I	5148	“ I wo n’t ever go . ”
267562	267576	267577	267577	I	5148	“ Which is why I have to be the one to leave you . ”
267607	267612	267613	267613	he	3519	“ I ’m sorry , ”
267634	267648	267627	267627	they	3521	“ I ’m breaking up with you , Nikki . It ’s over . ”
267767	267792	267793	267793	He	5148	“ I — No . No , it ’s never over . I ’m yours , Damien . Forever . You said so yourself . ”
267812	267817	267793	267793	He	5148	“ I was wrong . ”
267818	267832	267833	267833	I	5148	“ The hell you were . What the hell is going on here ? ”
267859	267877	267878	267878	His	5148	“ I told you that I would leave if that was what it took to protect you . ”
267892	267908	267878	267878	His	5148	“ Protect me ? Damien , we ’re doing fine . I ’m doing fine . ”
267909	267978	267878	267878	His	5148	“ You ’re not fine . You ’re a mess with all the press about the portrait , Nikki . Do n’t try to deny it . I saw the way you looked in the bathroom . You wanted to slice deep into your flesh . You were ready to break the mirror to get at the glass . You wanted blood , Nikki . You wanted pain . ”
268001	268009	267995	267995	I	5148	“ But I did n’t go there . ”
268010	268020	267990	267990	he	5148	“ It will get worse . It already has . ”
268031	268103	267995	267995	I	5148	“ The press , Nikki . They ’re not focusing on me . Damien Stark indicted for murder . You ’d think that would be interesting , right ? Apparently not as interesting as his girlfriend . Who , according to those assholes , is n’t really his girlfriend at all . Just an opportunistic little whore who ’ll sleep with anyone who can help her get ahead , murderers included . ”
268120	268126	268127	268127	I	5148	“ I do n’t care , ”
268130	268135	268127	268127	I	5148	“ I can deal . ”
268136	268143	268104	268104	My	5148	“ You should n’t have to . ”
268144	268189	268127	268127	I	5148	“ Dammit , Damien , I ’m not a mom - and - pop food company . Pulling out is n’t going to save me . You ’re going to destroy me . I need you . You . Do n’t you get that ? ”
268190	268211	268104	268104	My	5148	“ I ca n’t bear to see you broken . Not when I ’m the one who is breaking you . ”
268212	268218	268219	268219	I	5148	“ You are breaking me ! ”
268222	268239	268219	268219	I	5148	“ If you walk away from me , you ’re going to snap me in two . ”
268240	268243	268244	268244	he	5148	“ No , ”
268263	268278	268251	268251	I	5148	“ I thought you said I was strong . Or was that just bullshit ? ”
268279	268283	268284	268284	he	5148	“ You are , ”
268292	268344	268284	268284	he	5148	“ Strong enough to stay despite me dragging you into hell . I ’m the one who ’s weak , Nikki , because I kept you in the spotlight for too damn long . I could n’t leave you , and that hurt you . But I ’m fixing it now . ”
268493	268500	268501	268501	I	5148	“ Damn you , Damien Stark , ”
268504	268513	268501	268501	I	5148	“ Damn you for giving up on us . ”
268577	268582	268566	268566	I	5148	“ Goodbye , Nikki . ”
268628	268634	268635	268635	she	5962	“ Good God , Texas , ”
268644	268650	268638	268638	she	5962	“ What happened to you ? ”
268651	268656	268657	268657	I	5148	“ He left me , ”
268667	268681	268657	268657	I	5148	“ He thinks he ’s protecting me , and so he dumped me . ”
268687	268694	268695	268695	she	5962	“ Damn fool of a boy , ”
268698	268726	268695	268695	she	5962	“ I do n’t care what everyone says about him being a goddamned genius , he fucked this one up , Texas . He damn sure did . ”
268735	268745	268682	268682	She	5962	“ Aw , hell , girl , get inside . ”
268746	268751	268682	268682	She	5962	“ Is Blaine here ? ”
268752	268759	268760	268760	she	5962	“ He ’s in the studio , ”
268772	268782	268760	268760	she	5962	“ It ’s okay . Cry all you want . ”
268783	268791	268792	268792	I	5148	“ I do n’t want to cry , ”
268795	268814	268792	268792	I	5148	“ I want him back . But he ’s so damned convinced he ’s doing the right thing . ”
268815	268828	268829	268829	she	5962	“ What the hell does he think he ’s protecting you from ? ”
268846	268850	268832	268832	she	5962	“ The paparazzi . ”
268851	268854	268855	268855	she	5962	“ Phhht , ”
268858	268862	268855	268855	she	5962	“ Fuck ’em . ”
268863	268874	268875	268875	I	5148	“ I wish they were that easy to blow off . ”
268880	268887	268875	268875	I	5148	“ Blaine did n’t tell you ? ”
268888	268893	268855	268855	she	5962	“ Tell me what ? ”
268926	268931	268932	268932	I	5148	“ I have scars , ”
268940	268979	268936	268936	She	5962	“ There ’s one on the painting . On your hip . Looks to be some on your thighs , too , but the shadows make it hard to tell . So what happened to you , Texas ? ”
268983	268989	268936	268936	She	5962	“ I happened to me . ”
269068	269086	269059	269059	I	5148	“ You ’re saying that Damien thinks you ’re going to start up with the cutting again ? ”
269099	269102	269103	269103	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
269106	269124	269103	269103	I	5148	“ I haven’t — not since I ’ve been in LA . But I ’ve come close . ”
269125	269129	269130	269130	She	5962	“ The paparazzi ? ”
269148	269166	269103	269103	I	5148	“ And all this craziness about the painting . It — well , it got to me . ”
269167	269179	269103	269103	I	5148	“ Hell , that kind of crap would get to anyone . ”
269180	269201	269103	269103	I	5148	“ Now the press is saying all sorts of shit about me sleeping with a murderer , and Damien thinks — ”
269202	269229	269103	269103	I	5148	“ That he ’s got to be the hero and walk away . Goddamn the boy , you two are n’t supposed to be a tragedy . ”
269230	269234	269235	269235	I	5148	“ Trust me , ”
269239	269260	269235	269235	I	5148	“ I ’m not crazy about the last - minute script change , either . So what can I do ? ”
269261	269275	269103	269103	I	5148	“ You can haul your ass to Germany and get the boy back . ”
269276	269348	269235	269235	I	5148	“ But he ’ll just send me home again . He thinks he ’s being chivalrous , remember ? I have to prove to him I can handle it , but how ? It ’s not like I can go a year without cutting , and then say ‘ I told you so . ’ So what can I do to prove to him right now that I ’ll be okay ? ”
269349	269393	269103	269103	I	5148	“ Ah , now here ’s why you came to the right place . Because this is exactly the kind of sneaky shit you pick up after a lifetime in Hollywood . You just need to give the press nowhere else to go . ”
269394	269400	269235	269235	I	5148	“ I ’m not following . ”
269401	269418	269103	269103	I	5148	“ They ’re interested in you as a story . So make the story go away . ”
269451	269456	269438	269438	I	5148	“ You ’re brilliant . ”
269457	269476	269426	269426	she	3527	“ Damn right , I am . Why do you think I ’m a legend in this town ? ”
269477	269491	269438	269438	I	5148	“ Do you know someone who can handle the press side of things ? ”
269505	269512	269492	269492	Evelyn	5962	“ Just leave it to me . ”
269545	269553	269554	269554	Evelyn	5962	“ And what makes it really unique , ”
269560	269575	269554	269554	Evelyn	5962	“ is that everything you ’re going to say is one hundred percent true . ”
269651	269659	269639	269639	Evelyn	5962	“ You sure about this , Texas ? ”
269660	269675	269676	269676	I	5148	“ It ’s the only thing I can think of to get him back , ”
269679	269692	269676	269676	I	5148	“ And more important , I need to do it for me . ”
269696	269709	269693	269693	She	646	“ Okay , then . Let ’s make you even more famous . ”
269829	269890	269898	269899	The reporter	5108	“ My name is Nikki Fairchild , and I recently accepted one million dollars as a modeling fee for a nude Blaine original . The completed portrait now hangs in Mr. Damien Stark ’s Malibu home , and it is an exceptional piece of art . It is both tasteful and erotic . And it does not show my face . ”
269920	270025	269898	269899	The reporter	5108	“ I agreed to the painting , and to the million , because I needed the money . It has not been spent , nor will it be until I am ready . But I also insisted that the arrangement be confidential and that no one except Mr. Stark and the artist know that it was me in the portrait . Somehow , though , my identity has been revealed , and Mr. Stark and I have been harassed nonstop by reporters and photographers who apparently have nothing better to do with their time . And the truth is , now I have regrets . ”
270045	270151	270041	270041	I	5148	“ Not about the painting . Not about the money . No , my regret is that I asked Blaine and Mr. Stark to keep my identity confidential in the first place . I will admit that there was a time when I was ashamed of my body , but that time has passed . I think the portrait is outstanding . And I think the modeling fee was fair . Then again , what is a fair price to paint a woman ’s body ? If Mr. Stark had paid me ten dollars , would the press now be calling me a cheap harlot ? ”
270161	270195	270152	270152	I	5148	“ To be honest , I think Mr. Stark got off easy . If he wants a second nude portrait , he ’ll have to pay me two million dollars . At least . ”
270204	270277	270199	270200	the reporter	5108	“ As of this morning , the gossip about me has shifted . Apparently now I ’m a woman who would sleep with a murderer to get ahead . Let ’s think about that . Do I sleep with Damien Stark ? I do , and gladly , but not to get ahead . Instead , I am honored and humbled that he wants me in his life and in his bed . ”
270301	270359	270289	270289	I	5148	“ As for the allegation that Damien Stark is a murderer , I can only say that I do not believe it . The evidence will acquit him . But if by some horrific fault in the universe he is convicted , then that will change nothing . I will not and would not leave his side . ”
270373	270438	270360	270360	I	5148	“ I do not intend to make any more statements to the press , so I will add one final thing for the record . I am in love with Damien Stark , and I am leaving for Germany in an hour to support him through his trial . He is an innocent man , and he has been wrongly accused . Thank you . ”
270699	270703	270695	270695	Damien	5148	“ One minute ! ”
270770	270773	270791	270791	he	5148	“ Nikki . ”
270774	270785	270786	270786	I	5148	“ Do you want me to get that for you ? ”
270864	270871	270872	270872	he	5148	“ I saw your press conference , ”
270876	270879	270880	270880	I	5148	“ Oh ? ”
270914	270924	270906	270906	he	5148	“ I did n’t expect you here so quickly . ”
270925	270949	270950	270950	My	5148	“ When you know you want to be with someone you love , you want to get there as fast as you can . ”
271016	271021	270998	270998	he	5148	“ Oh , Nikki . ”
271040	271061	271033	271033	I	5148	“ No matter what you tell the press , you deserve better than a relationship with a man behind bars . ”
271062	271067	271068	271068	I	5148	“ I deserve you , ”
271071	271137	271068	271068	I	5148	“ But if you think I ca n’t handle all of this , then you ’re right . I ca n’t . Not without you . Damien , do n’t you get it ? I ca n’t just sit on the sidelines and watch them try you for murder . I need to be here . I have to be here . I need you . ”
271157	271167	271068	271068	I	5148	“ And I think you need me , too . ”
271184	271188	271189	271189	he	243	“ I do , ”
271195	271203	271189	271189	he	243	“ God , Nikki , I do . ”
271264	271273	271274	271274	My	5148	“ Then it ’s okay that I came ? ”
271281	271288	271289	271289	he	243	“ Oh , baby , yes , ”
271304	271320	271289	271289	he	243	“ You are my blood ; without you , I ’m nothing but a shell . ”
271321	271329	271330	271330	I	5148	“ You should never have walked away , ”
271333	271336	271337	271337	he	243	“ No , ”
271341	271444	271337	271337	he	243	“ I had to . I had to give you that one fair chance to get free of me . Because you will be drawn into hell , Nikki , and though you may think I ’m strong , where you are concerned I am weak . I am selfish . I walked away once to protect you , but I wo n’t do it again . If you want to go , do it now . Otherwise , I will keep you here beside me , because that is where I want you . By my side , Nikki . Always . ”
271460	271469	271470	271470	he	5148	“ I ’ve been in hell without you , ”
271473	271511	271470	271470	he	5148	“ Every minute was a fight against temptation . I wanted to send a plane for you . To say to hell with whatever was best for you and scoop you up for my own selfish needs . ”
271517	271528	271512	271512	I	5148	“ I think I would have been okay with that . ”
271529	271532	271533	271533	he	5148	“ No , ”
271544	271599	271533	271533	he	5148	“ I was so proud of you . Those things you said . The risks you took . You exorcised the demons , Nikki . The press may be an irritation , but you ’ve taken their power away . They ca n’t destroy you . Not about that . Maybe not about anything . ”
271600	271618	271619	271619	He	5148	“ It was easy . I just remembered how strong you ’re always telling me I am . ”
271660	271669	271670	271670	he	5148	“ I want to make love to you , ”
271673	271677	271678	271678	I	5148	“ Thank God , ”
271686	271692	271678	271678	I	5148	“ But we ca n’t . ”
271718	271728	271670	271670	he	5148	“ I have to go meet with my attorneys . ”
271729	271736	271693	271693	I	5148	“ Oh . Well , later ? ”
271737	271771	271670	271670	he	5148	“ Most definitely later . And for a very long time . But right now , would you come with me ? I want you beside me when I meet with the lawyers . ”
271772	271776	271777	271777	I	5148	“ Of course , ”
271780	271789	271777	271777	I	5148	“ So does this mean I can stay ? ”
271790	271796	271797	271797	He	5148	“ You damn well better . ”
271805	271808	271809	271809	I	5148	“ What ? ”
271812	271824	271777	271777	I	5148	“ I ’m just hoping that you ’re not a mirage . ”
271829	271834	271825	271825	My	5148	“ I ’m real . ”
271835	271839	271840	271840	he	5148	“ Prove it , ”
271859	271864	271865	271865	he	5148	“ Put it on , ”
271868	271872	271840	271840	he	5148	“ But how — ”
271873	271878	271879	271879	he	5148	“ I went back , ”
271905	271920	271879	271879	he	5148	“ I had to have you with me … even if only a talisman . ”
271921	271924	271925	271925	My	5148	“ Damien . ”
271946	271975	271935	271935	He	5148	“ Later . Say too much and we ’ll never get out of here . I want you right now — but I ca n’t miss this meeting . ”
271994	272017	271988	271988	He	5148	“ Just one more thing . When I said you could stay ? What I meant to say was I love you . ”

274078	274092	274029	274029	I	5148	“ He is . Shall I have a phone brought to his table ? ”
274093	274106	274029	274029	I	5148	“ No , that ’s all right . I ’ll come down . ”
274107	274121	274029	274029	I	5148	“ Sehr gut . Is there anything else I can do for you ? ”

274730	274738	274739	274739	He	5148	“ That depends on who ’s asking . ”
274933	274936	274937	274937	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
275011	275020	275021	275021	I	5148	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”

275355	275423	275424	275424	I	5148	“ You forget that I ’ve seen you in action , Damien Stark . You ’re a goddamn force of nature . They ca n’t possibly hold you . Maybe they do n’t know it yet , but I do . You ’re going to walk away from this . You ’re going home a free man . There ’s no other way that this can end . ”
275467	275484	275457	275457	he	5148	“ You should be scared . This is the kind of case that has prosecutors salivating . ”
275485	275492	275493	275493	I	5148	“ But you were only fourteen , ”
275496	275509	275457	275457	he	5148	“ Which is why they ’re not trying me as an adult . ”
275529	275538	275510	275510	I	5148	“ But you did n’t kill Merle Richter . ”

276328	276337	276324	276324	My	5148	“ Thank you . Your timing is perfect . ”
276392	276397	276385	276385	Damien	5148	“ What ’s this ? ”
276398	276438	276385	276385	Damien	5148	“ A rental . I thought you could use a little fun tonight , and the A9 ’s just a few miles away . Fast car . German autobahn . It seemed like a no - brainer to me . ”
276439	276445	276385	276385	Damien	5148	“ Boys and their toys ? ”
276458	276480	276446	276446	I	5148	“ Since we already have some interesting toys in the room , I thought you might enjoy a change of pace . ”
276496	276518	276481	276481	I	5148	“ I understand she ’s very responsive , and I know you ’ll enjoy having all that power at your command . ”
276519	276523	276524	276524	He	2175	“ Is she ? ”
276541	276561	276524	276524	He	2175	“ As a matter of fact , that ’s exactly what I like . Responsiveness . Power . Control . ”
276562	276566	276567	276567	I	5148	“ I know , ”
276606	276618	276619	276619	I	5148	“ Drive fast enough , and it ’s almost like sex , ”
276634	276646	276631	276631	I	5148	“ At the very least , it makes for exceptional foreplay . ”
276647	276655	276656	276656	he	2175	“ In that case , Ms. Fairchild , ”
276669	276677	276656	276656	he	2175	“ I suggest you hold on tight . ”
277225	277230	277231	277231	he	5148	“ You ’re smiling , ”
277241	277245	277246	277246	I	5148	“ I am , ”
277249	277255	277246	277246	I	5148	“ Because you ’re happy . ”
277256	277262	277263	277263	he	5148	“ I ’m with you , ”
277266	277274	277263	277263	he	5148	“ Why would n’t I be happy ? ”
277275	277279	277280	277280	I	5148	“ Keep talking , ”
277283	277290	277280	277280	I	5148	“ Flattery will get you everywhere . ”
277291	277297	277298	277298	His	5148	“ I certainly hope so . ”
277410	277415	277416	277416	Damien	5148	“ We ’re here , ”
277483	277490	277491	277491	he	5148	“ Do you have a plan ? ”
277514	277518	277498	277498	I	5148	“ A plan ? ”
277526	277545	277519	277519	His	5148	“ This was your idea , remember ? I thought you might have had something specific in mind . ”
277546	277550	277551	277551	I	5148	“ No plan , ”
277568	277578	277551	277551	I	5148	“ Nothing more than just cutting loose with you . ”
277579	277585	277586	277586	he	5148	“ I like that plan , ”
277589	277601	277602	277602	He	5148	“ And I know exactly where I want to get off . ”
277629	277632	277633	277633	I	5148	“ Perv , ”
277636	277641	277642	277642	he	5148	“ Only for you , ”
278111	278117	278118	278118	I	5148	“ We should head back , ”
278183	278188	278161	278161	Damien	5148	“ What is it ? ”
278189	278195	278196	278196	I	5148	“ We should go back . ”
278227	278232	278233	278233	I	5148	“ You need rest . ”
278246	278258	278233	278233	I	5148	“ Tomorrow ’s going to put us both through the wringer . ”
278259	278273	278286	278286	I	5148	“ All the more reason to keep going as long as we can . ”
278282	278285	278274	278274	I	5148	“ Damien . ”
278410	278413	278414	278414	He	5148	“ Soon . ”
278425	278431	278468	278468	I	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
278432	278440	278468	278468	I	5148	“ Someplace I want you to see . ”
278456	278467	278452	278452	he	5148	“ Do n’t worry . We ’re not running away . ”
278700	278703	278704	278704	I	5148	“ What ? ”
278714	278718	278704	278704	I	5148	“ What happened ? ”
278719	278726	278727	278727	Damien	5148	“ You had a nice nap , ”
278736	278740	278733	278733	I	5148	“ How long ? ”
278741	278747	278704	278704	I	5148	“ Almost half an hour . ”
278795	278800	278733	278733	I	5148	“ Where are we ? ”
278801	278805	278806	278806	he	5148	“ Seehaus Kranzberger , ”
278822	278868	278869	278869	he	5148	“ This used to be one of my favorite places near Munich . Alaine and Sofia and I used to come here once Alaine was old enough to drive . Later , I would come by myself . There are a lot of memories here , ”
278879	278885	278886	278886	I	5148	“ But it ’s closed , ”
278890	278899	278900	278900	he	5148	“ We did n’t come for the food , ”
278937	278943	278922	278922	He	5148	“ Why did we come ? ”
278944	278949	278922	278922	He	5148	“ Walk with me . ”
279058	279063	279064	279064	I	5148	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
279067	279080	279081	279081	he	5148	“ Welcome to Kranzberger See . I used to spend hours here , ”
279084	279115	279116	279116	He	5148	“ I would sit on the bank and listen to the water and the birds and the wind in the trees . I would close my eyes and get lost . ”
279133	279140	279141	279141	he	5148	“ I wanted to show you , ”
279161	279165	279153	279153	I	5148	“ Thank you . ”
279358	279361	279371	279371	he	243	“ Nikki . ”
279433	279467	279422	279422	he	243	“ I pissed you off that first night at Evelyn ’s , remember ? I should have let you stay pissed . I should have walked away from you and never looked back . ”
279526	279529	279530	279530	I	5148	“ No , ”
279562	279575	279549	279549	He	243	“ It rips me apart to see the fear in your eyes . ”
279619	279623	279624	279624	I	5148	“ Stop it ! ”
279642	279702	279624	279624	I	5148	“ Just fucking stop it ! You think that ’s a solution ? Wishing that we ’d never gotten together ? Goddammit , Damien , I ’m so in love with you it hurts , but you ’re going to fucking coddle me ? I do n’t need you to soothe me , I need you to do something . ”
279733	279736	279737	279737	His	243	“ Nikki . ”
279825	279836	279837	279837	My	5148	“ They ’re going to put you in a cage . ”
279844	279871	279837	279837	My	5148	“ Christ , Damien , how can you not be scared shitless ? I ’m so scared I can barely get out of bed every day ! ”
279883	279887	279872	279872	He	243	“ Not afraid ? ”
279921	279928	279918	279918	him	243	“ Is that what you think ? ”
279960	280010	279947	279947	his	243	“ Is that really what you think ? Jesus Christ , Nikki , I ’m terrified of being ripped away from you . Of not being able to touch you . To kiss you . To hear you laugh , to look at you . To be with you . ”
280094	280106	280083	280083	He	243	“ I can handle anything except the thought of losing you . ”
280135	280139	280140	280140	he	243	“ Not scared ? ”
280186	280200	280201	280201	he	243	“ I ’m more terrified than I ’ve ever been in my life , ”
280317	280365	280366	280366	He	5148	“ How dare you be afraid . Goddammit , Damien , how dare you say that you ’re afraid of losing me when you could make it all go away . You could make this be over . You could end it and we could go home . ”
280381	280397	280366	280366	He	5148	“ Oh , baby . If I could take away your fear , I would . ”
280398	280403	280404	280404	I	5148	“ If you could ? ”
280407	280433	280404	280404	I	5148	“ You can , and you damn well know it , and I ’m fucking pissed off that you wo n’t do anything about it . ”
280542	280549	280550	280550	His	5148	“ I ’ve thought about it . ”
280582	280587	280588	280588	I	5148	“ Thought about what ? ”
280617	280626	280627	280627	he	5148	“ I ’ve wanted you for so long , ”
280630	280647	280627	280627	he	5148	“ And now that I have you , I ’m risking everything there is between us . ”
280698	280759	280765	280765	his	5148	“ I ’m not convinced that revealing what Richter did to me is the panacea you and Maynard and the rest of them think it is . But maybe I should try . If it means that the charges will go away , then maybe I should sacrifice the privacy that I ’ve spent my whole life fighting to maintain . ”
280796	280866	280867	280867	He	5148	“ There is no shame in being a victim , right ? So why should I care if the world knows the vile things he did to me ? Why should it matter if the press writes about the dark nights in my dorm room . The debasing things he made me do . Things I have n’t even told you . Things that I wish I could forget . ”
280885	280950	280867	280867	He	5148	“ If it means that I can walk to you as a free man , should n’t I want to shout that story from the rooftops ? Should n’t I want it plastered everywhere ? On television , on talk shows , on the front page of newspapers ? Should n’t I want to make my personal hell fodder for the whole damn world ? ”
280965	280968	280969	280969	I	5148	“ No , ”
281014	281020	281021	281021	I	5148	“ Not even for me , ”
281024	281033	281021	281021	I	5148	“ Not even to stay out of prison . ”
281058	281062	281071	281071	I	5148	“ You understand ? ”
281063	281066	281067	281067	I	5148	“ No , ”
281316	281336	281302	281302	I	5148	“ You are my everything , Nikki . You have to know that . You have to believe it . ”
281337	281341	281342	281342	I	5148	“ I do , ”
281388	281394	281395	281395	he	5148	“ You are my everything , ”
281398	281415	281395	281395	he	5148	“ But I ca n’t be true to you if I ’m not true to myself . ”
281416	281420	281421	281421	I	5148	“ I know , ”
281433	281438	281421	281421	I	5148	“ I get it . ”
281451	281461	281439	281439	I	5148	“ That does n’t mean it hurts any less . ”
281462	281472	281473	281473	He	5148	“ Then let me try to make it better . ”
281492	281499	281473	281473	He	5148	“ Is that where it hurts ? ”
281521	281529	281530	281530	His	5148	“ No ? Then how about here ? ”
281551	281554	281555	281555	I	5148	“ No , ”
281602	281610	281611	281611	I	5148	“ That ’s not it , either , ”
281614	281617	281618	281618	he	5148	“ Tricky , ”
281621	281639	281618	281618	he	5148	“ How can I kiss it and make it better if I ca n’t even find it ? ”
281640	281644	281645	281645	I	5148	“ Keep looking , ”
281648	281654	281655	281655	he	5148	“ I ’ll never stop , ”
281674	281680	281681	281681	he	5148	“ Not here , surely , ”
281710	281713	281702	281702	his	5148	“ Damien ! ”
281755	281758	281759	281759	he	5148	“ Here ? ”
281769	281772	281773	281773	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
281776	281783	281773	281773	I	5148	“ Oh , God , yes . ”
281784	281791	281792	281792	he	5148	“ I ’m not so sure , ”
281802	281809	281792	281792	he	5148	“ I ’d better keep looking . ”
281832	281835	281836	281836	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
281839	281844	281836	281836	I	5148	“ What are you — ”
281869	281874	281875	281875	he	5148	“ I told you , ”
281878	281890	281875	281875	he	5148	“ I ’m going to kiss it and make it better . ”
282328	282331	282332	282332	he	5148	“ Better ? ”
282339	282344	282345	282345	I	5148	“ Oh , yes , ”
282361	282364	282365	282365	he	5148	“ No , ”
282368	282372	282365	282365	he	5148	“ Lay back . ”
282380	282395	282373	282373	I	5148	“ So demanding , Mr. Stark . What exactly do you want from me ? ”
282396	282402	282403	282403	he	5148	“ I want you naked , ”
282433	282436	282439	282439	he	5148	“ Oh . ”
282494	282550	282470	282470	He	5148	“ I ’m going to fuck you , Nikki . Right here , on the warm earth with the sky open above us . I ’m going to claim you with the entire universe looking on , because you are mine , and you always will be , no matter where we go from here . ”
282551	282554	282555	282555	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
282569	282574	282555	282555	I	5148	“ Oh , yes . ”
282727	282730	282713	282713	He	5148	“ Now . ”
282831	282834	282835	282835	he	5148	“ Baby , ”
282842	282847	282848	282848	I	5148	“ No , no , ”
282851	282864	282848	282848	I	5148	“ It ’s just that it ’s too big to hold inside . ”
282865	282869	282870	282870	he	5148	“ I know , ”
282878	282884	282870	282870	he	5148	“ Sweetheart , I know . ”
282930	282938	282913	282913	Damien	5148	“ Are you ready to go back ? ”
282987	282992	282993	282993	I	5148	“ I ’m ready , ”
282996	283001	282993	282993	I	5148	“ Let ’s go . ”
283573	283576	283577	283577	he	5148	“ Wait , ”
283584	283587	283577	283577	he	5148	“ Here . ”
283660	283665	283647	283647	him	5148	“ I love you , ”
283688	283692	283693	283693	he	5148	“ I know , ”
283696	283703	283693	283693	he	5148	“ Now put the jacket on . ”
283897	283908	283863	283863	I	5148	“ Herr Stark ! Fräulein Fairchild ! Nikki ! Damien ! ”
284168	284184	284163	284163	He	5148	“ If I could have left you in the hotel today , I would have . ”
284185	284197	284200	284200	I	5148	“ I ’d rather die than not be here with you . ”
284331	284360	284316	284316	He	5148	“ Hello , Nikki . My staff will be in the row of seats immediately behind the witness stand . You ’ll sit there too , of course . ”
284381	284389	284390	284390	he	5148	“ We should talk before this begins , ”
284404	284410	284399	284399	He	5148	“ You ’ll excuse us ? ”
284449	284454	284455	284455	he	5148	“ Go on in , ”
284458	284465	284455	284455	he	5148	“ I ’ll see you shortly . ”
284762	284774	284775	284775	I	5148	“ I did n’t know you were going to be here , ”
284779	284791	284792	284792	he	837	“ I tried to reach you at the Kempinski this morning , ”
284795	284802	284792	284792	he	837	“ but you ’d already left . ”
284803	284810	284811	284811	I	5148	“ I have a cell phone , ”
284817	284856	284814	284814	He	837	“ I know . I should have called . This was last minute . Maynard learned that I went to school with one of the junior attorneys on the prosecutor ’s staff , and he wanted me here . ”
284857	284861	284862	284862	I	5148	“ Law school ? ”
284885	284893	284880	284880	He	837	“ Undergrad . Small world , huh ? ”
284894	284902	284903	284903	My	5148	“ Does Damien know you ’re here ? ”

295158	295166	295167	295167	he	5422	“ Have a good day , Fräulein , ”
295173	295186	295167	295167	he	5422	“ And please tell Mr. Stark how happy I am for him . ”
295187	295191	295192	295192	I	5148	“ I will , ”
295677	295689	295670	295670	she	5962	“ You have come to the right place , Ms. Fairchild . ”
296387	296401	296380	296381	the salesgirl	3313	“ I found something else you might like . May I come in ? ”
296402	296407	296408	296408	I	5148	“ Sure . Thanks . ”
296472	296475	296476	296476	His	3928	“ Oh ! ”
296540	296550	296551	296551	he	3928	“ I thought you might need a second opinion , ”
296563	296573	296574	296574	I	5148	“ I — yes . That would be great . ”
296601	296611	296582	296582	My	5148	“ Um , are you allowed to be here ? ”
296612	296617	296618	296618	He	3928	“ Apparently I am . ”
296649	296654	296655	296655	His	3928	“ I ’m sorry . ”
296664	296675	296676	296676	I	5148	“ You do n’t have anything to be sorry for , ”
296700	296710	296686	296686	I	5148	“ How did you know where to find me ? ”
296758	296771	296772	296772	His	3928	“ I ’ve told you before that I ’ll always find you . ”
296963	296975	296976	296976	I	5148	“ We ’re going to end up in the tabloids again , ”
296984	297001	296979	296979	He	3928	“ I can be very persuasive when I try . She wo n’t say a thing . ”
297002	297017	296979	296979	He	3928	“ Is that a fact ? Just how persuasive were you , Mr. Stark ? ”
297018	297028	297029	297029	His	3928	“ Persuasive to the tune of a thousand euros . ”
297036	297055	297056	297056	he	3928	“ She ’ll ensure our privacy . From the press and from her own curiosity . Of course , ”
297067	297087	297056	297056	he	3928	“ the more interesting question is what does she think is going on in this small , private room ? ”
297088	297099	297100	297100	I	5148	“ I ’m sure she has a very vivid imagination , ”
297104	297107	297108	297108	Damien	5148	“ Really ? ”
297115	297126	297127	297127	he	3928	“ Maybe she thinks I ’m touching you like this , ”
297236	297248	297249	297249	he	3928	“ Or maybe she ’s imagining my mouth on your breasts , ”
297263	297313	297249	297249	he	3928	“ Or maybe she ’s a bit more naughty , and she ’s picturing my hand sliding down your abdomen , your skin quivering beneath my fingers , your breath coming faster and faster until my fingertip finds the tiny bit of elastic that is holding those panties up . ”
297332	297335	297336	297336	His	3928	“ Damien . ”
297388	297427	297383	297383	I	5148	“ Does she wonder if I ’m easing my hand down , if my finger is skimming lightly over your damp pubic hair ? Does she know how hard your clit is , how turned on you are ? ”
297452	297477	297435	297435	He	3928	“ Does she know how wet and ready you are for me ? Does she know how much you want to come for me ? ”
297505	297513	297514	297514	he	3928	“ Is this what she ’s imagining ? ”
297525	297543	297514	297514	he	3928	“ My fingers inside you , playing with you , making you just a little bit crazy ? ”
297643	297649	297650	297650	he	5148	“ Come on , baby , ”
297653	297658	297650	297650	he	5148	“ Come for me . ”
297733	297742	297743	297743	he	5148	“ Was that what she ’s been imagining ? ”
297746	297761	297743	297743	he	5148	“ That salesgirl who knows there ’s something naughty going on behind this door ? ”
297774	297778	297779	297779	I	5148	“ Not quite , ”
297782	297795	297779	297779	I	5148	“ She ’s imagining your hands on her , not on me . ”
297796	297800	297801	297801	His	5148	“ Is she ? ”
297834	297845	297823	297823	Damien	5148	“ Well , she can have whatever fantasies she wants . ”
297855	297861	297846	297846	He	5148	“ You ’re my reality . ”
297862	297868	297869	297869	I	5148	“ And you ’re mine , ”
297934	297948	297949	297949	Damien	5148	“ Of course , there is one small matter we need to discuss , ”
297992	298010	297976	297976	He	5148	“ I seem to recall a certain agreement that ensured unfettered access whenever and however I wanted . ”
298022	298049	298011	298011	I	5148	“ Unless I was imagining all that just happened , I think it ’s fair to say that these panties do n’t fetter in the least . ”
298094	298113	298085	298085	I	5148	“ Besides , what ’s the point of having rules if you do n’t break them on occasion ? ”
298114	298121	298122	298122	He	5148	“ You make an interesting point . ”
298355	298358	298359	298359	he	5148	“ Interesting , ”
298452	298492	298433	298433	He	5148	“ I think perhaps it ’s time to amend our deal , Ms. Fairchild . As much as I appreciate the possibilities associated with complete access , there is something to be said for the pleasure of the journey . ”
298501	298505	298506	298506	he	5148	“ Come here , ”
298514	298522	298523	298523	I	5148	“ I ’ll go with you anywhere , ”
298526	298540	298523	298523	I	5148	“ I ’ll do anything for you . You know that , right ? ”
298641	298648	298624	298624	He	5148	“ I thought you ’d gone . ”
298674	298684	298685	298685	he	5148	“ I woke up and you were n’t there , ”
298690	298715	298685	298685	he	5148	“ I talked to Charles and he told me you ’d come by . That he ’d told you about the photos and videos . ”
298725	298740	298716	298716	He	5148	“ I thought you were so disgusted by them that you ’d left me . ”
298747	298757	298758	298758	I	5148	“ I was n’t the one who went away , ”
298767	298778	298758	298758	I	5148	“ You ’re the one who left . I stayed . ”
298786	298799	298779	298779	I	5148	“ I stayed because I knew you would come back to me . ”
298800	298807	298808	298808	he	5148	“ I will always come back , ”
298831	298839	298840	298840	I	5148	“ I did n’t see the photos , ”
298843	298866	298840	298840	I	5148	“ But no matter what is in them , I would never have left you . I just thought you needed sleep . ”
298898	298905	298906	298906	he	5148	“ I wanted you , Nikki , ”
298917	298971	298906	298906	he	5148	“ I wanted to pull you close and strip you naked . I wanted to tie you up and run my fingers over every inch of you . I wanted to bury my face between your legs and bring you to the brink over and over again , never quite letting you come . ”
298983	299077	299098	299098	He	3940	“ I wanted every sensation you experienced — every spark of pleasure , every hint of pain — to come from me . I wanted to fuck you until you begged me to stop and then I wanted to fuck you some more . Everything you felt , everything you wanted , everything you desired — I wanted it to be wrapped up in my touch , in my bed . I wanted to fuck you until there was nothing left but you and me . Until the whole goddamn world was erased . ”
299078	299084	299085	299085	My	5148	“ Why did n’t you ? ”
299123	299143	299103	299103	I	5148	“ Whatever you need from me , all you have to do is take it . You know that . ”
299144	299149	299150	299150	he	3940	“ I could n’t , ”
299159	299178	299150	299150	he	3940	“ I could n’t bear to have you in my arms when those images were in my head . ”
299179	299184	299185	299185	I	5148	“ I — oh . ”
299232	299312	299224	299224	he	3940	“ Those images are like scenes from a horror movie . They show what Richter did , and how he did it . They show degradation and they show pain , and I will never , ever put those images in your hands . I wo n’t let you look at even one of them . Imagine what you want , but I do n’t want the reality of my past haunting your present the way they haunt mine . ”
299313	299317	299318	299318	I	5148	“ All right , ”
299344	299366	299338	299338	I	5148	“ But , Damien , if it will help you , then show them to me . I can handle it . ”
299367	299370	299371	299371	he	3943	“ No , ”
299381	299427	299428	299428	he	3943	“ I do n’t want you to have to handle it . That ’s the horror of my past . But you … you ’re the reality of my present . You ’re the proof that I survived . The prize in the cereal box , ”
299440	299449	299428	299428	he	3943	“ Hopefully you wo n’t see them anyway . ”
299450	299455	299428	299428	he	3943	“ Why would I ? ”
299456	299469	299428	299428	he	3943	“ Whoever sent that evidence to the court must still have copies . ”
299491	299523	299428	299428	he	3943	“ But surely that person will protect them , right ? I mean , those pictures have existed for almost two decades . They only surfaced when you were in trouble . ”
299524	299529	299530	299530	Damien	5148	“ In my experience , ”
299533	299543	299530	299530	Damien	5148	“ unearthed things have a tendency to remain unearthed . ”
299551	299561	299544	299544	I	5148	“ Do you have any idea who it was ? ”
299562	299565	299544	299544	I	5148	“ No . ”
299574	299586	299587	299587	I	5148	“ There ca n’t be that many people who know about — ”
299610	299626	299602	299602	I	5148	“ Your father , maybe ? He was desperate to keep you from being tried . ”
299654	299659	299660	299660	Damien	5148	“ It ’s possible , ”
299675	299686	299687	299687	I	5148	“ I just want it to be over for you , ”
299702	299709	299687	299687	I	5148	“ You deserve happiness , Damien . ”
299710	299715	299716	299716	he	5148	“ So do you , ”
299740	299750	299751	299751	I	5148	“ Then it ’s lucky we found each other , ”
299832	299842	299843	299843	he	5148	“ Do you know what I want right now ? ”
299846	299854	299855	299855	I	5148	“ Probably the same thing I do , ”
299869	299879	299855	299855	I	5148	“ But we ’re still in a dressing room . ”
299888	299902	299880	299880	He	5148	“ I believe I explained how much privacy a thousand euros can buy . ”
299903	299909	299910	299910	I	5148	“ You explained very well , ”
299913	299937	299910	299910	I	5148	“ But we have a lot of celebrating to do . And you deserve more than a fast fuck in a dressing room . ”
299938	299953	299880	299880	He	5148	“ As it happens , it ’s not a fast fuck that I want . ”
299954	299957	299958	299958	I	5148	“ Oh ? ”
299983	299990	299969	299969	I	5148	“ What exactly do you want ? ”
300025	300028	300029	300029	he	5148	“ You , ”
300033	300080	300029	300029	he	5148	“ I want you naked , Nikki . Naked and hot and wet for me . I want to hear you moan . Hell , I want to hear you beg . And I promise you , baby , there will be nothing fast about it . ”
300082	300085	300086	300086	he	5148	“ There , ”
300135	300140	300141	300141	he	5148	“ That ’s it , ”
300144	300182	300141	300141	he	5148	“ I want to watch as the sky darkens and the city lights rise behind you . I want to see the sunset reflected on your skin and the glitter of the nightlife shining in your hair . ”
300449	300452	300453	300453	he	3947	“ Yes , ”
300467	300496	300453	300453	he	3947	“ This is how I want to see you , standing naked before the world . I want to look at you and know that you are mine . ”
300497	300503	300504	300504	My	5148	“ You know I am . ”
300513	300517	300518	300518	he	3947	“ Say it , ”
300521	300526	300527	300527	I	5148	“ I ’m yours , ”
300658	300663	300664	300664	He	5148	“ Come with me . ”
300782	300785	300786	300786	he	5148	“ No , ”
300813	300818	300819	300819	I	5148	“ But the window , ”
300834	300839	300819	300819	I	5148	“ The other buildings . ”
300840	300864	300865	300865	I	5148	“ No one is watching . The glass is tinted , and there are no lights in here . No one can see . ”
300869	300876	300877	300877	His	5148	“ But even if they could … ”
300998	301007	301008	301008	he	5148	“ What if that ’s what I wanted ? ”
301082	301103	301104	301104	He	5148	“ What if I want you naked before the world , your legs parted , your cunt wet for me ? ”
301212	301215	301221	301221	me	5148	“ Damien — ”
301223	301229	301230	301230	he	5148	“ Does it excite you ? ”
301256	301297	301298	301298	He	5148	“ Not knowing who might be watching , but knowing that I want you like this ? That I want the whole goddamned universe to look down on us and know that no matter what , you belong to me ? ”
301368	301384	301362	301362	I	5148	“ I want you to tell me , Nikki . Does it turn you on ? ”
301396	301400	301401	301401	I	5148	“ Keep going , ”
301404	301412	301401	301401	I	5148	“ Touch me and see for yourself . ”
301435	301444	301422	301422	His	5148	“ Not unless I hear you say it . ”
301445	301448	301449	301449	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
301471	301476	301468	301468	he	5148	“ Me , too . ”
301562	301568	301556	301556	he	5148	“ What are you — ? ”
301569	301572	301573	301573	he	5148	“ Shhh , ”
301576	301593	301594	301594	he	5148	“ Lean forward , hands on the window . No , do n’t argue . Beautiful , ”
301612	301626	301627	301627	he	5148	“ Now spread your legs for me . Oh , God , Nikki , ”
301630	301642	301627	301627	he	5148	“ Do you have any idea how much I want you ? ”
301643	301648	301649	301649	He	5148	“ You have me . ”
301685	301689	301690	301690	he	5148	“ I do , ”
301693	301704	301690	301690	he	5148	“ But I ’m not taking you . Not yet . ”
301773	301778	301779	301779	he	5148	“ I like this , ”
301801	301872	301779	301779	he	5148	“ It is said that oysters are a potent aphrodisiac , but I think that pearls are equally enticing . It ’s rumored that Cleopatra crushed one and drank it in wine in order to render herself irresistible to Mark Antony . But I think I prefer them as an adornment . For that matter , I can think of a few other adornments that I would like to see . ”
301873	301876	301877	301877	I	5148	“ Damien — ”
301895	301899	301900	301900	he	5148	“ Stay put , ”
301903	301944	301900	301900	he	5148	“ Do n’t touch yourself . Do n’t put your legs together . You ’ll come when I let you , Nikki , but not before . Break my rules , and I promise you wo n’t like the punishment . ”
301950	301957	301945	301945	I	5148	“ But where are you going ? ”
302219	302222	302223	302223	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
302230	302236	302223	302223	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
302286	302298	302284	302284	he	5148	it—“What I want , Nikki . Always , what I want . ”
302304	302310	302299	302299	I	5148	“ And what is that ? ”
302311	302317	302318	302318	He	5148	“ To give you pleasure . ”
302335	302341	302318	302318	He	5148	“ Do you remember this ? ”
302417	302422	302423	302423	he	5148	“ Oh , yes , ”
302426	302434	302423	302423	he	5148	“ I think you remember just fine . ”
302444	302451	302438	302438	he	5148	“ How did those get here ? ”
302460	302491	302452	302452	His	5148	“ It ’s been almost a month , Nikki . I had Gregory pack and ship a few things . Including the small leather case I keep in my closet . ”
302492	302495	302496	302496	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
302501	302509	302496	302496	I	5148	“ That was very efficient of you . ”
302510	302521	302522	302522	He	5148	“ I ’m a man who likes to plan ahead . ”
302584	302587	302588	302588	I	5148	“ Damien . ”
302710	302720	302721	302721	he	5148	“ We ’ve gone so far together , Nikki , ”
302730	302759	302721	302721	he	5148	“ I ’m going to take you even farther . I want to balance on the edge with you , and see you open and wide and wild . ”
302810	302820	302821	302821	he	5148	“ I want to give you everything , Nikki , ”
302842	302876	302821	302821	he	5148	“ I want the universe spread wide before you . And I want to be the one who sends you tumbling over , shooting off into space , without control , without inhibitions . ”
302899	302904	302905	302905	he	5148	“ And , Nikki , ”
302914	302929	302905	302905	he	5148	“ I want to be the one who tethers you and brings you back . ”
302930	302934	302935	302935	I	5148	“ You are , ”
302957	302975	302938	302938	I	5148	“ Oh , God , Damien , you know you are . I ’m lost without you . ”
303025	303028	303029	303029	I	5148	“ Please , ”
303074	303078	303079	303079	he	5148	“ Please what ? ”
303082	303091	303079	303079	he	5148	“ Tell me what you want , Nikki . ”
303092	303110	303111	303111	I	5148	“ You , Damien . Always you — only you . I want you to touch me . ”
303125	303149	303111	303111	I	5148	“ I want you to fuck me because I ’m not entirely sure I can survive without feeling you inside me right now . ”
303150	303157	303158	303158	he	5148	“ I want that , too , ”
303167	303180	303181	303181	he	5148	“ But we ’re going to have to risk your imminent demise , ”
303189	303199	303181	303181	he	5148	“ Because I have something else in mind first . ”
303495	303500	303501	303501	Damien	5148	“ You ’re glowing , ”
303514	303517	303518	303518	I	5148	“ Glowing ? ”
303521	303531	303518	303518	I	5148	“ Jesus , Damien , I ’m practically radioactive . ”
303532	303535	303536	303536	he	5148	“ Mmm , ”
303545	303550	303551	303551	He	5148	“ So I see . ”
303583	303592	303569	303569	He	5148	“ A bit on edge , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
303593	303598	303599	303599	I	5148	“ Just a tad . ”
303691	303706	303707	303707	I	5148	“ I ’m still trying to decide if I should thank you for this , ”
303710	303723	303707	303707	I	5148	“ Or if I should figure out a way to get revenge . ”
303724	303739	303740	303740	he	5148	“ While I ’m very intrigued by the possibility of being at your mercy , ”
303743	303757	303758	303758	He	5148	“ we both know that you ’re as turned on as I am . ”
303787	303791	303792	303792	I	5148	“ I am , ”
303862	303872	303873	303873	I	5148	“ I ’m hot and horny and desperately wet , ”
303902	303946	303892	303892	I	5148	“ Do you know what I wanted in the limo , Damien ? I wanted you on your knees in front of me . I wanted your hands on my thighs spreading me wide , and I wanted your tongue on my clit . ”
303966	304010	303947	303947	He	5148	“ I wanted to feel my nipples tighten when you tugged on this chain , and my body tense around this plug when you made me come , so hard and so fast that you ’d have to carry me into this club . ”
304011	304015	304016	304016	he	5148	“ Holy fuck , ”
304029	304033	304034	304034	I	5148	“ So yes , ”
304046	304052	304034	304034	I	5148	“ I am turned on . ”
304076	304098	304067	304067	I	5148	“ But what I wanted I did n’t get . And that , Mr. Stark , is why I want revenge . ”
304099	304110	304122	304122	He	5148	“ You make a very sound argument , Ms. Fairchild . ”
304111	304121	304067	304067	I	5148	“ I pride myself on my sharp business skills . ”
304139	304144	304122	304122	He	5148	“ Come with me . ”
304145	304151	304161	304161	He	5148	“ Where are we going ? ”
304152	304160	304122	304122	He	5148	“ Come with me and find out . ”
304601	304604	304605	304605	he	5148	“ No , ”
304658	304664	304642	304642	I	5148	“ Trouble , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
304712	304719	304720	304720	I	5148	“ No trouble , Mr. Stark , ”
304736	304741	304720	304720	I	5148	“ Christ , Nikki … ”
304850	304853	304854	304854	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
304857	304862	304854	304854	I	5148	“ Someone might see . ”
304863	304881	304854	304854	I	5148	“ I want you . Right now . I want to watch you explode in my arms . ”
304882	304885	304886	304886	I	5148	“ But — ”
304956	304959	304960	304960	he	5148	“ Now , ”
304963	304972	304960	304960	he	5148	“ I want you coming in my arms . ”
304973	304976	304977	304977	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
305152	305155	305156	305156	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
305176	305187	305156	305156	I	5148	“ Oh , God , Damien , please , yes . ”
305188	305192	305193	305193	he	5148	“ Good girl , ”
305320	305325	305326	305326	I	5148	“ Oh , God ! ”
305517	305522	305508	305508	I	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
305523	305532	305488	305488	I	5148	“ Baby , you can bite me anytime . ”
305533	305538	305539	305539	I	5148	“ Oh my God , ”
305542	305547	305539	305539	I	5148	“ Oh my God . ”
305551	305561	305539	305539	I	5148	“ You did n’t tell me it did that . ”
305579	305589	305562	305562	He	5148	“ A man has to keep a few surprises . ”
305615	305618	305619	305619	I	5148	“ Wow , ”
305622	305629	305619	305619	I	5148	“ That was kind of kinky . ”
305639	305645	305630	305630	His	5148	“ And is kinky good ? ”
305646	305649	305650	305650	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
305653	305659	305650	305650	I	5148	“ Kinky is very good . ”
305701	305706	305700	305700	his	5148	words—“Your ass is vibrating . ”
305712	305728	305707	305707	I	5148	“ Is that a euphemism for what you just did to me , Mr. Stark ? ”
305729	305732	305760	305760	Shit	402	“ Complaining ? ”
305733	305738	305739	305739	I	5148	“ Hell , no , ”
305742	305759	305760	305760	Shit	402	“ Good . But no , it ’s not a euphemism . It ’s your phone . ”
305840	305849	305850	305850	I	5148	“ Must have kicked over to voice mail , ”
305910	305915	305916	305916	I	5148	“ That reminds me , ”
305920	305963	305916	305916	I	5148	“ You got a call earlier . Right before I went to see Maynard . I thought it might be one of the German attorneys , so I answered it , but there was no one there . Did they call back ? ”
305969	305974	305975	305975	he	5148	“ Probably not important , ”
306068	306073	306074	306074	I	5148	“ Who was it ? ”
306084	306099	306074	306074	I	5148	“ Does it have anything to do with the trial or with those pictures ? ”
306100	306103	306120	306120	his	5148	“ No . ”
306146	306155	306156	306156	I	5148	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”
306184	306189	306190	306190	He	5148	“ I do n’t . ”
306213	306222	306204	306204	he	5148	“ I promise you . It ’s nothing . ”
306338	306345	306333	306333	Damien	5148	“ Do n’t look so worried . ”
306352	306359	306360	306360	I	5148	“ I ca n’t help it , ”
306363	306390	306360	306360	I	5148	“ I may not be the jealous type , but if you ’re getting calls from old girlfriends looking to pull you back into their web … ”
306423	306436	306413	306413	him	5148	“ Getting the calls and taking the calls are two different things . ”
306437	306440	306441	306441	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
306484	306508	306509	306509	He	5148	“ I told you I used to fuck around . And I ’m sure some of those women want back in my life . ”
306528	306550	306509	306509	He	5148	“ I also told you I was n’t serious about any of them . There ’s only one woman I want . ”
306562	306568	306551	306551	I	5148	“ Do they know that ? ”
306569	306574	306575	306575	he	5148	“ I know it , ”
306578	306584	306575	306575	he	5148	“ And so do you . ”
306667	306674	306675	306675	I	5148	“ Do you want to dance ? ”
306678	306681	306682	306682	he	5148	“ No , ”
306694	306703	306682	306682	he	5148	“ I want to take you to bed . ”
306705	306715	306716	306716	I	5148	“ So you ’re really taking me to bed ? ”
306731	306738	306739	306739	he	5148	“ That ’s my current plan , ”
306742	306751	306739	306739	he	5148	“ Unless you want to file an objection ? ”
306752	306758	306759	306759	I	5148	“ An objection ? No . ”
306848	306859	306860	306860	My	5148	“ But perhaps I might file one tiny change order ? ”
306873	306876	306877	306877	His	5148	“ Nikki … ”
306891	306949	306877	306877	His	5148	“ What ? I mean , fair is fair . You ’ve never fingerfucked me in a club in Munich before tonight . And unless I ’m mistaken , I ’ve never gone down on you in a moving limo in Munich , either . That ’s one of those oversights I want to remedy right now . ”
307122	307128	307129	307129	he	5148	“ Dear God , Nikki , ”
307136	307146	307129	307129	he	5148	“ Sometimes you surprise the hell out of me . ”
307457	307462	307464	307464	I	5148	“ What are you — ”
307526	307529	307530	307530	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
307533	307537	307530	307530	I	5148	“ Holy shit . ”
307538	307542	307543	307543	His	5148	“ Hold still . ”
307551	307556	307557	307557	he	5148	“ Do n’t move , ”
307622	307625	307626	307626	Damien	5148	“ Naughty , ”
307643	307654	307629	307629	he	5148	“ Let ’s see what we can do about that . ”
307666	307672	307655	307655	I	5148	“ I ’ll be still . ”
307673	307677	307678	307678	he	5148	“ Too late , ”
307717	307725	307726	307726	he	5148	“ I think someone likes my toys , ”
307729	307741	307726	307726	he	5148	“ I ’ll have to think of more ways to play . ”
307742	307749	307750	307750	I	5148	“ Oh , God , yes , ”
307790	307796	307776	307776	he	5148	“ This should do nicely . ”
307809	307826	307797	307797	I	5148	“ You realize that if you mess up my shoes , you ’re in serious trouble . ”
307827	307835	307836	307836	He	5148	“ Even if it gets you off ? ”
307872	307881	307882	307882	I	5148	“ Some things are as sacred as sex , ”
307885	307890	307882	307882	I	5148	“ Shoes among them . ”
307894	307900	307891	307891	He	5148	“ Touché , Ms. Fairchild . ”
307925	307931	307891	307891	He	5148	“ I ’ll be gentle . ”
307970	307974	307963	307963	he	5148	“ One down . ”
307989	307992	307993	307993	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
308023	308036	308037	308037	I	5148	“ Now let ’s see what we can do about this one . ”
308083	308093	308094	308094	I	5148	“ First aid ? What exactly are you doing ? ”
308125	308129	308111	308111	he	5148	“ Surprising you . ”
308185	308198	308211	308211	he	5148	“ Lay back , baby . Lay back , and trust me . ”
308288	308291	308292	308292	My	5148	“ Damien . ”
308301	308306	308292	308292	My	5148	“ Damien , please . ”
308307	308315	308292	308292	My	5148	“ Please what ? Please touch you ? ”
308334	308337	308338	308338	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
308341	308360	308338	308338	I	5148	“ God , yes . Touch me . Fuck me . Please , Damien , I want you . ”
308377	308380	308381	308381	He	5148	“ Mmm . ”
308434	308446	308447	308447	he	5148	“ No . Arms above your head . There you go , ”
308693	308735	308684	308684	His	5148	“ So tell me , Nikki , can you imagine the touch of my fingertip upon the inside of your thigh ? The way your body would tighten in response to a touch that is neither a caress nor a tickle ? ”
308736	308741	308684	308684	His	5148	“ I — yes . ”
308766	308804	308762	308762	He	5148	“ A sensual dance , like the brush of a feather over your panties . A hooked fingertip to tug them aside . And then what , Nikki ? What kind of touch do you want then ? ”
308870	308875	308853	308853	his	5148	“ Damien , what — ”
308931	308947	308976	308976	He	5148	“ Do you want it , Nikki ? Do you want me to fuck you ? ”
308948	308955	308956	308956	I	5148	“ You know that I do . ”
308981	308986	308987	308987	he	5148	“ What was that ? ”
308997	309000	309001	309001	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
309004	309009	309001	309001	I	5148	“ Please , sir . ”
309076	309087	309062	309062	I	5148	“ Please , Damien . Please , please fuck me . ”
309088	309117	309122	309122	He	5148	“ Believe me , Ms. Fairchild , there ’s nothing I ’m looking forward to more . But no . I do n’t think so . Not yet . ”
309131	309152	309122	309122	He	5148	“ What if I told you to touch yourself ? Ah , but you ca n’t do that , either . ”
309308	309313	309314	309314	he	5148	“ Oh , baby , ”
309317	309369	309314	309314	he	5148	“ I love how hot you get , how your body responds . Do you know what it does to me , knowing that you ’ve given yourself over so fully to me ? No barriers , no inhibitions . Just mine . To touch , to tempt , to tease . ”
309370	309378	309379	309379	My	5148	“ Anything you want , Mr. Stark . ”
309386	309391	309379	309379	My	5148	“ Anything you need . ”
309392	309401	309402	309402	he	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear it , ”
309435	309516	309402	309402	he	5148	“ Right now , I just want to look at you . The flush on your skin . Your cunt , swollen and wet and begging for me . Your hard nipples and the rise and fall of your chest as you try to control your breathing . It makes me hard , Nikki , so goddamn hard to see you like this , laid out and wanting , and knowing that I am the one who brought you there . ”
309647	309650	309651	309651	he	5148	“ Open , ”
309870	309882	309907	309907	he	5148	“ Oh , God . Damien , what are you doing ? ”
309883	309906	309907	309907	he	5148	“ Unless I ’m doing it wrong , I ’m getting you very , very worked up . And , my dear , ”
309925	309932	309911	309911	he	5148	“ I think I ’ve succeeded . ”
309946	309953	309954	309954	he	5148	“ Once more around the block , ”
309957	309967	309954	309954	he	5148	“ Then you can take us to the hotel . ”
309994	310000	310001	310001	I	5148	“ Are you punishing me ? ”
310004	310016	310001	310001	I	5148	“ Because right now , I ’m really not above begging . ”
310020	310031	310017	310017	He	5148	“ Punishing you ? I was simply following your lead . ”
310032	310036	310037	310037	I	5148	“ My lead ? ”
310055	310097	310049	310049	His	5148	“ You said you ’d never gone down on me in a moving limo in Munich . I assumed you ’d never been tied down half - naked in a limo . In Munich or elsewhere . Or was I mistaken ? ”
310098	310102	310103	310103	I	5148	“ Not mistaken , ”
310106	310121	310122	310122	I	5148	“ And I ’ve never been fucked in a limo in Munich , either , ”
310128	310137	310122	310122	I	5148	“ But you seem to have overlooked that . ”
310138	310144	310049	310049	His	5148	“ Complaining , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
310145	310152	310122	310122	I	5148	“ Hell yes , Mr. Stark . ”
310153	310167	310168	310168	His	5148	“ You know , I ’m tempted to keep you like this forever . ”
310212	310235	310198	310198	I	5148	“ We could tour Europe by car , you splayed out in the back of a limo , open to my pleasure . ”
310236	310259	310260	310260	I	5148	“ Or we could go back to the hotel this very second , and you could have your wicked way with me . ”
310268	310275	310260	310260	I	5148	“ Your call , Mr. Stark , ”
310284	310297	310276	310276	I	5148	“ But at the very least , you have to untie me . ”
310569	310572	310573	310573	Damien	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
310586	310591	310573	310573	Damien	5148	“ What is it ? ”
310659	310673	310674	310674	His	5148	“ Is this the first time you ’ve received a text like this ? ”
310685	310688	310689	310689	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
310794	310799	310800	310800	I	5148	“ Just delete it , ”
310804	310812	310800	310800	I	5148	“ Just make it fucking go away . ”
310813	310823	310860	310860	he	5148	“ No . We ’re going to trace it . ”
310824	310827	310828	310828	I	5148	“ Later , ”
310831	310851	310828	310828	I	5148	“ Please , Damien . Leave it for later . I do n’t want to think about it now . ”
310880	310893	310860	310860	he	5148	“ Trust me , sweetheart , you wo n’t need it tonight . ”
310917	310926	310904	310904	he	5148	“ Now it ’s just you and me . ”
310927	310934	310935	310935	I	5148	“ Just how I like it , ”
311386	311393	311394	311394	Damien	5148	“ What are you doing here ? ”
311415	311425	311426	311426	She	249	“ Damie , darling , do n’t be angry . ”
311465	311475	311476	311476	Damien	5148	“ How the hell did you get in here ? ”
311489	311521	311484	311484	she	249	“ After all the times I ’ve shared this room with you , I ’m like family . I just asked one of the room service boys to let me in . ”
311522	311538	311484	311484	she	249	“ It did n’t occur to you that you were costing the boy his job ? ”
311542	311580	311539	311539	She	249	“ Why would it ? I thought we could celebrate your victory together . And when have you ever kicked me out of your room , Damie ? When have you not been happy to see me ? ”
311581	311584	311585	311585	he	4042	“ Now , ”
311645	311649	311650	311650	I	5148	“ Get up , ”
311653	311664	311650	311650	I	5148	“ Get up and get the hell out of here . ”
311709	311718	311719	311719	she	249	“ You ’re Nichole , are n’t you ? ”
311738	311755	311731	311731	she	249	“ You ’re the little girl who caught his eye in Texas at that ridiculous pageant . ”
311756	311766	311767	311767	I	5148	“ I caught more than his eye , Carlotta , ”
311780	311815	311776	311776	Her	249	“ Are you sure ? Reality so rarely lives up to expectations . I hope you ’re prepared for the day he realizes that you are not the woman he wanted , after all . ”
311831	311859	311816	311816	I	5148	“ Sugar , I think you have us confused . I ’m the one he ’s taking to bed . It ’s you he does n’t want . ”
311873	311882	311816	311816	I	5148	“ Now get the hell out of here . ”
311913	311919	311920	311920	he	5148	“ You heard the lady , ”
311923	311926	311920	311920	he	5148	“ Go . ”
312044	312049	312038	312038	he	5148	“ Nikki , I — ”
312050	312063	312038	312038	he	5148	“ You what ? You did n’t know she would be here ? ”
312064	312071	312072	312072	His	5148	“ You know I did n’t . ”
312079	312105	312106	312106	I	5148	“ Do you think I ’m going to be jealous , knowing that there was a time when she had free run of this suite ? ”
312139	312152	312132	312132	I	5148	“ Just how many hotels around Europe is she intimately familiar with ? ”
312153	312158	312167	312167	He	5148	“ Goddammit , Nikki . ”
312159	312166	312132	312132	I	5148	“ One ? Three ? Five ? ”
312202	312217	312167	312167	He	5148	“ Did you take her here ? Like this ? Hard against a wall ? ”
312218	312226	312230	312230	his	5148	“ What the fuck are you doing ? ”
312244	312253	312230	312230	his	5148	“ What do you think I ’m doing ? ”
312254	312259	312260	312260	he	5148	“ Pissing me off , ”
312363	312376	312352	312352	I	5148	“ You ’re the only woman in my life now , Nikki . ”
312388	312399	312377	312377	I	5148	“ Do n’t you think I know that , too ? ”
312415	312425	312426	312426	I	5148	“ Unless I find you in bed with one , ”
312429	312468	312426	312426	I	5148	“ do n’t you even think of apologizing for another woman . Believe it or not , Damien Stark , I was not under the impression that you ’d taken a vow of chastity before sleeping with me . ”
312486	312489	312490	312490	My	5148	“ What ? ”
312495	312516	312469	312469	He	5148	“ I think , my very dear Ms. Fairchild , that you are in for a much - deserved punishment . ”
312517	312520	312521	312521	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
312560	312576	312545	312545	I	5148	“ Why ? Because I pushed your buttons ? That does n’t seem quite fair . ”
312577	312580	312581	312581	he	5148	“ No , ”
312584	312595	312581	312581	he	5148	“ it does n’t . And not because of that . ”
312596	312600	312545	312545	I	5148	“ What then ? ”
312601	312624	312581	312581	he	5148	“ Do you really think it ’s in the realm of possibility that you would ever find another woman in our bed ? ”
312625	312628	312629	312629	I	5148	“ No , ”
312632	312639	312629	312629	I	5148	“ Well , there you go . ”
312648	312663	312640	312640	I	5148	“ But you know I do n’t believe it and did n’t mean it . ”
312664	312668	312669	312669	he	5148	“ I do , ”
312672	312701	312669	312669	he	5148	“ But I ’ll tell you a little secret . It ’s the best excuse I have for bending you over and feeling the sting on my palm . ”
312743	312750	312730	312730	I	5148	“ Is that something you want ? ”
312767	312771	312772	312772	Damien	5148	“ Right now , ”
312775	312783	312772	312772	Damien	5148	“ I want it more than anything . ”
312813	312816	312784	312784	He	5148	“ Why ? ”
312817	312831	312798	312798	I	5148	“ You know me better than anyone , Nikki . You know why . ”
313085	313091	313092	313092	His	5148	“ Take off your skirt . ”
313097	313100	313101	313101	He	5148	“ I — ”
313164	313168	313169	313169	he	5148	“ Your skirt , ”
313178	313183	313184	313184	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
313239	313245	313246	313246	Damien	5148	“ Step out of it , ”
313252	313266	313249	313249	I	5148	“ Now the top . Pull it off . Toss it over there . ”
313380	313388	313375	313375	he	5148	“ No . I ’ll do that . ”
313623	313629	313630	313630	he	5148	“ Keep your eyes closed , ”
313652	313657	313633	313633	Satin	577	“ What are you — ”
313658	313661	313662	313662	he	5148	“ Hush , ”
313709	313712	313713	313713	I	5148	“ Clever , ”
313716	313719	313720	313720	he	5148	“ Enticing , ”
313723	313732	313720	313720	he	5148	“ Can I trust you not to peek ? ”
313733	313736	313737	313737	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
313740	313743	313753	313753	he	5148	“ Mmm . ”
313878	313881	313866	313866	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
313887	313893	313866	313866	I	5148	“ Mr. Stark ? Sir ? ”
313962	313972	313975	313975	his	5148	“ And here I thought you had more patience . ”
313984	314008	313975	313975	his	5148	“ And here I thought you were going to fuck me . At the very least , you were going to spank me . ”
314063	314069	314099	314099	he	5148	“ Frustrated , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
314070	314079	314080	314080	I	5148	“ Maybe I ’m feeling a little cheated , ”
314083	314098	314099	314099	he	5148	“ I promise you wo n’t by the time I ’m through with you , ”
314128	314163	314099	314099	he	5148	“ I did n’t get to take you as far as I would have liked during our limo ride . I intend to remedy that now . Slowly , and very , very thoroughly . ”
314186	314192	314193	314193	he	5148	“ Your eyes are open , ”
314196	314199	314200	314200	I	5148	“ Ah . ”
314213	314217	314218	314218	he	5148	“ Close them , ”
314259	314262	314263	314263	he	5148	“ Nice , ”
314272	314307	314263	314263	he	5148	“ Now everything you hear , everything you feel , every bit of pleasure , every hint of pain will come from me . So tell me , Nikki . Does that excite you ? ”
314308	314314	314336	314336	I	5148	“ You know it does . ”
314332	314335	314322	314322	his	5148	“ Why ? ”
314347	314382	314336	314336	I	5148	“ Because — because you know me . Because you know what I can take . You know what I want . You know my limits , Damien . And because you push them . ”
314383	314387	314336	314336	I	5148	“ Good girl . ”
314519	314522	314523	314523	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
314601	314610	314611	314611	he	5148	“ Should I crush these as Cleopatra did ? ”
314614	314622	314623	314623	I	5148	“ I do n’t need an aphrodisiac , ”
314630	314681	314623	314623	I	5148	“ No , I do n’t think you do . I can see the flush on your skin , I can breathe in the scent of your arousal . When I touch you , I know I will find you desperately wet for me . Wo n’t I , Nikki ? ”
314682	314689	314711	314711	I	5148	“ Oh , God , yes . ”
314690	314693	314694	314694	I	5148	“ Good . ”
314702	314710	314694	314694	I	5148	“ Now spread your legs for me . ”
314788	314791	314792	314792	Damien	5148	“ Shhh , ”
314829	314832	314833	314833	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
314930	314936	314959	314959	he	5148	“ Damien ! What the — ”
314944	314947	314948	314948	he	5148	“ Quiet , ”
314951	314956	314948	314948	he	5148	“ And stay still . ”
314998	315001	315008	315008	him	5148	“ Damien ? ”
315260	315271	315272	315272	he	5148	“ Do you have any idea how beautiful you look ? ”
315275	315294	315272	315272	he	5148	“ Your skin flush . Your nipples hard . Your lips parted as if waiting for my kiss . ”
315295	315300	315301	315301	I	5148	“ I am waiting , ”
315365	315369	315370	315370	he	5148	“ Turn around , ”
315373	315377	315378	315378	I	5148	“ Um … ? ”
315392	315399	315400	315400	he	5148	“ Cross your wrists and turn , ”
315435	315449	315450	315450	he	5148	“ Good girl . Now slide down a bit . That ’s it , ”
315520	315523	315524	315524	he	5148	“ Beautiful , ”
315583	315598	315599	315599	he	5148	“ Soon . I have something else in mind , first . Your legs , ”
315610	315615	315599	315599	he	5148	“ A bit wider . ”
315642	315658	315659	315659	Damien	5148	“ It ’s interesting how many things one can find in a kitchen that entice , ”
315666	315676	315659	315659	Damien	5148	“ This , for example , seems quite intriguing . ”
315712	315719	315720	315720	Damien	5148	“ A simple wooden kitchen spoon , ”
315728	315737	315720	315720	Damien	5148	“ Who knew it could be so tantalizing ? ”
315854	315861	315862	315862	he	5148	“ That ’s it , baby , ”
315865	315877	315862	315862	he	5148	“ You ’re glowing , but your ass is on fire . ”
316069	316078	316094	316094	I	5148	“ Oh , yes , baby . Yes — ”
316410	316413	316443	316443	he	5148	“ Damien . ”
316425	316428	316429	316429	He	5148	“ Shhhh . ”
316456	316463	316464	316464	I	5148	“ I want to see you , ”
316478	316486	316487	316487	he	5148	“ You see me better than anyone , ”
316534	316541	316542	316542	I	5148	“ I think I ’m destroyed , ”
316548	316560	316542	316542	I	5148	“ I do n’t know that I can ever move again . ”
316561	316569	316570	316570	He	5148	“ No ? That ’s too bad . ”
316639	316644	316645	316645	he	5148	“ Destroyed or not , ”
316648	316656	316645	316645	he	5148	“ I have to have you again . ”
316657	316661	316662	316662	I	5148	“ Take me , ”
316736	316740	316719	316719	I	5148	“ Turn over , ”
316749	316758	316719	316719	I	5148	“ I want to see you under me . ”
316917	316922	316923	316923	Damien	5148	“ What is it ? ”
316973	316977	316978	316978	I	5148	“ Stupid stuff , ”
316981	316993	316978	316978	I	5148	“ I was thinking about what Carmela said . About reality . ”
316994	317018	316963	316963	he	5148	“ Carmela ’s a cold bitch . And the only reality I know is you . Do n’t tell me you doubt that . ”
317019	317024	317025	317025	I	5148	“ I do n’t , ”
317029	317090	317025	317025	I	5148	“ But , Damien , all the noise outside of us . I do n’t want to feel like we ’re living in a fantasy bubble , but sometimes I think that we are , and that reality keeps trying to break through . The trial . Stalker mail and texts . The press . And now your old girlfriends . ”
317091	317095	317096	317096	he	5148	“ Fuck them , ”
317099	317106	317025	317025	I	5148	“ Damien , I ’m serious . ”
317107	317112	317113	317113	he	5148	“ So am I , ”
317127	317159	317113	317113	he	5148	“ At the end of the day , it ’s just you and me . We make our own reality , Nikki . And no one can take it from us . ”
317197	317207	317208	317208	Damien	5148	“ I keep that room on a permanent lease , ”
317211	317226	317208	317208	Damien	5148	“ If you left something behind , the hotel will ship it to us . ”
317227	317233	317234	317234	I	5148	“ You own the room ? ”
317278	317292	317293	317293	He	5148	“ Enough clients visit the Stark International office here to justify the expense . ”
317334	317353	317293	317293	He	5148	“ If the maids find anything , the concierge will call our corporate liaison . Do n’t worry . ”
317379	317383	317384	317384	I	5148	“ My phone , ”
317387	317395	317384	317384	I	5148	“ We do need to go back . ”
317419	317425	317426	317426	Damien	5148	“ I still have it , ”
317444	317447	317448	317448	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
317475	317483	317466	317466	I	5148	“ Were you able to learn anything ? ”
317484	317519	317466	317466	I	5148	“ Not yet . I forwarded it to my team . Hopefully they ’ll have news by the time we arrive back in the States . In the meantime , do n’t delete it . ”
317520	317523	317524	317524	I	5148	“ Okay , ”
317717	317730	317731	317731	Evelyn	5962	“ And feel free to plant a kiss on him from me , ”
317873	317875	317872	317879	the “ friend ” side of the equation	4092	“ friend ”
317893	317897	317898	317898	Damien	5148	“ Good news ? ”
317901	317909	317910	317910	I	5148	“ Maybe . It ’s from Lisa . ”
318060	318065	318045	318045	she	651	“ Well , shit , ”
318087	318093	318094	318094	Damien	5148	“ Talk with him later , ”
318108	318117	318098	318098	I	5148	“ You ’ll want to cool down first . ”
318204	318207	318208	318208	he	837	“ Nikki , ”
318217	318223	318208	318208	he	837	“ You heading out today ? ”
318224	318228	318229	318229	I	5148	“ We are , ”
318256	318259	318260	318260	He	837	“ Right . ”
318268	318279	318260	318260	He	837	“ So I ’ll see you on the flip side ? ”
318280	318283	318284	318284	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
318287	318293	318284	318284	I	5148	“ We ’ll do drinks . ”
318294	318302	318260	318260	He	837	“ Hell , yeah , we will . ”
318440	318456	318433	318433	he	5148	“ Congrats again , man . I ’m really happy it worked out for you . ”
318457	318462	318463	318463	Damien	5148	“ I appreciate it , ”
318466	318476	318463	318463	Damien	5148	“ And thank you for all your hard work . ”
318543	318550	318531	318531	We	4109	“ Maybe I was imagining it ? ”
318636	318641	318642	318642	Damien	5148	“ You were n’t , ”
318645	318685	318642	318642	Damien	5148	“ and it ’s going to bite him in the ass . Maybe not because of this girl , but because he ’s living in a fantasy world , and eventually reality is going to catch up to him . ”
318686	318690	318691	318691	I	5148	“ I know , ”
318694	318704	318691	318691	I	5148	“ Ollie ’s always been a master of denial . ”
318868	318891	318860	318860	he	5148	“ Different realities , Nikki . You and I are together , and we can withstand whatever the world throws at us . ”
318959	318990	318935	318935	Damien	5148	“ Ollie has the chance to have what we have . To be part of something special . But he ’s scared and now he ’s sabotaging his own happiness . ”
319017	319023	319024	319024	he	5148	“ I ’m not scared , ”
319027	319037	319024	319024	he	5148	“ Not about that . And neither are you . ”
319069	319077	319078	319078	Damien	5148	“ What did Lisa have to say ? ”
319139	319165	319122	319124	a business consultant	510	“ She says one of her clients is moving to Boston and wants to sublet a space in Sherman Oaks at a pretty steep discount . ”
319166	319172	319173	319173	Damien	5148	“ That ’s excellent news , ”
319176	319179	319180	319180	I	5148	“ Maybe , ”
319183	319193	319180	319180	I	5148	“ I ’m still not sure I need it . ”
319299	319335	319286	319286	his	5148	“ At the very least , you should meet with her and talk about the possibility . She ’s sharp and has a good reputation and a solid client base . She can help you . ”
319529	319534	319535	319535	he	5148	“ You did good , ”
319538	319559	319535	319535	he	5148	“ I ’ll even take you out to lunch to celebrate . How do you feel about fish and chips ? ”
319560	319565	319526	319526	Damien	5148	“ Fish and chips ? ”
319566	319576	319535	319535	he	5148	“ I need to make a stop in London . ”
319577	319583	319526	319526	Damien	5148	“ All right . Sofia ? ”
319584	319589	319535	319535	he	5148	“ Do you mind ? ”
319590	319595	319596	319596	I	5148	“ Of course not . ”
319685	319690	319691	319691	I	5148	“ Is she okay ? ”
319694	319700	319701	319701	he	5148	“ I do n’t know , ”
319712	319718	319719	319719	He	5148	“ She ’s missing again . ”
319736	319741	319742	319742	I	5148	“ Whatever you need , ”
319745	319750	319742	319742	I	5148	“ Anytime , anyplace . ”
320170	320182	320183	320183	he	5148	“ Let me know the moment you get through to Alaine , ”
320235	320253	320220	320220	He	5148	“ And since I ’m in town anyway , bring me the projections on the Newton project . ”
320254	320261	320262	320262	She	914	“ Of course , Mr. Stark . ”
320272	320296	320262	320262	She	914	“ It was a pleasure to meet you , Ms. Fairchild . I ’m sorry the circumstances could n’t have been more pleasant . ”
320297	320306	320307	320307	I	5148	“ A pleasure to meet you , too , ”
320330	320334	320323	320323	I	5148	“ Any luck ? ”
320335	320364	320262	320262	She	914	“ Unfortunately , no . She checked herself out of the most recent rehab facility about a week ago , and no one ’s heard from her since . ”
320365	320372	320323	320323	I	5148	“ Oh . I ’m sorry . ”
320376	320416	320373	320373	He	5148	“ It ’s not the first time , but usually she turns up after a few days back in her apartment in St. Albans , drunk or stoned off her ass and ready to go get dried out again . ”
320417	320423	320262	320262	She	914	“ How old is she ? ”
320424	320435	320373	320373	He	5148	“ Twenty - nine . A year younger than me . ”
320443	320462	320436	320436	I	5148	“ And she ’s in rehab voluntarily ? I mean , a judge did n’t put her there ? ”
320463	320475	320476	320476	he	5148	“ Sometimes I think it would be easier if one did , ”
320480	320488	320476	320476	he	5148	“ But no , it ’s voluntary . ”
320489	320493	320494	320494	I	5148	“ I see , ”
320555	320567	320568	320568	I	5148	“ I get that you ’re worried something happened to her , ”
320571	320631	320568	320568	I	5148	“ What I do n’t understand is why . She ’s an adult and she checked out legitimately . Maybe she just decided to travel . To go hang with some other friends . They said she was almost dried out , right ? Maybe she wants to prove to herself that she can operate sober on her own . ”
320667	320675	320676	320676	Damien	5148	“ She may have done just that , ”
320679	320694	320676	320676	Damien	5148	“ But if you suddenly could n’t find Jamie , what would you do ? ”
320716	320723	320704	320704	he	5148	“ Point taken , Mr. Stark . ”
320724	320732	320733	320733	he	5148	“ There ’s another reason , too , ”
320827	320857	320824	320824	he	5148	“ She and I had an agreement . I ’d foot the bill , and she ’d finish the treatments . I do n’t like having my conditions ignored . ”
320905	320930	320892	320892	he	5148	“ Why are you paying for the treatment ? And not just this one round . There ’ve been others , too , right ? ”
320985	321006	320980	320980	I	5148	“ I ’ve been paying Sofia ’s way for as long as I ’ve had the money to do so . ”
321012	321013	321007	321007	My	5148	“ Why?”—and
321162	321169	321170	321170	Damien	5148	“ She was Richter ’s daughter , ”
321173	321183	321170	321170	Damien	5148	“ And he did n’t leave her a dime . ”
321197	321214	321193	321193	he	5148	“ Sofia is Richter ’s daughter , but he left all of his money to you ? ”
321215	321219	321220	321220	Damien	5148	“ He did , ”
321223	321246	321193	321193	he	5148	“ So that ’s why you take care of her ? Why did n’t you just sign the money over to her ? ”
321247	321254	321255	321255	he	5148	“ That was n’t an option , ”
321258	321364	321255	321255	he	5148	“ For one thing , she had issues even back then . She ’s brilliant but impulsive , and she does n’t make the best choices . So I set up a trust . She can access money for her needs . I bought an apartment for her . I pay for her treatment . The bottom line is that she has a life and property because I did n’t give her that money . If I had , she probably would have died from an overdose . At the very least , she would have either drunk , injected , or snorted it away . ”
321373	321392	321403	321403	he	4167	“ But the truth is that I would have helped her even if there had been no inheritance . ”
321409	321426	321403	321403	he	4167	“ She knew about what he did to me . Her friendship helped keep me sane . ”
321427	321432	321433	321433	I	5148	“ Oh , God . ”
321473	321485	321459	321459	he	4167	“ She knew what kind of a monster her father was . ”
321486	321490	321491	321491	he	4167	“ She did , ”
321494	321526	321491	321491	he	4167	“ And we survived him together . In the end , I was better suited at survival than she was . But dammit , Nikki , she was there for me . ”
321537	321542	321527	321527	I	5148	“ Alaine , too ? ”
321548	321571	321543	321543	Damien	5148	“ He did n’t know anything . I value his friendship , of course . But my relationship with Sofia runs deeper . ”
321643	321649	321650	321650	I	5148	“ You ’ll find her , ”
321653	321664	321650	321650	I	5148	“ When have you ever not gotten something you want ? ”
321690	321700	321701	321701	I	5148	“ The trial must have been hell for her , ”
321704	321710	321711	321711	I	5148	“ Her father . You . ”
321726	321778	321793	321794	Ms. Ives	579	“ We did n’t talk about it . She did n’t like to think about the fact that Merle Richter was her father . I spoke to her a few hours before you arrived in Germany , actually . I kept expecting her to bring it up . She never did . ”
321863	321866	321867	321867	he	837	“ Damien , ”
321870	321881	321867	321867	he	837	“ I was so pleased to hear about the dismissal . ”
321882	321890	321867	321867	he	837	“ Thank you . You remember Nikki ? ”
321891	321922	321867	321867	he	837	“ Of course . It is a pleasure to see you again , Nikki . Hopefully next time it will be in person with a glass of my best wine . ”
321923	321929	321867	321867	he	837	“ I ’d like that . ”
321985	322006	322014	322014	Damien	5148	“ I ’m sorry I was n’t available when you called earlier . Your message said it was about Sofia ? ”
322007	322013	322014	322014	Damien	5148	“ She ’s gone again , ”
322017	322047	322014	322014	Damien	5148	“ Checked herself out a few days ago and took off . I have n’t been able to find her , and I thought she might have called you . ”
322048	322057	322058	322058	he	5148	“ You are in luck , my friend , ”
322061	322069	322058	322058	he	5148	“ I know exactly where she is . ”
322082	322085	322070	322070	I	5148	“ Where ? ”
322086	322089	322014	322014	Damien	5148	“ Shanghai . ”
322090	322093	322070	322070	I	5148	“ Shanghai ? ”
322099	322109	322070	322070	I	5148	“ Why ? When did you talk to her ? ”
322115	322174	322110	322110	Alaine	837	“ Three — no , four days ago . Do you remember David , that drummer she was intrigued with a few years back ? Apparently his band is booked for a week in a club there . She said she might be in Chicago , too , if a job the band is hoping for comes through . ”
322274	322279	322280	322280	Damien	5148	“ She called you ? ”
322284	322304	322280	322280	Damien	5148	“ I ’ve been trying to reach her by cell , but it just rolls over to voice mail . ”
322305	322312	322313	322313	he	5148	“ It was a video call , ”
322316	322363	322313	322313	he	5148	“ I asked if she ’d talked to you , but she did n’t want to bother you during the trial . I ’m surprised she has n’t called you now that it ’s over , but knowing Sofia , she has n’t seen the news . ”
322364	322376	322280	322280	Damien	5148	“ Can you conference her in through the account she used ? ”
322398	322406	322407	322407	Alaine	837	“ I think so . Hang on . ”
322536	322544	322545	322545	Alaine	837	“ I think this will do it , ”
322553	322560	322545	322545	Alaine	837	“ Well , damn the girl . ”
322589	322594	322595	322595	I	5148	“ What is that ? ”
322598	322605	322606	322606	Damien	5148	“ She ’s closed her account , ”
322609	322618	322606	322606	Damien	5148	“ You do n’t have another contact number ? ”
322619	322628	322629	322629	Alaine	837	“ Other than her cell phone ? No . ”
322639	322672	322629	322629	Alaine	837	“ I swear I do n’t know what she ’s thinking half the time . But she said she ’d call after Shanghai and let me know where they ’re going next . ”
322673	322692	322606	322606	Damien	5148	“ Tell her to call me , too . For that matter , hook me into the call . ”
322693	322725	322629	322629	Alaine	837	“ Will do . And , Damien , do n’t worry . She will turn up . She always does . And we both know that she is a mercurial soul . ”
322726	322733	322734	322734	Damien	5148	“ She ’s a disturbed soul , ”
322737	322743	322744	322744	Alaine	837	“ Are n’t we all ? ”
322838	322843	322831	322831	Damien	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
322844	322847	322848	322848	he	5148	“ Frustrated , ”
322851	322857	322848	322848	he	5148	“ But I ’m fine . ”
322882	322886	322887	322887	he	5148	“ Thank you , ”
322890	322894	322887	322887	he	5148	“ For what ? ”
322895	322899	322869	322869	he	5148	“ For everything . ”
322911	322917	322900	322900	My	5148	“ Anytime , Mr. Stark . ”
322918	322928	322929	322929	he	5148	“ I think I ’m done here for now , ”
322932	322970	322929	322929	he	5148	“ You ’ve never been to London , have you ? Do you want to stay the night ? We could go to Harrods . Catch a show in the West End . See a few sights . ”
322971	322974	322975	322975	I	5148	“ No , ”
322978	322994	322975	322975	I	5148	“ I just want to be with you . I just want to go home . ”
322995	323007	323008	323008	Damien	5148	“ And that ’s another reason that we are perfect together , ”
323011	323019	323008	323008	Damien	5148	“ I want exactly the same thing . ”
323021	323040	323008	323008	Damien	5148	“ Welcome aboard , Mr. Stark , Ms. Fairchild . Would you care for a glass of champagne ? ”
323041	323047	323048	323048	I	5148	“ Yes , thank you , ”
323158	323166	323167	323167	I	5148	“ What happened to the other plane ? ”
323205	323214	323215	323215	he	4180	“ This is the Lear Bombardier Global 8000 , ”
323218	323269	323270	323270	he	4180	“ We ’re crossing the Atlantic , remember ? Not to mention all of the United States . I thought traveling in a plane with sufficient fuel capacity made sense . Plus it ’s easier to get work done with an actual office . And sleep in an actual bed , ”
323285	323295	323270	323270	he	4180	“ This thing has an office and a bed ? ”
323296	323305	323306	323306	he	4180	“ There ’s a bed in the stateroom , ”
323309	323312	323313	323313	I	5148	“ Wow . ”
323381	323439	323370	323370	she	3145	“ Mr. Stark , you ’ve had a telephone call from Mr. Maynard . He tried to reach your cell , but apparently the call did n’t connect . When he realized you were on board , he called the tower and asked that we get a message to you to call him at your earliest convenience . ”
323440	323448	323463	323463	he	4185	“ Can we hold on the runway ? ”
323449	323454	323370	323370	she	3145	“ Yes , sir . ”
323455	323462	323463	323463	he	4185	“ I ’ll call him now , ”
323661	323665	323666	323666	I	5148	“ What happened ? ”
323669	323675	323676	323676	He	5148	“ Nothing to worry about . ”
323701	323718	323719	323719	He	5148	“ But I am worrying . Charles would n’t radio the tower unless it was important . ”
323737	323746	323728	323728	I	5148	“ You ’re right . He would n’t . ”
323747	323753	323719	323719	He	5148	“ Then what is it ? ”
323754	323776	323777	323777	His	5148	“ There ’ve been some time - sensitive developments on a couple of matters that I ’ve been chipping away at . ”
323799	323809	323719	323719	He	5148	“ Do n’t shut me out again , Damien . ”
323810	323815	323816	323816	he	5148	“ I ’m not , ”
323820	323827	323816	323816	he	5148	“ Not everything is about us . ”
323842	323846	323828	323828	I	5148	“ I see . ”
323855	323861	323847	323847	I	5148	“ Well , never mind . ”
323862	323865	323866	323866	His	5148	“ Nikki … ”
323889	323894	323895	323895	I	5148	“ It ’s fine , ”
324452	324458	324459	324459	I	5148	“ I ’m not hungry , ”
324462	324472	324459	324459	I	5148	“ I ’m going to sleep a little longer . ”
324571	324582	324583	324583	he	5148	“ You should have called me out for my bullshit , ”
324613	324621	324622	324622	he	5148	“ Of course it ’s about us , ”
324625	324649	324622	324622	he	5148	“ There ’s nothing in my life that is n’t about us . How could there be when my world revolves around you ? ”
324650	324654	324655	324655	I	5148	“ Do n’t , ”
324663	324676	324655	324655	I	5148	“ Do n’t shift the focus by plying me with romantic platitudes . ”
324704	324707	324708	324708	he	5148	“ Platitudes ? ”
324715	324734	324708	324708	he	5148	“ Jesus , Nikki , are you telling me you do n’t know what you mean to me ? ”
324753	324768	324735	324735	He	5148	“ Have n’t I told you every single day that we ’ve been together ? ”
324865	324869	324870	324870	I	5148	“ I know , ”
324873	324905	324870	324870	I	5148	“ But that does n’t make it relevant . Maynard did n’t call about stock prices or your corporate logo or what they serve in the goddamn lunchroom at Stark Tower . ”
324934	325031	325032	325032	He	5148	“ We ’re not attached at the hip , Damien . Everything ’s not about us . And that ’s fine . Hell , it ’s good . I do n’t want to steal your autonomy any more than I want to hand you mine . But I have memorized every line of your face , and I recognized the shadows I saw in your eyes . So do n’t trivialize something that really does affect us by making it sound like some minor irritation that ’s going to require us to reschedule dinner next Thursday . ”
325042	325045	325046	325046	he	5148	“ Well , ”
325167	325172	325173	325173	I	5148	“ I love you , ”
325186	325189	325190	325190	My	5148	“ Nikki . ”
325373	325393	325364	325364	he	5148	“ The press has been going hot and heavy suggesting that I bribed someone to get the charges dropped . ”
325407	325412	325394	325394	I	5148	“ Those fucking bastards . ”
325420	325439	325416	325416	his	5148	“ I agree completely with your assessment , but the truth is I ’ve been accused of worse . ”
325473	325476	325477	325477	I	5148	“ Okay , ”
325480	325484	325477	325477	I	5148	“ Go on . ”
325485	325522	325464	325464	That	525	“ Apparently the prosecutors and judges were n’t thrilled with the allegations . The prosecution released an official statement that the charges against me were dropped after additional evidence was brought to the court ’s attention . ”
325547	325558	325464	325464	That	525	“ Now the press is pushing to see the evidence . ”
325567	325573	325561	325561	I	5148	“ Damien , that ’s — ”
325664	325682	325656	325656	I	5148	“ Surely they wo n’t . The evidence is sealed , right ? What did Maynard say ? ”
325733	325770	325718	325719	the court	1742	“ Vogel is on it , and Charles is staying in Munich to work with him . He ’s optimistic , but it ’s too early for me to have any real sense of the outcome . ”
325771	325775	325776	325776	I	5148	“ I see . ”
325858	325866	325867	325867	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry I hurt you , ”
325901	325919	325887	325887	him	5148	“ Are n’t you the one who told me that pain and passion go hand in hand ? ”
326094	326100	326101	326101	he	5148	“ Do you like that ? ”
326104	326113	326101	326101	he	5148	“ Yes , oh , God , yes . ”
326240	326247	326248	326248	he	5148	“ Tell me what you need , ”
326251	326254	326255	326255	I	5148	“ You , ”
326258	326263	326255	326255	I	5148	“ I need you . ”
326264	326269	326270	326270	he	5148	“ Goddammit , Nikki , ”
326273	326287	326270	326270	he	5148	“ that ’s not what I mean . Tell me what you need . ”
326320	326325	326326	326326	I	5148	“ I need you , ”
326330	326362	326326	326326	I	5148	“ That ’s all I need . I was n’t going to do it , I swear . I thought about it , but I was n’t going to do it . ”
326363	326368	326369	326369	His	5148	“ Oh , baby . ”
326418	326423	326424	326424	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
326427	326440	326424	326424	he	5148	“ I brought you there , and I ’m so fucking sorry . ”
326441	326444	326445	326445	I	5148	“ No , ”
326448	326472	326473	326473	I	5148	“ It ’s me . Only me . And you ’re what keeps me strong . Oh , God , Damien , please , ”
326494	326504	326473	326473	I	5148	“ Now , please , I need you now . ”
326505	326508	326509	326509	My	5148	“ Nikki . ”
326536	326541	326526	326526	his	5148	“ Oh , baby . ”
326653	326656	326657	326657	he	5148	“ No , ”
326688	326691	326692	326692	I	5148	“ Hurry , ”
326786	326795	326775	326775	I	5148	“ Now , Damien , fuck me now . ”
326953	326960	326961	326961	he	5148	“ That ’s it , baby , ”
326979	327014	326961	326961	he	5148	“ I want to watch your face as you explode . I want to know that I ’ve taken you to the brink , and then I want to go over the edge with you .
327015	327019	327020	327020	he	5148	“ Come on , ”
327034	327044	327045	327045	he	5148	“ Come on , baby — oh , yes , ”
327140	327145	327146	327146	I	5148	“ Oh , God , ”
327261	327269	327270	327270	he	5148	“ Welcome to the Mile High Club , ”
327293	327309	327279	327279	I	5148	“ You are what I need , Damien . You ’re all that I need . ”
327365	327369	327361	327361	I	5148	“ I love you ”
327401	327421	327391	327391	Damien	5148	“ No matter what the German court decides , there ’s a good chance those pictures are going public . ”
327477	327484	327461	327461	I	5148	“ Why would you say that ? ”
327485	327494	327495	327495	he	5148	“ I think your earlier thought was right , ”
327498	327510	327495	327495	he	5148	“ I think my father might be the one behind this . ”
327511	327516	327517	327517	I	5148	“ Damien , no . ”
327528	327535	327517	327517	I	5148	“ Do you really think so ? ”
327536	327553	327558	327560	Damien ’s father	225	“ It makes sense . If I go to jail , his asset stream dries up . ”
327582	327613	327614	327614	He	225	“ Even if you ’re right , that only explains how the court got the photos . Why on earth would you think that he ’d make them go public ? ”
327631	327662	327623	327623	I	5148	“ Tabloids . Internet sites . So - called news programs . They ’ll all pay a lot for information if they think it will sell ad space or papers . ”
327663	327666	327667	327667	I	5148	“ Shit , ”
327683	327690	327667	327667	I	5148	“ Maybe it ’s not him . ”
327691	327695	327667	327667	I	5148	“ Maybe not . ”
327707	327713	327667	327667	I	5148	“ What will you do ? ”
327714	327722	327723	327723	he	225	“ I ’m still thinking about that , ”
327736	327745	327667	327667	I	5148	“ Will you tell me when you decide ? ”
327754	327757	327758	327758	he	225	“ Yes , ”
327761	327765	327758	327758	he	225	“ I promise . ”
327789	327798	327828	327828	he	225	“ How much longer before we get home ? ”
327821	327827	327828	327828	he	225	“ A few more hours , ”
327846	327858	327828	327828	he	225	“ But we ’re not going home . Not right away . ”
327859	327869	327828	327828	he	225	“ We ’re not ? Where are we going ? ”
327870	327877	327878	327878	he	225	“ One of my favorite places , ”
327888	327896	327878	327878	he	225	“ I think you ’ll like it . ”
328053	328058	328059	328059	he	225	“ You ’re grinning , ”
328062	328074	328075	328075	I	5148	“ I ’m picturing you in a loincloth holding an atlatl , ”
328078	328088	328075	328075	I	5148	“ Damien Stark , the leader of the tribe . ”
328089	328104	328105	328105	he	225	“ Please tell me this is n’t a retreat you ’re planning for us , ”
328108	328126	328105	328105	he	225	“ Not unless it involves you in a Raquel Welch – style fur miniskirt for a weekend . ”
328127	328136	328137	328137	I	5148	“ Even then you would n’t like it , ”
328140	328157	328137	328137	I	5148	“ I believe the women were in charge of the cooking back in the caveman days . ”
328158	328162	328163	328163	he	225	“ Good point , ”
328192	328204	328178	328178	We	4226	“ peel back plastic cover and set microwave for five minutes . ”
328205	328211	328212	328212	He	225	“ Are we getting close ? ”
328241	328247	328234	328234	he	225	“ Just around this bend . ”
328635	328640	328641	328641	He	5148	“ You own this ? ”
328654	328677	328641	328641	He	5148	“ I wanted a weekend getaway . Something I could drive to at the last minute . Something out of the way . ”
328678	328693	328641	328641	He	5148	“ Palm Springs not appealing ? Your Santa Barbara hotel too long a drive ? ”
328694	328706	328707	328707	he	5148	“ The condo in Palm Springs is on the golf course , ”
328710	328756	328757	328757	he	5148	“ and since I ’m not much of a golfer , I let my staff reserve time as a perk . As for Santa Barbara , it ’s an exceptional property , but sometimes a man just wants to be alone . Or not alone , ”
328773	328808	328767	328767	I	5148	“ You know those computer apps where you can put a little flag on a map for every town you ’ve lived in or where all your Facebook friends are from , or whatever ? ”
328809	328812	328757	328757	he	5148	“ Sure . ”
328813	328826	328767	328767	I	5148	“ We need to get one of those for all your properties . ”
328833	328867	328827	328827	His	5148	“ I ’ll get right on that . And then we can start working our way through them , one by one . Only a few of my properties have been properly christened . ”
328868	328886	328887	328887	I	5148	“ Is that so ? Well , then . Maybe we should start with your Arrowhead property , ”
328890	328897	328887	328887	I	5148	“ Maybe we should start tonight . ”
328898	328920	328921	328921	I	5148	“ I ca n’t think of a better way to spend the evening . Or the morning . Or the afternoon . ”
328933	328966	328921	328921	I	5148	“ This place is huge . I say we christen these rooms first and then we can move on to other locations . That will take us , what ? A year ? ”
328967	328974	328975	328975	he	5148	“ It ’s not that big , ”
328978	328985	328975	328975	he	5148	“ Only nine thousand square feet . ”
328986	328992	328993	328993	I	5148	“ Practically an efficiency apartment , ”
328998	329008	329009	329009	he	5148	“ Eleven thousand if you count the guest house , ”
329029	329057	329009	329009	he	5148	“ The caretaker and his wife live there . I told them this was a relaxing and informal week and to leave us to fend for ourselves . ”
329058	329068	328975	328975	he	5148	“ Sounds good . I ’m all about relaxing . ”
329069	329099	329100	329100	he	5148	“ The property has a pool , a hot tub , an outdoor grill , and access to some of the county - maintained hiking trails . It also , ”
329108	329129	329100	329100	he	5148	“ has a number of very comfortable beds . Depending on the kind of relaxing you ’d like to do . ”
329130	329137	329138	329138	I	5148	“ I ’m big on variety , ”
329141	329167	329138	329138	I	5148	“ A bed … a hot tub … so long as I ’m not relaxing by myself , I ’ll be a very happy girl . ”
329168	329177	329178	329178	He	5148	“ I do love the way you think . ”
329194	329205	329206	329206	he	5148	“ That ’s not the only reason we ’re here , ”
329210	329246	329206	329206	he	5148	“ I thought about what you said . About reality catching us off guard . And I thought that it might be good for both of us to ease slowly back into the real world . ”
329247	329257	329258	329258	I	5148	“ We can go as slow as you want , ”
329261	329271	329258	329258	I	5148	“ You wo n’t get any complaints from me . ”
329281	329308	329273	329273	I	5148	“ Except that I have to be back in LA by ten Friday morning . That ’s when Lisa is going to show me the sublet . ”
329309	329326	329206	329206	he	5148	“ Fair enough . Friday marks our return to reality . A sad , mournful day . ”
329327	329332	329333	329333	I	5148	“ Do n’t even , ”
329336	329365	329333	329333	I	5148	“ You ’re going to fire up that Bluetooth headset and start cooking up some deal before we even get through that door , and you know it . ”
329366	329371	329372	329372	he	5148	“ I wo n’t , ”
329382	329394	329372	329372	he	5148	“ I have plans for when we walk through that door . ”
329395	329406	329408	329408	I	5148	“ Do you ? I bet I can guess what . ”
329528	329534	329535	329535	I	5148	“ You did n’t know ? ”
329553	329559	329560	329560	Damien	5148	“ About Jamie , yes , ”
329572	329603	329560	329560	Damien	5148	“ I could n’t think of a better way to ease you back into reality than to bring Jamie out here . She ’s about as real as it gets . ”
329623	329635	329615	329615	Jamie	1450	“ But the decorations ? I did n’t have a clue . ”
329636	329641	329642	329642	Jamie	1450	“ Oh , please , ”
329645	329659	329660	329660	She	1450	“ It ’s a celebration . Banners , balloons , food , drink . ”
329680	329693	329660	329660	She	1450	“ This place is so well - stocked you would n’t believe . ”
329704	329709	329710	329710	I	5148	“ It ’s Damien , ”
329713	329720	329710	329710	I	5148	“ Excess is an art form . ”
329721	329725	329726	329726	he	5148	“ Watch it , ”
329759	329763	329764	329764	he	5148	“ Fuck reality , ”
329771	329785	329764	329764	he	5148	“ I want to stay in our bubble as long as we can . ”
329814	329822	329823	329823	Damien	5148	“ And where exactly are we going ? ”
329832	329838	329839	329839	I	5148	“ It ’s a surprise , ”
329842	329851	329839	329839	I	5148	“ Now shut up before I kill us . ”
329899	329921	329894	329894	He	5148	“ The good kind of surprise where I get to slowly strip you naked ? Or a bad kind of surprise ? ”
329922	329929	329930	329930	Jamie	1450	“ Oh . My . God , ”
329936	329946	329930	329930	Jamie	1450	“ I ’m going to just melt back here . ”
329957	329975	329947	329947	I	5148	“ Does any surprise that does n’t end with me naked fall within your definition of bad ? ”
329976	329980	329981	329981	he	5148	“ Pretty much , ”
330003	330016	330000	330000	I	5148	“ Then I guess we ’re deep in the land of horrible . ”
330056	330060	330061	330061	he	5148	“ All right , ”
330065	330069	330061	330061	he	5148	“ Tell me . ”
330070	330075	330076	330076	I	5148	“ You tell him , ”
330081	330087	330076	330076	I	5148	“ It was your idea . ”
330088	330101	330102	330102	she	4260	“ We found a bar in Crestline that has a karaoke night , ”
330105	330109	330110	330110	he	5148	“ Did you ? ”
330180	330188	330189	330189	he	5148	“ Are you going to serenade me ? ”
330192	330195	330189	330189	he	5148	“ Nope . ”
330196	330204	330218	330218	My	5148	“ Are you going to serenade Jamie ? ”
330205	330209	330189	330189	he	5148	“ Double nope . ”
330210	330214	330215	330215	he	5148	“ I see , ”
330348	330357	330358	330358	he	5148	“ And here I thought you loved me , ”
330370	330374	330361	330361	I	5148	“ I do . ”
330375	330395	330358	330358	he	5148	“ And you thought that singing bad seventies songs in public would be a good way to show it ? ”
330412	330421	330396	330396	I	5148	“ Are you mocking me , Mr. Stark ? ”
330422	330425	330426	330426	he	5148	“ Never , ”
330435	330473	330396	330396	I	5148	“ Mmm . I was actually thinking along the lines of the Rat Pack oeuvre , but I ’ll go with bad seventies if that ’s what you want . I ’m more than willing to compromise . ”
330480	330492	330474	330474	His	5148	“ I ’m very glad to hear it , Ms. Fairchild . ”
330493	330498	330499	330499	Jamie	1450	“ There it is , ”
330518	330538	330505	330505	She	4266	“ That ’s it , and thank God . It ’s getting just a little too warm in here . ”
330630	330637	330638	330638	he	5148	“ It ’s definitely got atmosphere , ”
330654	330660	330661	330661	Jamie	1450	“ What about that table ? ”
330682	330688	330689	330689	Jamie	1450	“ Order me something fun , ”

330770	330782	330765	330765	Damien	5148	“ Not planning to jump up and burst into song yourself ? ”
330783	330786	330787	330787	I	5148	“ No , ”
330790	330802	330787	330787	I	5148	“ At the moment , I do n’t need the pain . ”
330836	330839	330840	330840	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
330843	330851	330840	330840	I	5148	“ I should n’t joke about that . ”
330852	330860	330861	330861	he	5148	“ I do n’t mind the jokes , ”
330864	330886	330861	330861	he	5148	“ so long as you do n’t mind me second - guessing them to make sure there ’s no hidden agenda . ”
330984	330990	330991	330991	he	5148	“ I will always worry , ”
330995	331068	330991	330991	he	5148	“ There is no off switch , no pause button . You are the thing in this world that means the most to me , but we both know that I have come close to breaking you more than once . So get mad at me if you want , but do n’t tell me to stop being concerned or second - guessing you . I wo n’t . I ca n’t . ”
331074	331082	331083	331083	I	5148	“ It ’s not about my pain , ”
331097	331116	331083	331083	I	5148	“ It ’s about the pain of all these people were I to get up on this stage . ”
331117	331126	331127	331127	he	5148	“ Oh , but you ’re going to , ”
331133	331141	331083	331083	I	5148	“ Um , no . No way . ”
331142	331145	331146	331146	He	5148	“ Mmm . ”
331158	331162	331163	331163	he	5148	“ All right , ”
331166	331178	331163	331163	he	5148	“ You do n’t have to get up on the stage . ”

331572	331583	331584	331584	He	5148	“ So I ’m going to go with a serenade . ”
331590	331596	331584	331584	He	5148	“ For you , baby . ”
331661	331670	331651	331651	Damien	5148	“ You ’re Nobody Till Somebody Loves You . ”

332220	332240	332208	332208	She	1919	“ No , I ’m in a happy place . This is so nice . Y’all are so nice . ”
332249	332256	332241	332241	She	1919	“ Maybe we should go clubbing . ”
332257	332261	332262	332262	Damien	5148	“ Great idea , ”
332269	332284	332262	332262	Damien	5148	“ But I ’ve got a better one . How about we stay in ? ”
332292	332297	332298	332298	She	1919	“ Yes . Yes . ”
332303	332314	332315	332315	she	1919	“ He ’s so smart . And gorgeous , too , ”
332325	332329	332330	332330	I	5148	“ I know , ”
332351	332363	332364	332364	she	1919	“ I bet I can totally whup your ass at poker , ”
332372	332383	332367	332367	Damien	5148	“ Who am I to decline a challenge like that ? ”
332384	332389	332390	332390	I	5148	“ She ’s good , ”
332407	332418	332393	332393	She	1919	“ Of course she ’s better when she ’s sober . ”
332425	332440	332419	332419	Jamie	1450	“ Maybe I am sober . Maybe this is all just one big bluff . ”
332487	332499	332500	332500	I	5148	“ You should know that all of my illusions are shattered , ”
332504	332521	332500	332500	I	5148	“ I do n’t know if I can stay with a man who loses at poker . ”
332522	332531	332532	332532	he	5148	“ But I do it with such charm , ”
332550	332557	332558	332558	she	1919	“ I ’m just that awesome , ”
332561	332572	332558	332558	she	1919	“ Do n’t say that I did n’t warn you . ”
332607	332631	332597	332597	his	5148	“ You both do realize that poker is a game that develops over time . It ’s not about just a few hands . ”
332644	332655	332638	332638	she	1919	“ In other words , you ’re sizing me up . ”
332661	332667	332668	332668	I	5148	“ He better not be , ”
332690	332712	332677	332677	Jamie	1450	“ Yeah , well , then the joke ’s on you , because I think I have to pass out now . ”
332732	332735	332736	332736	I	5148	“ Jamie ? ”
332740	332745	332746	332746	Damien	5148	“ She ’s out , ”
332749	332758	332759	332759	I	5148	“ It ’s the whipped - cream vodka , ”
332762	332768	332759	332759	I	5148	“ That stuff ’s dangerous . ”
332769	332776	332790	332790	she	1919	“ Shall I move her inside ? ”
332814	332820	332790	332790	she	1919	“ Can you lift her ? ”
332821	332826	332827	332827	he	5148	“ She ’s tiny , ”
332830	332837	332838	332838	He	5148	“ I think I can manage . ”
332903	332917	332900	332900	her	1919	“ You ’re so good for her . You know that , right ? ”
332918	332925	332926	332926	Damien	5148	“ She ’s good for me , ”
332937	332944	332945	332945	Jamie	1450	“ That ’s what I mean , ”
333005	333013	333014	333014	Damien	5148	“ So tell me , Ms. Fairchild , ”
333025	333036	333014	333014	Damien	5148	“ How much whipped - cream vodka did you have ? ”
333037	333043	333044	333044	I	5148	“ Too sweet for me , ”
333047	333058	333044	333044	I	5148	“ But I ordered quite a few shots of Macallan . ”
333059	333072	333014	333014	Damien	5148	“ Did you ? That can increase a bar tab pretty quickly . ”
333089	333101	333073	333073	I	5148	“ Well , maybe you can win it back at poker . ”
333102	333109	333110	333110	he	5148	“ That ’s an interesting wager , ”
333113	333120	333110	333110	he	5148	“ I propose a small amendment . ”
333126	333132	333121	333121	I	5148	“ Negotiating , Mr. Stark ? ”
333133	333136	333137	333137	He	5148	“ Always . ”
333199	333206	333191	333191	he	5148	“ Strip poker , Ms. Fairchild . ”
333291	333298	333288	333288	I	5148	“ All right , Mr. Stark , ”
333318	333324	333310	333310	I	5148	“ Prepare to get naked . ”
333421	333430	333431	333431	I	5148	“ Are you sure you do n’t cheat ? ”
333434	333454	333431	333431	I	5148	“ As a rule , no . In order to see you naked , I would be sorely tempted . ”
333455	333458	333459	333459	I	5148	“ Aha ! ”
333470	333493	333467	333467	He	5148	“ Fortunately , your massive consumption of Scotch saved me the trouble . You ’re not playing your best , Ms. Fairchild . ”
333499	333511	333494	333494	I	5148	“ Have you considered that I ’m just setting you up ? ”
333512	333523	333524	333524	He	5148	“ Are you ? Well , that ’s interesting information . ”
333535	333544	333524	333524	He	5148	“ Let ’s see what you ’ve got . ”
333554	333563	333545	333545	I	5148	“ A pair of kings , ace high . ”
333564	333568	333569	333569	he	5148	“ Not bad , ”
333572	333582	333569	333569	he	5148	“ Too bad I have the other three aces . ”
333583	333588	333589	333589	I	5148	“ You do not , ”
333614	333619	333620	333620	he	5148	“ Off with it , ”
333635	333640	333641	333641	he	5148	“ Oh , no , ”
333653	333665	333641	333641	he	5148	“ The skirt . I ’ll get the zipper for you . ”
333707	333710	333711	333711	he	5148	“ Up , ”
333757	333762	333763	333763	he	5148	“ There you go , ”
333822	333825	333826	333826	I	5148	“ Deal , ”
333920	333923	333912	333912	he	5148	“ Nikki . ”
333924	333927	333928	333928	I	5148	“ What ? ”
333956	333960	333948	333948	he	5148	“ Your cards . ”
333971	333976	333961	333961	I	5148	“ Oh . Right . ”
333986	333989	333990	333990	I	5148	“ What ? ”
333993	334001	334002	334002	he	5148	“ I did n’t say a thing , ”
334005	334020	334002	334002	he	5148	“ But if I had , I probably would have told you to move . ”
334026	334030	334021	334021	I	5148	“ To move ? ”
334044	334049	334050	334050	he	5148	“ On your bottom , ”
334053	334058	334050	334050	he	5148	“ Your legs crossed . ”
334059	334064	334021	334021	I	5148	“ I — why ? ”
334065	334073	334074	334074	he	5148	“ Because I want to see you , ”
334082	334093	334077	334077	I	5148	“ Is that part of the game , Mr. Stark ? ”
334094	334158	334074	334074	he	5148	“ It is now . I want to see how wet you are . I want to know how much it turns you on sitting here across from me , slowly losing bits of your clothing , becoming more and more open to me . And all the while knowing that soon — very soon — I’m going to bury myself in you . ”
334159	334162	334163	334163	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
334186	334191	334192	334192	he	5148	“ Now , Nikki , ”
334195	334201	334192	334192	he	5148	“ You know the rules . ”
334202	334211	334212	334212	My	5148	“ Is that a command , Mr. Stark ? ”
334235	334241	334192	334192	he	5148	“ It most definitely is . ”
334242	334254	334192	334192	he	5148	“ So if I do n’t , I ’ll be punished ? ”
334259	334274	334255	334255	His	5148	“ I do n’t think you ’ll like the punishment I ’d render tonight . ”
334275	334285	334286	334286	I	5148	“ No ? Why ? What would you do ? ”
334376	334382	334383	334383	I	5148	“ What would you do ? ”
334386	334395	334396	334396	he	5148	“ It ’s what I would n’t do , ”
334418	334424	334425	334425	I	5148	“ That punishes us both , ”
334428	334433	334434	334434	he	5148	“ Rules are rules , ”
334437	334457	334458	334458	he	5148	“ And I can be very strong when I want to . But if you think I ’m bluffing … ”
334647	334653	334654	334654	Damien	5148	“ I like the view , ”
334657	334674	334654	334654	Damien	5148	“ I like seeing how much you want me . How wet you are for me . ”
334675	334679	334680	334680	I	5148	“ Am I ? ”
334718	334723	334724	334724	Damien	5148	“ Jesus , Nikki , ”
334837	334840	334841	334841	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
334844	334858	334841	334841	I	5148	“ You ’re right . I ’m very , very wet for you . ”
334859	334863	334864	334864	Damien	5148	“ Fuck poker , ”
334920	334930	334931	334931	I	5148	“ Are you conceding the game , Mr. Stark ? ”
334940	334944	334945	334945	he	5148	“ I am , ”
334955	334963	334948	334948	I	5148	“ I guess that means you lose . ”
334964	334967	334968	334968	he	5148	“ No , ”
334992	335002	334971	334971	he	5148	“ I assure you it means that I win . ”
335063	335071	335072	335072	I	5148	“ You ’re wrong , Mr. Stark , ”
335086	335093	335072	335072	I	5148	“ Tonight , we both win . ”
335153	335159	335160	335160	I	5148	“ Damien , wake up . ”
335165	335182	335160	335160	I	5148	“ Either we really set the sheets on fire , or something out there is burning . ”
335228	335235	335236	335236	he	3256	“ It ’s not a fire , ”
335271	335280	335281	335281	I	5148	“ I think I know what it is , ”
335320	335332	335333	335333	She	1450	“ Sorry ! I thought I ’d make breakfast , but — ”
335357	335371	335372	335372	I	5148	“ I do n’t think that pancakes are supposed to be served blackened , ”
335385	335396	335377	335377	She	1450	“ I had a little trouble incorporating the chocolate chips . ”
335410	335437	335397	335397	Damien	5148	“ As they say , it ’s the thought that counts . So I hope you do n’t mind if I just think about eating those . ”
335448	335463	335438	335438	Jamie	1450	“ Great . I ’m trapped in the mountains with a couple of comedians . ”
335464	335468	335469	335469	Damien	5148	“ Your choice , ”
335480	335499	335469	335469	Damien	5148	“ We either clean up and start over , or I ’ll take you ladies out to breakfast . ”
335500	335508	335509	335509	Jamie	1450	“ You ’re out of chocolate chips , ”
335533	335543	335512	335512	She	1450	“ Give me fifteen minutes to shower and change . ”
335680	335686	335687	335687	Jamie	1450	“ He cleans up well , ”
335699	335703	335704	335704	I	5148	“ He does , ”
335717	335723	335704	335704	I	5148	“ And he ’s mine . ”
335863	335873	335874	335874	Jamie	1450	“ That ’s more what I was going for , ”
335877	335904	335874	335874	Jamie	1450	“ But , hey , you can still thank me . If I had n’t completely trashed breakfast , we would n’t have a shopping morning . ”
335905	335911	335912	335912	Damien	5148	“ We ’re deeply grateful , ”
335971	335982	335983	335983	I	5148	“ I ’m going to fall into a food coma , ”
335986	335997	335998	335998	Jamie	1450	“ We ’ll work it off by walking the shops , ”
336010	336031	336001	336001	She	1450	“ You really are awesome , you know . Thanks for inviting me . I was having a shit week . ”
336032	336035	336036	336036	he	5148	“ Anytime , ”
336061	336068	336069	336069	I	5148	“ Hang on , you two . ”
336092	336112	336052	336052	She	1450	“ I ’d take some of the view , too , but the phone wo n’t do it justice . ”
336113	336125	336126	336126	Damien	5148	“ I think I can assure you we ’ll be back , ”
336129	336139	336140	336140	Jamie	1450	“ Or you can just buy a new camera , ”
336143	336169	336140	336140	Jamie	1450	“ For that matter , get one for each of his houses . That should ensure that Leica never goes out of business , right ? ”
336170	336176	336177	336177	Damien	0	“ Not a bad idea , ”
336188	336215	336177	336177	Damien	0	“ I like the idea of spreading you around all my properties . Hell , I like the idea of you naked in all my properties . ”
336243	336254	336255	336255	she	1450	“ Do n’t you guys ever give it a rest ? ”
336258	336262	336263	336263	Damien	0	“ Not really , ”
336281	336284	336285	336285	Jamie	1450	“ God , ”
336288	336301	336285	336285	Jamie	1450	“ I am so freaking jealous . Do you have a brother ? ”
336302	336306	336311	336311	Jamie	1450	“ Afraid not . ”
336307	336310	336311	336311	Jamie	1450	“ Figures , ”
336344	336362	336380	336380	she	1450	“ It sounds sappy as shit , but you two know how lucky you are , right ? ”
336363	336366	336367	336367	Damien	0	“ Yes , ”
336371	336375	336367	336367	Damien	0	“ We know . ”
336376	336379	336380	336380	she	1450	“ Good , ”
336387	336395	336380	336380	she	1450	“ Damn , but I needed this . ”
336396	336410	336411	336411	I	5148	“ Why did n’t you tell me about getting fired from the commercial ? ”
336420	336444	336414	336414	She	1450	“ You were a little preoccupied , and it ’s not like there was anything you could do , especially not from Germany . ”
336494	336502	336503	336503	Damien	0	“ There ’s something I can do , ”
336512	336571	336506	336506	She	1450	“ No , you helped me get the job in the first place . That was more than enough . They paid me for the gig anyway — they had to the way the contract was written — so I ’m good . I just need to think about how I ’m going to get my shit together . ”
336572	336576	336577	336577	Damien	0	“ You will , ”
336591	336596	336580	336580	Jamie	1450	“ Thanks . Really . ”
336597	336602	336603	336603	I	5148	“ You ’re welcome , ”
336606	336616	336603	336603	I	5148	“ And you know I love you , right ? ”
336617	336624	336625	336625	Jamie	1450	“ What ’s not to love ? ”
336656	336667	336645	336645	She	1450	“ You know people are staring at us , right ? ”
336705	336712	336713	336713	I	5148	“ It comes with the territory , ”
336722	336735	336736	336736	she	1450	“ Well , it ’ll be my first time in the tabloids , ”
336739	336753	336736	336736	she	1450	“ Guess that means I ’ve finally made it despite the stupid commercial . ”
336754	336761	336713	336713	I	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
336762	336787	336736	336736	she	1450	“ Damien Stark in a threesome , of course . It ’ll be all over the Internet by morning , do n’t you think ? ”
336795	336819	336788	336788	I	5148	“ Jesus , Jamie , do you think you could say that a little louder ? Or better yet , not at all ? ”
336820	336825	336826	336826	she	1450	“ I ’m joking , ”
336945	336951	336952	336952	I	5148	“ I want another coffee , ”
336969	336980	336952	336952	I	5148	“ And then I think it ’s time to shop . ”
336982	336989	336990	336990	I	5148	“ I like the cyan one , ”
337012	337017	336990	336990	I	5148	“ Not too loud ? ”
337018	337027	336990	336990	I	5148	“ For you ? Nothing ’s too loud . ”
337038	337077	337028	337028	She	1450	“ Okay . I should n’t , but I ’m going for it . I mean , I did just get paid . And I ought to get at least one nice thing out of that damn commercial . ”
337245	337248	337249	337249	Damien	5148	“ No , ”
337253	337378	337249	337249	Damien	5148	“ you need to understand me . This is my top priority . I want the entire thing gone over with a microscope . Whatever there is to learn , you learn it . You follow every thread , you go down every rabbit hole . Are we clear ? Good . Call me in a few hours with an update . Yes , a few hours . Fine . That ’s one thing settled , then . What about the gate ? Can we speed up the timetable on that ? Well , that ’s good news at least . Get that wrapped up today and make sure everyone has access . All right . Yes . I ’ll speak to you later . ”
337434	337438	337439	337439	I	5148	“ Something wrong ? ”
337447	337478	337442	337442	He	5148	“ Just the ins and outs of running the universe . I ’ve been somewhat absent for the last few weeks . A few things have slipped through the cracks . ”
337479	337486	337487	337487	I	5148	“ I do n’t see how , ”
337490	337501	337487	337487	I	5148	“ You had Stark Central set up in the hotel . ”
337502	337507	337508	337508	he	5148	“ It ’s nothing , ”
337516	337521	337522	337522	I	5148	“ You ’re worried , ”
337564	337568	337556	337556	he	5148	“ I am . ”
337569	337585	337586	337586	I	5148	“ Then I know it ’s not business . You do n’t worry about business , ”
337595	337601	337586	337586	I	5148	“ You just take charge . ”
337602	337612	337556	337556	he	5148	“ I did n’t realize I was so transparent . ”
337613	337618	337619	337619	I	5148	“ Only to me , ”
337622	337647	337619	337619	I	5148	“ So what is it , Damien ? Is it Sofia ? Is it that motion to release the photos ? Has something happened ? ”
337689	337703	337704	337704	he	5148	“ There are just a few things I need to follow up on , ”
337717	337733	337704	337704	he	5148	“ Business about which I ’m not worried , but which does require my attention . ”
337734	337738	337739	337739	I	5148	“ I see , ”
337754	337759	337760	337760	he	5148	“ And , yes , ”
337764	337772	337760	337760	he	5148	“ I ’m still worried about Sofia . ”
337793	337811	337760	337760	he	5148	“ You ’ll find her . Will you tell me as soon as you learn something new ? ”
337817	337821	337812	337812	His	5148	“ Of course . ”
337942	337948	337930	337930	Jamie	1450	“ Y’all worn out already ? ”
337949	337962	337963	337963	Damien	5148	“ I ’m afraid I need to head back to the house , ”
337966	337974	337963	337963	Damien	5148	“ But you two can continue shopping . ”
337975	337985	337986	337986	Jamie	1450	“ Not me . Not unless you want to . ”
338007	338014	338015	338015	she	1450	“ I want the hot tub , ”
338018	338027	338028	338028	Damien	5148	“ I think we can go one better , ”
338039	338094	338028	338028	Damien	5148	“ Sylvia , can you contact Adriana ? See if she can get someone to the Arrowhead house this afternoon for Ms. Fairchild and Ms. Archer . Yes , that ’s right . An hour . Call or text the details once you have them . Fine . I ’ll be in on Friday . ”
338115	338121	338095	338095	Jamie	1450	“ What ’s going on ? ”
338122	338134	338135	338135	he	5148	“ I thought you two might like massages on the patio , ”
338146	338153	338154	338154	she	4361	“ You know you ’re amazing , ”
338163	338170	338158	338158	He	5148	“ So I ’ve been told . ”
338210	338220	338221	338221	he	5148	“ Help yourself to whatever ’s in the fridge , ”
338224	338229	338221	338221	he	5148	“ including the champagne . ”
338287	338294	338295	338295	I	5148	“ Do n’t work too hard , ”
338298	338305	338306	338306	he	5148	“ Do n’t play too hard , ”
338309	338316	338295	338295	I	5148	“ Would n’t dream of it . ”
338402	338437	338395	338395	she	1450	“ I ca n’t even tell you how much I need this . And a massage , too ? I mean , seriously . There is a god , and his name is Damien . ”
338451	338465	338438	338438	She	1450	“ Seriously , Nik . I am totally in love with your boyfriend . ”
338466	338469	338470	338470	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
338473	338478	338470	338470	I	5148	“ Me , too . ”
338553	338556	338557	338557	he	5148	“ Hey , ”
338567	338573	338557	338557	he	5148	“ How was your day ? ”
338586	338592	338574	338574	I	5148	“ What time is it ? ”
338593	338598	338599	338599	he	5148	“ Just past six , ”
338632	338636	338637	338637	he	5148	“ Never mind , ”
338640	338654	338637	338637	he	5148	“ I can tell how your day was . And I ’m envious . ”
338655	338662	338663	338663	I	5148	“ You could have joined us , ”
338738	338748	338749	338749	he	5148	“ I figured I earned some downtime , too , ”
338752	338763	338749	338749	he	5148	“ Assuming you do n’t mind me joining the party ? ”
338764	338773	338774	338774	I	5148	“ I think we can suffer through it , ”
338785	338788	338789	338789	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
338792	338801	338789	338789	I	5148	“ Jamie needed this . And so did I. ”
338862	338876	338894	338894	his	5148	“ I ’m half - tempted to call Lisa and reschedule for Monday . ”
338877	338884	338885	338885	Jamie	1450	“ Oh , yes , please , ”
338910	338913	338914	338914	I	5148	“ No , ”
338918	338936	338914	338914	I	5148	“ I need to see this space , and I want to talk with Lisa , too . ”
338937	338945	338946	338946	Damien	5148	“ You ’re meeting her at ten ? ”
338955	338979	338946	338946	Damien	5148	“ We ’ll leave tomorrow morning . Edward can meet you at the tower and take you to the property in the limo . ”
338980	339003	338914	338914	I	5148	“ Um , I do n’t think so . Let ’s just leave early enough that you can drop me at home . ”
339004	339010	338946	338946	Damien	5148	“ I have early meetings . ”
339011	339022	338914	338914	I	5148	“ Then we ’ll have Edward drop me at home . ”
339023	339031	339032	339032	Damien	5148	“ That ’s a waste of time , ”
339035	339061	339032	339032	Damien	5148	“ You can dress here , then go straight to your meeting . I ’ll meet you afterward and you can give me the rundown . ”
339062	339065	339066	339066	I	5148	“ No , ”
339069	339074	339066	339066	I	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki — ”
339075	339078	339079	339079	I	5148	“ No . ”
339085	339110	339079	339079	I	5148	“ I do n’t know what ’s going on , but I know something is . And you can just spill it right now . ”
339117	339132	339114	339114	Jamie	1450	“ You know , I have a sudden urge to go reorganize my suitcase . ”
339155	339182	339183	339183	He	5148	“ Do n’t do this , Damien . This time whatever secret you ’re keeping is about me . And we both damn well know it . ”
339202	339208	339209	339209	he	5148	“ Your car was trashed , ”
339242	339246	339247	339247	I	5148	“ Say again , ”
339251	339260	339261	339261	he	5148	“ Someone threw paint all over your car , ”
339264	339297	339261	339261	he	5148	“ That ’s an irritation , but not irreversible . But they also jimmied a lock and filled it with raw fish . I sincerely doubt the smell will ever go away . ”
339298	339301	339302	339302	I	5148	“ I — ”
339319	339325	339310	339310	I	5148	“ How do you know ? ”
339330	339345	339326	339326	He	5148	“ I ’ve been concerned about the security at your condo for a while . ”
339346	339355	339356	339356	I	5148	“ But you already installed an alarm system , ”
339402	339456	339380	339380	she	1450	“ That ’s clearly not enough . I arranged with the property management to install a security gate for the parking area and to enclose the entry foyer . Two days ago , my crew found your car . Needless to say , I stepped up the schedule to get that work completed . ”
339473	339485	339486	339486	I	5148	“ You told me that call had to do with Sofia , ”
339489	339512	339486	339486	I	5148	“ No . I said there were things I had to take care of . And that I was worried about Sofia . ”
339513	339533	339486	339486	I	5148	“ Dammit , Damien , do n’t split hairs with me . You deliberately obfuscated the truth . Why ? ”
339534	339564	339486	339486	I	5148	“ Because I did n’t want that bubble of yours to pop yet . Not when I ’d brought you here to escape reality for a few more days . ”
339565	339568	339569	339569	I	5148	“ I — ”
339652	339655	339656	339656	I	5148	“ Fine , ”
339660	339679	339656	339656	I	5148	“ You ’re off the hook about not telling me . But I ’m not carpooling with Edward . ”
339680	339684	339685	339685	Damien	5148	“ You are , ”
339689	339710	339685	339685	Damien	5148	“ I ca n’t protect you from everything , but I ’m damn well protecting you from what I can . ”
339711	339728	339656	339656	I	5148	“ Forget it . I ’ll have the car detailed . I ’ll make it work . ”
339729	339774	339775	339775	he	5148	“ The hell you will . That car ’s too old for a decent security system , the smell is n’t going to disappear , and it ’s been on its last legs for a while . You told me so yourself . Besides , ”
339780	339793	339775	339775	he	5148	“ I already had my men arrange to donate her for parts . ”
339799	339807	339808	339808	I	5148	“ Are you kidding me ? No . ”
339813	339844	339845	339845	I	5148	“ Absolutely not . That car has too much sentimental value . I ’m not stripping her for parts . And who the hell do you think you are anyway ? ”
339853	339867	339868	339868	he	5148	“ I ’m the man who would die if something happened to you , ”
339898	339915	339845	339845	I	5148	“ That does n’t mean you get to micromanage my life . Or dissect my car . ”
339916	339988	339989	339989	He	5148	“ You want to keep the car , fine . Keep the car . We ’ll park it at Stark Tower . You can keep it forever for all I care . But I ’m buying you a new one with a perimeter - based security system , a GPS , an anti - theft tracking device , and whatever else goddamned security devices my tech team can come up with . ”
340002	340007	339845	339845	I	5148	“ You ’re buying ? ”
340008	340011	339845	339845	I	5148	“ Absolutely . ”
340012	340018	339845	339845	I	5148	“ The hell you are . ”
340019	340080	339845	339845	I	5148	“ Do n’t fight me on this , Nikki . Not on an issue of your safety . You want to keep the Honda , then keep it . I ’ll bronze the goddamn thing if you want me to and we can mount it in the entry - way . But you ’re getting a new car to drive . ”
340081	340084	340085	340085	I	5148	“ Fine , ”
340171	340178	340179	340179	I	5148	“ I ’ll get one myself , ”
340182	340204	340179	340179	I	5148	“ You want to shop with me and give your opinion , then fine . But I ’m writing the check . ”
340205	340209	340210	340210	he	5148	“ Fair enough , ”
340213	340224	340210	340210	he	5148	“ Until you get it , Edward can drive you . ”
340225	340230	340231	340231	I	5148	“ Oh , no , ”
340234	340247	340231	340231	I	5148	“ If we ’re doing this , we ’re doing it today . ”
340248	340251	340179	340179	I	5148	“ Today ? ”
340252	340286	340231	340231	I	5148	“ There are dealerships all up and down the 10 , right ? So let ’s just go home tonight instead of tomorrow morning . I ’ll get a car on the way . ”
340333	340336	340337	340337	he	5148	“ Fine , ”
340341	340352	340337	340337	he	5148	“ Get packed . We can leave whenever you want . ”
340376	340380	340381	340381	His	5148	“ Something else ? ”
340386	340390	340391	340391	I	5148	“ Just thanks , ”
340407	340416	340391	340391	I	5148	“ Does this mean you ’re not mad ? ”
340417	340435	340436	340436	I	5148	“ Oh , I ’m pissed as hell . But I get where you ’re coming from . ”
340444	340455	340436	340436	I	5148	“ But , Damien ? Do n’t do it again . ”
340465	340483	340456	340456	His	5148	“ No promises . Where your safety is concerned , there ’s not much room for compromise . ”
340511	340516	340517	340517	I	5148	“ Sucks for Jamie , ”
340530	340541	340517	340517	I	5148	“ I think she was looking forward to another night . ”
340542	340553	340554	340554	Damien	5148	“ She can have the entire weekend if she wants , ”
340557	340590	340554	340554	Damien	5148	“ We ’ll take the Jeep , but I ’ve got a car in the garage . I ’ll leave her the keys . Does she know how to drive a stick ? ”
340591	340594	340595	340595	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
340598	340609	340595	340595	I	5148	“ She does . What kind of car is it ? ”
340610	340614	340615	340615	he	5148	“ A Ferrari , ”
340623	340626	340554	340554	Damien	5148	“ What ? ”
340627	340630	340631	340631	I	5148	“ Nothing , ”
340634	340649	340631	340631	I	5148	“ Except that you ’re one hell of a nice man , Damien Stark . ”
340704	340714	340715	340715	I	5148	“ I hope you ’re not the jealous type , ”
340729	340742	340715	340715	I	5148	“ Because I think Cooper and I are about to become inseparable . ”
340743	340746	340747	340747	he	5148	“ Interesting , ”
340758	340787	340747	340747	he	5148	“ Perhaps I should n’t have left the Jeep for one of my assistants to pick up . I mean , if you two want some alone time . ”
340788	340797	340798	340798	I	5148	“ I know I must seem terribly fickle , ”
340802	340819	340798	340798	I	5148	“ But when true love strikes … well , you simply have to go with it . ”
340820	340823	340824	340824	he	5148	“ Yes , ”
340834	340838	340824	340824	he	5148	“ You do . ”
340889	340895	340936	340936	Damien	5148	“ Joyriding , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
340906	340920	340896	340896	I	5148	“ A little respect , please , Mr. Stark . We ’re bonding . ”
340921	340935	340936	340936	Damien	5148	“ I may have to call Coop out for a duel at dawn , ”
340939	340958	340936	340936	Damien	5148	“ Because I ’m not interested in sharing you . I want you all alone and to myself . ”
340959	340975	340896	340896	I	5148	“ Do you ? I have to admit , I like the sound of that . ”
340976	340985	340936	340936	Damien	5148	“ I ’m very relieved to hear it . ”
340986	340999	340896	340896	I	5148	“ Remember what I said about a Lamborghini being almost like foreplay ? ”
341000	341016	340936	340936	Damien	5148	“ It will be a very long time before I forget that , Ms. Fairchild . ”
341017	341024	340896	340896	I	5148	“ A Mini is , too . ”
341025	341030	341031	341031	Damien	5148	“ Is that so ? ”
341034	341066	341031	341031	Damien	5148	“ I confess I ’ve never thought of the Mini as sexy . Cute , absolutely . Eye - catching , most definitely . Sexy , I ’m not so sure . ”
341067	341075	341076	341076	I	5148	“ Do n’t wound Cooper ’s ego , ”
341079	341097	341076	341076	I	5148	“ Besides , it ’s not a question of appearance . It ’s a question of power . ”
341098	341103	341031	341031	Damien	5148	“ Is that so ? ”
341104	341108	341109	341109	I	5148	“ Feel that ? ”
341137	341140	341141	341141	I	5148	“ Power , ”
341144	341156	341141	341141	I	5148	“ And endurance . Very important qualities . In a car . ”
341157	341164	341165	341165	he	5148	“ I could n’t agree more , ”
341168	341173	341165	341165	he	5148	“ Responsiveness . Handling . ”
341174	341190	341141	341141	I	5148	“ Like I said , all things that turn you on . Ergo , foreplay . ”
341210	341217	341165	341165	he	5148	“ And what turns you on ? ”
341237	341241	341242	341242	I	5148	“ You do , ”
341271	341275	341264	341264	his	5148	“ Pull over . ”
341276	341279	341280	341280	We	4394	“ What ? ”
341302	341305	341306	341306	he	5148	“ There , ”
341336	341344	341306	341306	he	5148	“ Pull over , stop the car . ”
341351	341356	341357	341357	I	5148	“ What on earth — ”
341436	341448	341449	341449	Damien	5148	“ I think it ’s Cooper who ’s the jealous one , ”
341459	341464	341449	341449	Damien	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
341486	341490	341491	341491	he	5148	“ Stay put , ”
341535	341543	341544	341544	I	5148	“ I think I destroyed the mood , ”
341570	341573	341574	341574	he	5148	“ No , ”
341577	341602	341574	341574	he	5148	“ Just changed it a little . But how can there be anything but romance when we ’re floating above a blanket of stars ? ”
341603	341609	341610	341610	I	5148	“ Romance , Mr. Stark ? ”
341613	341627	341610	341610	I	5148	“ Not hot and sweaty sex in the back of a tiny car ? ”
341628	341631	341632	341632	he	5148	“ Romance , ”
341653	341656	341657	341657	My	5148	“ Damien … ”
341666	341670	341673	341673	he	5148	“ I know . ”
341681	341686	341673	341673	he	5148	“ Close your eyes . ”
341768	341771	341772	341772	he	5148	“ Hey , ”
341803	341808	341786	341786	he	5148	“ None of that . ”
341839	341844	341833	341833	he	5148	“ I love you , ”
341959	341964	341965	341965	I	5148	“ It looks nice , ”
342023	342027	342028	342028	he	5148	“ It does , ”
342031	342044	342045	342045	He	5148	“ But I ’m more interested in efficacy than in curb appeal . ”
342057	342065	342045	342045	He	5148	“ Someone could climb that pretty easily . ”
342076	342087	342066	342066	I	5148	“ Spider - Man maybe , but not normal people . ”
342088	342097	342098	342098	He	5148	“ That grid pattern could be a ladder . ”
342105	342143	342098	342098	He	5148	“ It ’s the typical design for a property gate , but most gates only serve the purpose of keeping non - residents from parking in the spaces . They ’re a deterrent . I want more . ”
342159	342164	342144	342144	I	5148	“ Who are you — ”
342165	342180	342098	342098	He	5148	“ Ryan . My security chief . I want him on this first thing . ”
342347	342351	342352	342352	I	5148	“ Your doing ? ”
342400	342402	342374	342374	I	5148	“ more ”
342426	342429	342430	342430	he	5148	“ Better , ”
342445	342447	342434	342434	he	5148	“ better ”
342451	342455	342434	342434	he	5148	“ good enough . ”
342587	342594	342595	342595	Damien	5148	“ I guess she told you , ”
342603	342611	342612	342612	Jamie	1450	“ At least she looks well fed . ”
342673	342683	342684	342684	I	5148	“ I ca n’t believe she left it here , ”
343034	343037	343038	343038	Damien	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
343064	343069	343046	343046	he	5148	“ What is it ? ”
343140	343143	343179	343179	He	5148	“ Nikki . ”
343144	343147	343148	343148	I	5148	“ There . ”
343246	343253	343254	343254	His	5148	“ Where did you get this ? ”
343297	343303	343304	343304	he	5148	“ Son of a bitch , ”
343334	343342	343320	343320	I	5148	“ Someone got hold of your stationery ? ”
343343	343346	343347	343347	he	5148	“ No , ”
343350	343369	343370	343370	he	5148	“ The motherfucker just wanted you to think it was from me . Look closely — don’t touch , ”
343377	343395	343396	343396	He	5148	“ It ’s printed with a regular laser printer . Our envelopes are professionally embossed . Shit . ”
343416	343421	343409	343409	he	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
343422	343427	343428	343428	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
343432	343447	343448	343448	I	5148	“ I was freaked at first , but that was just shock . Really , ”
343470	343485	343452	343452	he	5148	“ I ’m okay now . Honest . I ’m more pissed than scared . ”
343499	343503	343504	343504	he	5148	“ All right , ”
343507	343524	343504	343504	he	5148	“ Get me a freezer bag . I ’ll get this to Ryan in the morning . ”
343615	343620	343621	343621	he	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
343635	343657	343627	343627	I	5148	“ What the hell for ? You ’re not the one sending me nasty notes or dumping fish in my car . ”
343658	343663	343664	343664	he	5148	“ I ’m not , ”
343667	343678	343664	343664	he	5148	“ But it would appear that I ’m the reason . ”
343679	343686	343687	343687	We	4435	“ That ’s hardly breaking news . ”
343730	343739	343740	343740	He	5148	“ No . I suppose it ’s not . ”
343750	343760	343740	343740	He	5148	“ I want you to move in with me . ”
343953	343956	343945	343945	my	5148	“ No . ”
343957	343960	343961	343961	I	5148	“ What ? ”
343990	343995	343978	343978	I	5148	“ I said no . ”
343996	343999	344000	344000	His	5148	“ No ? ”
344012	344022	344000	344000	His	5148	“ Goddammit , Nikki , why the hell not ? ”
344058	344079	344045	344045	I	5148	“ Do you want me to live with you because you love me or because you want to protect me ? ”
344104	344122	344080	344080	He	5148	“ I want you with me , Nikki . And dammit , you want it , too . ”
344141	344144	344145	344145	he	5148	“ Shit , ”
344161	344210	344155	344155	I	5148	“ As much as I hate that , the bottom line is that mail ca n’t hurt me , Damien , and the condo is safe . Your own team scoped it out . Or should I assume that the security team at Stark International does subpar work ? ”
344211	344221	344222	344222	He	5148	“ I have certain expectations regarding everything I own . ”
344265	344276	344260	344260	I	5148	“ Am I one of your possessions , Mr. Stark ? ”
344307	344315	344316	344316	he	5148	“ I believe we had an arrangement , ”
344394	344397	344382	344382	I	5148	“ Damien . ”
344398	344405	344406	344406	I	5148	“ There are rules , remember ? ”
344428	344444	344445	344445	he	5148	“ You ’re mine , Nikki . Whenever and however I want . And wherever , ”
344486	344496	344459	344459	his	5148	“ And where I want you is with me . ”
344497	344504	344505	344505	I	5148	“ I am always with you , ”
344596	344606	344584	344584	I	5148	“ But I ’m not moving in with you . ”
344617	344628	344607	344607	He	5148	“ Dammit , Nikki , this is n’t a game . ”
344634	344641	344629	344629	I	5148	“ Is n’t it , sir ? ”
344678	344685	344669	344669	I	5148	“ Damien , I ’m fine . ”
344693	344739	344669	344669	I	5148	“ That letter gives me jitters , too , but it ’s just mail and bullshit . No one ’s in the condo . I mean , Jesus , you ’ve turned this place into a fortress . Just give it a rest , okay ? ”
344740	344746	344747	344747	he	5148	“ The hell I will , ”
344750	344772	344773	344773	He	5148	“ I want you safe . Nothing is going to happen to you . I ’m not losing you the way — ”
344785	344810	344773	344773	He	5148	“ What ? Dammit , Damien , is this about Sofia ? You think her having gone missing has something to do with you ? ”
344811	344824	344825	344825	he	5148	“ I do n’t have a clue why she ’s gone missing , ”
344828	344846	344847	344847	I	5148	“ And it ’s driving you crazy . And you are n’t telling me a goddamn thing . ”
344938	344948	345008	345008	He	5148	“ Do not fight me on this , Nikki . ”
344949	345007	345021	345021	He	5148	“ Hell yes , I ’m fighting . Why bother to put the gate around my apartment if you ’re not going to trust that it will do its job ? I mean , I do n’t like getting nasty mail any more than you do , but for all we know it was mailed from Antarctica . ”
345041	345049	345050	345050	he	5148	“ I do n’t like being defied , ”
345066	345075	345053	345053	I	5148	“ I do n’t like being bossed around . ”
345090	345104	345053	345053	I	5148	“ You ’re not winning this one , Damien . Deal with it . ”
345120	345133	345105	345105	His	5148	“ Do you have any idea how frustrated I am right now ? ”
345153	345161	345162	345162	My	5148	“ I know what you ’re doing . ”
345166	345172	345162	345162	My	5148	“ It wo n’t work . ”
345173	345178	345203	345203	He	5148	“ Wo n’t it ? ”
345195	345202	345186	345186	his	5148	“ I ’m not giving in . ”
345218	345225	345226	345226	he	5148	“ I ’ll have you safe , ”
345324	345334	345335	345335	he	5148	“ I want to cup my hand around you , ”
345446	345465	345466	345466	he	5148	“ That protective bubble you mentioned ? I want to keep you locked inside . Whatever it takes , ”
345469	345481	345466	345466	he	5148	“ You ca n’t possibly know how much I need you . ”
345482	345486	345487	345487	I	5148	“ I do . ”
345547	345599	345541	345541	his	5148	“ It ’s too big , too powerful . There is no start and no end , nothing with which I can measure the length and breadth of what I feel for you . I look at you and wonder how I can possibly survive the riot of emotions within me . ”
345600	345608	345609	345609	My	5148	“ You make it sound almost painful . ”
345617	345648	345541	345541	his	5148	“ You and I know better than anyone how pain and pleasure walk hand in hand . Passion , Nikki , remember ? And with you , it fills me . ”
345668	345817	345541	345541	his	5148	“ I want to hold you close . To cherish and protect you . To draw you in until we are so close that I am lost within you . I want to take you to bed , to watch the way your skin tightens beneath my fingers , the way your body awakens under my touch . I want to trail kisses over you until you are lost in so much pleasure that you do n’t know where you end and I begin . I want to tie you up and fuck you until there is no doubt that you are mine . I want to dress you up and take you out , and show you off , this beautiful , vibrant , brilliant woman . Everything I ’ve built ? All my companies ? All my billions ? They have no value compared to you . ”
345837	345884	345826	345826	he	5148	“ So no , Nikki . I will not take chances with your safety . I will not fight . I will not be defied . You do n’t want to move in with me . That ’s fine . I ’ll move in with you . ”
345885	345888	345889	345889	I	5148	“ Wait . ”
345919	345922	345901	345901	I	5148	“ What ? ”
345923	345932	345948	345948	he	5148	“ You heard me . End of subject . ”
345933	345938	345901	345901	I	5148	“ Damien , I — ”
345978	346004	345959	345959	I	5148	“ I ’m going to tie you up now , Nikki , and there will be no argument , no retraction . Are we clear ? ”
346041	346050	346051	346051	He	5148	“ But first , I need you naked . ”
346119	346124	346125	346125	he	5148	“ I like this , ”
346132	346145	346146	346146	he	5148	“ I think we ’ll keep this on . Now turn over , ”
346156	346163	346146	346146	he	5148	“ On your hands and knees . ”
346175	346178	346179	346179	he	5148	“ Over , ”
346263	346266	346267	346267	he	5148	“ Beautiful , ”
346277	346292	346267	346267	he	5148	“ Now put your head on the mattress , but keep your ass up . ”
346311	346318	346319	346319	I	5148	“ Oh , yes , baby . ”
346336	346447	346326	346326	his	5148	“ I want your ass in the air and your cunt open to me . I ’m going to fuck you , Nikki . I ’m going to fuck you until we lose ourselves in each other . Until the universe swallows us whole . I ’m going to make you come harder and longer than you ever have before , baby , and I ’m going to feel every shudder , every ripple of that orgasm as it rips through you because I am going to be right here holding tight to you , buried deep inside you . And , Nikki , I ’m not ever letting go . ”
346487	346511	346466	346466	He	0	“ You can either be quiet , or you can say ‘ Yes , sir . ’ There are n’t any other choices . ”
346569	346574	346575	346575	I	5148	“ Yes , sir , ”
346606	346609	346602	346602	he	0	“ Good . ”
346724	346732	346737	346737	he	0	“ What are you doing with those ? ”
346790	346796	346797	346797	he	0	“ For a good cause , ”
346800	346809	346787	346787	He	0	“ Trust me . This view is amazing . ”
346874	346881	346882	346882	I	5148	“ I want to see you , ”
346885	346897	346882	346882	I	5148	“ Please , Damien . I want you naked , too . ”
346898	346902	346903	346903	He	0	“ Do you ? ”
347295	347302	347303	347303	he	5148	“ That ’s it , baby , ”
347396	347401	347402	347402	he	5148	“ Not just yet , ”
347430	347449	347418	347418	He	5148	“ Do you remember what you told me once ? About how you own a very nice vibrator ? ”
347506	347509	347510	347510	He	5148	“ Nikki ? ”
347631	347684	347623	347623	he	5148	“ Do you want me to touch you , Nikki ? My palm stroking you ? My fingers filling your cunt ? Do you want me to spread you wide and thrust inside you , our bodies moving together , my hand on your clit stroking and teasing until we both explode ? ”
347706	347719	347738	347738	he	5148	“ Then tell me where , baby . Just tell me where . ”
347720	347723	347724	347724	I	5148	“ Drawer , ”
347727	347731	347724	347724	I	5148	“ Bedside drawer . ”
347807	347815	347816	347816	he	5148	“ Is this how you use it ? ”
347819	347836	347837	347837	he	5148	“ Stroking your clit ? Making it hard and hot and ready ? Or like this ? ”
347850	347855	347837	347837	he	5148	“ Or maybe both ? ”
347907	347912	347913	347913	I	5148	“ I — yes , ”
347963	347974	347975	347975	he	5148	“ I do n’t like you saying no to me , ”
347978	347996	347975	347975	he	5148	“ If this is my punishment , I think I may have to say it more often . ”
347997	348000	347975	347975	he	5148	“ Mmm . ”
348055	348058	348059	348059	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
348062	348068	348059	348059	I	5148	“ What are you doing ? ”
348069	348073	348074	348074	he	5148	“ Fucking you , ”
348229	348235	348236	348236	he	5148	“ You ’re so hot , ”
348239	348249	348236	348236	he	5148	“ So wet , so goddamned tight around me . ”
348250	348253	348254	348254	I	5148	“ Harder , ”
348272	348275	348254	348254	I	5148	“ More . ”
348872	348877	348866	348866	He	5148	“ Are you okay ? ”
348878	348881	348882	348882	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
348892	348905	348882	348882	I	5148	“ Yes , I ’m fine . Now , I ’m fine . ”
349003	349008	349009	349009	I	5148	“ I ’m fine , ”
349018	349023	349009	349009	I	5148	“ I have you . ”
349024	349028	349029	349029	he	5148	“ You do , ”
349044	349085	349029	349029	he	5148	“ I ’ll give you the choice of Malibu or downtown , but until we catch whoever is doing this , you are staying with me . And that is not a subject that is open to debate any longer . ”
349127	349135	349136	349136	I	5148	“ I ’d rather stay in Malibu , ”
349139	349146	349136	349136	I	5148	“ But there ’s no furniture . ”
349194	349202	349203	349203	he	4459	“ I ’ll have it brought back , ”
349206	349226	349227	349227	He	4459	“ And I ’ll have Sylvia arrange to rent enough furniture to make the rest of the house livable . ”
349236	349261	349227	349227	He	4459	“ We can decorate slowly , and as we find pieces we like , we ’ll kick the rented pieces out on their asses . ”
349326	349331	349332	349332	he	5148	“ What about Jamie ? ”
349335	349350	349332	349332	he	5148	“ Is she staying with us , or are we getting her a hotel ? ”
349381	349385	349386	349386	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
349389	349403	349386	349386	I	5148	“ Knowing Jamie , she ’d love to stay at the Malibu house . ”
349404	349444	349450	349450	I	5148	“ I ’ll have Sylvia get a key and the security code to her in Arrowhead , and send someone over here to pack some of Jamie ’s things . She can go straight to Malibu when she returns . ”
349445	349449	349450	349450	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
349454	349461	349450	349450	I	5148	“ What else do you need ? ”
349475	349487	349462	349462	I	5148	“ Can you arrange to just have all this be over ? ”
349488	349494	349495	349495	he	5148	“ I wish I could , ”
349567	349573	349574	349574	I	5148	“ Maybe it ’s Carmela , ”
349577	349582	349583	349583	Damien	5148	“ Not her style , ”
349589	349598	349583	349583	Damien	5148	“ but I have my people looking anyway . ”
349599	349610	349611	349611	I	5148	“ You ’ve been keeping me out of the loop . ”
349757	349777	349796	349796	he	5148	“ I did n’t see the point of burying you in this crap if we did n’t know anything . ”
349783	349790	349778	349778	I	5148	“ You ’re protecting me again . ”
349791	349795	349796	349796	he	5148	“ I am , ”
349799	349830	349796	349796	he	5148	“ And as I believe I already explained in rather intimate detail , I do n’t intend to stop . Do you have a problem with that , Ms. Fairchild ? ”
349831	349846	349847	349847	I	5148	“ Only if you ’re keeping me out of the loop to do it , ”
349850	349859	349847	349847	I	5148	“ So what have n’t you told me ? ”
349860	349864	349865	349865	he	5148	“ Not much , ”
349884	349939	349847	349847	I	5148	“ Start with the painting . Have you learned anything about who leaked the story that I ’m the model ? Or that you paid me so much ? Because that first letter came about that time , so I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to assume it ’s the same person . ”
349940	349948	349949	349949	he	5148	“ I happen to agree with you , ”
349952	349966	349949	349949	he	5148	“ And the short answer is no , we have n’t found anyone . ”
349967	349973	349847	349847	I	5148	“ And the longer answer ? ”
349974	349980	349981	349981	He	5148	“ Will have to wait . ”
349999	350003	349981	349981	He	5148	“ My team . ”
350059	350064	350065	350065	I	5148	“ The longer answer ? ”
350074	350105	350106	350106	I	5148	“ We have a few leads . Arnold — he ’s the investigator I keep on retainer — recently got copies of some security footage from an ATM on Fairfax . ”
350113	350139	350106	350106	I	5148	“ That ATM happens to be across the street from a coffee bar where our intrepid reporter has a habit of meeting with his sources . ”
350140	350143	350144	350144	I	5148	“ Wow , ”
350172	350208	350106	350106	I	5148	“ It ’s going to take a while . The camera ’s focus is concentrated on a certain perimeter . But Arnold thinks he has a way to pop the focus on the background activity . ”
350209	350215	350216	350216	I	5148	“ That will take time , ”
350219	350236	350216	350216	I	5148	“ Especially since we do n’t know what day he might have met with the source . ”
350237	350244	350245	350245	Damien	5148	“ Unfortunately , you ’re right , ”
350248	350283	350245	350245	Damien	5148	“ But we have a rough time frame , and at the very least he can start pulling prints and getting them to me . With luck , there will be someone I recognize . ”
350284	350292	350216	350216	I	5148	“ Should n’t I look , too ? ”
350293	350297	350298	350298	he	5148	“ You should , ”
350301	350337	350338	350338	he	5148	“ But the odds are good that whoever is doing this is trying to get to me . I have Ryan ’s team investigating the players in a few particularly contentious deals I have brewing , ”
350347	350369	350216	350216	I	5148	“ Distract you by harassing your girlfriend , and maybe you wo n’t be such a hard - ass in negotiations ? ”
350370	350375	350216	350216	I	5148	“ Something like that . ”
350376	350383	350384	350384	I	5148	“ It might not be business , ”
350387	350429	350384	350384	I	5148	“ You ’ve slept with a lot of women , Damien . Even if you were n’t serious about them , that does n’t mean they were n’t serious about you . And one of them might be the jealous type . ”
350430	350443	350216	350216	I	5148	“ Agreed . And we ’re pursuing that avenue , as well . ”
350444	350464	350384	350384	I	5148	“ What about the anonymous letter that came to Stark Tower ? Or the text I got in Munich ? ”
350465	350469	350470	350470	Damien	5148	“ Nothing yet , ”
350473	350481	350482	350482	He	5148	“ But we have n’t given up . ”
350499	350502	350503	350503	he	5148	“ Anything ? ”
350517	350521	350522	350522	he	5148	“ Good thinking , ”
350526	350536	350522	350522	he	5148	“ That just might work out well for us . ”
350537	350542	350543	350543	he	5148	“ That was Ryan , ”
350553	350603	350543	350543	he	5148	“ The cameras at the entrance and the parking garage caught our culprit . Tall , wiry . Completely covered in a black hoodie and sunglasses . Kept his or her head down , but Ethan says the gait looks to be male , and quite possibly a teenager . ”
350604	350610	350522	350522	he	5148	“ A teenager ? But — ”
350611	350641	350543	350543	he	5148	“ I ’m guessing someone hired him . Our perp loiters around the convenience store , asks a kid if they ’d like to earn a few extra bucks . ”
350642	350645	350522	350522	he	5148	“ Oh . ”
350650	350665	350522	350522	he	5148	“ Fortunately , there are cameras in strip malls . We might get lucky . ”
350683	350697	350676	350676	I	5148	“ I ’m going to assign someone from my security team to you . ”
350703	350718	350676	350676	I	5148	“ The hell you are . I ’m not living my life under surveillance . ”
350719	350724	350666	350666	I	5148	“ It ’s necessary . ”
350725	350737	350676	350676	I	5148	“ You do n’t have the Secret Service following you around . ”
350774	350795	350676	350676	I	5148	“ I have a team available when I need them . But there ’s no indication I ’m in danger . ”
350865	350868	350869	350869	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
350873	350886	350869	350869	he	5148	“ Do you think I could survive if something happened to you ? ”
350916	350920	350921	350921	I	5148	“ All right , ”
350924	350981	350921	350921	I	5148	“ But not someone who flanks me , and not an obvious tail . But if you want to have someone hang out at the office if I end up renting it , I wo n’t object . And I ’m guessing you already have access to that tracking device we had installed in the car . ”
350982	350988	350989	350989	he	5148	“ I could access it , ”
350992	351009	350989	350989	he	5148	“ But not without some trouble . I ’d rather install something I can monitor openly . ”
351010	351013	351014	351014	I	5148	“ Done , ”
351017	351022	351023	351023	he	5148	“ And your phone , ”
351029	351035	351026	351026	I	5148	“ What about my phone ? ”
351036	351066	350989	350989	he	5148	“ I want to be able to track you with it . There are apps that will allow me to do that . I ’m going to install one . ”
351067	351079	351026	351026	I	5148	“ Just like that ? No ‘ Mother May I ’ ? ”
351080	351083	351084	351084	he	5148	“ No , ”
351166	351176	351177	351177	he	5148	“ So you ’ll never lose me , either , ”
351180	351183	351184	351184	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
351239	351243	351244	351244	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
351247	351257	351258	351258	he	5148	“ I ’m never letting you go , Nikki , ”
351269	351279	351258	351258	he	5148	“ I ’d never forgive you if you did . ”
351299	351302	351303	351303	she	837	“ So ? ”
351322	351328	351314	351314	she	837	“ What do you think ? ”
351329	351334	351335	351335	I	5148	“ I love it , ”
351469	351475	351476	351476	Lisa	837	“ It ’s available immediately , ”
351479	351486	351476	351476	Lisa	837	“ My client ’s very eager . ”
351678	351685	351686	351686	Lisa	837	“ It ’s a great opportunity , ”
351689	351693	351694	351694	I	5148	“ I know , ”
351880	351888	351889	351889	I	5148	“ I can just work from home , ”
351893	351897	351898	351898	Lisa	837	“ No question , ”
351901	351920	351898	351898	Lisa	837	“ I have lots of clients who do that . Most start - ups begin in the home . ”
351933	351940	351941	351941	she	837	“ But what about your roommate ? ”
351944	351974	351941	351941	she	837	“ Jamie , right ? You said she ’s an actress ? Does she have a steady job ? I mean , is she a regular on a show ? ”
351975	351987	351988	351988	Jamie	1450	“ No , but what does that — oh . Right . ”
352055	352064	352065	352065	Lisa	837	“ I put together a plan for you , ”
352129	352148	352149	352149	she	837	“ There are at least two dozen organizations in town focusing on women in tech - related fields , ”
352152	352202	352149	352149	she	837	“ You ca n’t ask for a better way to meet potential business partners or clients . As for the entertainment contacts , it ’s a bit of a stretch , but you ’re on the radar now , like it or not . Might as well use it . ”
352288	352293	352294	352294	she	837	“ That ’s conservative , ”
352297	352335	352294	352294	she	837	“ But as you can see , I expect you to be very solidly in the black within six months , and any start - up capital that you pull from your savings will be fully recouped . ”
352347	352368	352336	352336	I	5148	“ Lisa , this is great . But it must have taken you forever to pull together , and I — ”
352403	352412	352413	352413	she	837	“ I ’m happy to help a friend , ”
352416	352432	352413	352413	she	837	“ Even one I barely know because we got off to such a crazy start . ”
352501	352509	352510	352510	she	837	“ Not that I ’m totally altruistic , ”
352520	352527	352510	352510	she	837	“ I expect some awesome referrals . ”
352545	352552	352553	352553	she	837	“ I need to take this , ”
352556	352571	352553	352553	she	837	“ Take a look at the rest of that and give me a sec . ”
352967	352970	352971	352971	I	5148	“ Giselle , ”
352975	352983	352971	352971	I	5148	“ What can I do for you ? ”
352984	352996	352997	352997	Her	4516	“ I was actually hoping I could do something for you . ”
353012	353019	352971	352971	I	5148	“ Oh . Um , okay ? ”
353023	353083	353020	353020	She	4516	“ Sorry . That was rather vague , was n’t it ? But Evelyn was just at the gallery , and she mentioned that you ’re considering getting office space . I thought perhaps I could come take a look . Give you some ideas for sprucing it up . Maybe lend you a few canvases to add color . ”
353101	353121	353084	353084	I	5148	“ That ’s incredibly nice of you , but I ’ll probably just cover the walls with white boards . ”
353122	353128	353084	353084	I	5148	“ Oh . I see . ”
353150	353159	353160	353160	Giselle	2551	“ I just wanted to make the offer . ”
353166	353193	353160	353160	Giselle	2551	“ The truth is I know I can never make it up to you for what happened , but I thought this might be a start . ”
353198	353201	353202	353202	she	837	“ Listen , ”
353222	353266	353202	353202	she	837	“ I know we got off on the wrong foot . Blaine is a good friend and a client , and he absolutely adores you . It goes without saying that Damien adores you . I feel terrible that my stupidity hurt you . ”
353267	353272	353273	353273	I	5148	“ I appreciate that , ”
353296	353306	353280	353280	I	5148	“ How about this afternoon ? Maybe around four ? ”
353332	353335	353336	353336	I	5148	“ Ah , ”
353342	353353	353336	353336	I	5148	“ It is available right now , is n’t it ? ”
353357	353391	353354	353354	She	837	“ We never did get that coffee . Come on . There ’s a Starbucks on the corner . We can go over paperwork and do the ceremonial latte - based key transfer . ”
353629	353633	353634	353634	he	1353	“ Nikki Fairchild ? ”
353657	353661	353662	353662	I	5148	“ Thank you , ”
353745	353748	353749	353749	Lisa	837	“ Wow , ”
353758	353768	353769	353769	I	5148	“ Damien is all about the wow - factor , ”
353819	353834	353835	353835	I	5148	“ So now that I ’ve told half the world I have an office , ”
353838	353848	353849	353849	She	837	“ I guess we ought to do the paperwork . ”
353901	353907	353908	353908	she	837	“ Not to be crude , ”
353911	353928	353908	353908	she	837	“ But you ’re sleeping with the best business resource around . Take advantage of it . ”
353929	353937	353938	353938	I	5148	“ Oh , I fully intend to , ”
353989	354043	353974	353974	she	837	“ Want to check it out next week ? You can tell me all about your first few days among the self - employed . Or , hell , drag along your roommate and we ’ll talk about men . I ’m engaged , but that does n’t mean I ca n’t dish . ”
354047	354053	354044	354044	I	5148	“ It ’s a date . ”
354054	354057	354058	354058	She	837	“ Excellent . ”
354068	354085	354058	354058	She	837	“ I ’ve got to go meet a client . You walking back or hanging out ? ”
354086	354107	354108	354108	I	5148	“ I ’m going to finish my coffee and make some notes while all this is fresh in my mind , ”
354273	354285	354286	354286	she	761	“ I really do n’t mean to be a huge pest , ”
354307	354328	354286	354286	she	761	“ But it ’s driving me crazy . I know you from somewhere and I ca n’t figure it out . ”
354329	354334	354335	354335	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
354338	354345	354335	354335	I	5148	“ I do n’t think so . ”
354372	354393	354394	354394	She	761	“ Are you sure ? You look so familiar . I ’m Monica , by the way . Monica Karts . ”
354402	354411	354394	354394	She	761	“ Does n’t ring any bells , huh ? ”
354412	354415	354416	354416	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
354456	354466	354467	354467	I	5148	“ I probably just have one of those faces , ”
354473	354483	354467	354467	I	5148	“ But it was lovely to talk to you . ”
354484	354489	354490	354490	she	646	“ Oh , hell , ”
354493	354506	354507	354507	She	646	“ My agent is always telling me I come on too strong . ”
354518	354546	354507	354507	She	646	“ Sorry if I bugged you . You do n’t have to leave . I need to get back to this anyway . Audition ’s this afternoon . ”
354547	354555	354556	354556	I	5148	“ You did n’t run me off , ”
354559	354570	354556	354556	I	5148	“ I just need to get back to my office . ”
354592	354599	354600	354600	I	5148	“ Good luck with your audition , ”
354669	354673	354665	354665	Monica	692	“ Jamie Archer . ”
354677	354682	354674	354674	I	5148	“ You know Jamie ? ”
354683	354705	354674	354674	I	5148	“ Were n’t you at The Rooftop bar about a month ago with her ? One of Garreth Todd ’s parties ? ”
354706	354709	354710	354710	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
354713	354720	354721	354721	She	646	“ Well , so was I ! ”
354743	354753	354730	354730	I	5148	“ So you ’re a friend of Jamie ’s ? ”
354761	354801	354754	354754	She	646	“ I barely know her . But I was at an audition with her once , and I remember seeing her there . And you , too . But I think I ’m mostly remembering you from the newspapers . ”
354802	354805	354806	354806	I	5148	“ Great , ”
354810	354820	354821	354821	she	646	“ That stuff they said about you was shit , ”
354825	354860	354821	354821	she	646	“ Except the part about a reality show . If that ’s true you should totally take it and make as much money as you can and tell them all to go to hell . ”
354922	354954	354914	354914	Monica	692	“ I better get back to this . But I ’m so glad I figured it out . Maybe I ’ll see you again . I come here all the time . ”
354955	354958	354959	354959	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
354968	354981	354914	354914	Monica	692	“ Well , Texas ? Are you a proud new business owner ? ”
354982	354990	354991	354991	I	5148	“ Evelyn ! Hang on a sec . ”
355033	355039	355040	355040	I	5148	“ Can you believe it ? ”
355043	355050	355040	355040	I	5148	“ I feel all grown up . ”
355051	355058	355059	355059	she	692	“ I ’m proud of you , ”
355062	355075	355059	355059	she	692	“ And I mean that in a totally non - patronizing way . ”
355076	355084	355085	355085	I	5148	“ In that case , thank you . ”
355135	355143	355107	355107	She	5962	“ So tell me about the place . ”
355166	355176	355177	355177	she	5962	“ I probably owe you an apology for that , ”
355180	355205	355177	355177	she	5962	“ I know she ’s not high on your list these days , but she seemed pretty intent on making it up to you . ”
355206	355211	355212	355212	I	5148	“ No , no , ”
355215	355239	355212	355212	I	5148	“ It ’s fine . I ’ve got my jealousy all reined in , and I know she feels bad about what happened . ”
355319	355327	355328	355328	Evelyn	5962	“ So when can I see it ? ”
355331	355339	355380	355380	She	5962	“ It ? You mean the office ? ”
355340	355349	355380	355380	She	5962	“ You ’re there now , I assume ? ”
355350	355358	355380	355380	She	5962	“ On my way back from Starbucks . ”
355359	355379	355380	355380	She	5962	“ Good . Give me the address . I ’m in the area . I ’ll be right over . ”
355403	355407	355408	355408	she	5962	“ Not bad , ”
355414	355420	355408	355408	she	5962	“ Not bad at all . ”
355421	355430	355431	355431	I	5148	“ You ’re completely transparent , you know , ”
355434	355458	355431	355431	I	5148	“ There is no way that you were in the area . Sherman Oaks ? You ? Sorry . Just not buying it . ”
355459	355462	355463	355463	she	5962	“ Busted , ”
355469	355531	355463	355463	she	5962	“ No , the truth is I had a meeting with a director friend , and he ’s doing reshoots all day at Universal . But I would have come to see you , anyway . We have business to discuss , Texas , and I ’m damn sure not letting someone else steal my thunder as your very first client . ”
355532	355537	355538	355538	I	5148	“ In that case , ”
355547	355559	355538	355538	I	5148	“ pull up a chair and let ’s talk about it . ”
355599	355606	355607	355607	she	5962	“ I talked to Charlie today , ”
355625	355655	355656	355656	She	5962	“ Could n’t get him to give me the details of why he ’s still in Munich , but he did mention that Sofia ’s on the loose again . ”
355663	355684	355656	355656	She	5962	“ I swear , it ’s a wonder that girl did n’t drive Damien out of his head ages ago . ”
355685	355694	355610	355610	she	5962	“ So she ’s always been like this ? ”
355695	355740	355656	355656	She	5962	“ Oh , yeah . Smart as a whip , that one . Reminds me of you in a lot of ways . But she does n’t have your backbone , she ’s never learned to cope , and she runs instead of fighting . ”
355763	355772	355773	355773	Evelyn	5962	“ Do n’t you pull that with me , ”
355780	355843	355773	355773	Evelyn	5962	“ You ’re a survivor , Texas , and we both know it . I never played the bullshit card with my clients , and I sure as hell do n’t do it with my friends . And it ’s a damn good thing you ’re a survivor , too . Because no one else could last a week with our boy . ”
355903	355965	355855	355855	her	5962	“ I can tell you the exact way it ’ll play out when she finally turns up , too . Damien will head over to London to make sure she ’s okay and get her admitted to yet another facility . And the press will start speculating that Damien ’s tossing Sofia aside in favor of you . Or vice versa . ”
355966	355990	356066	356066	she	4558	“ Tossing her aside ? But they ’re not together . Damien told me they have n’t been together since they were kids . ”
355991	356033	355855	355855	her	5962	“ When has the truth ever bothered the press ? Every time they ’re photographed together , the London papers practically have them engaged . It ’ll be more interesting this time around , now that you ’re in the picture . ”
356034	356044	356045	356045	I	5148	“ Interesting is n’t the word I ’d choose , ”
356049	356065	356066	356066	she	4558	“ If you ca n’t make them stop , at least let them entertain you , ”
356081	356086	356087	356087	she	4558	“ Speaking of speculation , ”
356090	356103	356087	356087	she	4558	“ the rumors are also flying that I ’m returning to agenting . ”
356104	356108	356087	356087	she	4558	“ Are you ? ”
356109	356113	356114	356114	she	4558	“ Fuck no , ”
356130	356194	356195	356195	she	4558	“ But my old firm ’s been doing the full - court press , trying to get me back behind a phone and a desk . And you know what ? Who knows . Maybe if they sweeten the pot enough I ’ll reconsider . Right now I ’m just amusing myself watching them run around talking up potential projects . Like yours , ”
356202	356208	356087	356087	she	4558	“ Mine ? My what ? ”
356209	356262	356263	356263	she	4558	“ Take your pick , Texas . There are producers salivating to get you on reality TV . And there are at least half a dozen companies looking to hire you to do product endorsements . Want to be the face of a makeup line ? I could arrange it like that , ”
356279	356286	356273	356273	I	5148	“ This is the weirdest city . ”
356290	356297	356287	356287	Evelyn	5962	“ Hell , yes it is . ”
356298	356336	356287	356287	Evelyn	5962	“ If they ’re just looking for a face , tell them to look at Jamie ’s . I look better in real life than I do on film , but Jamie was made for the camera . ”
356337	356344	356345	356345	I	5148	“ Good point there , Texas . ”
356458	356468	356473	356473	she	5962	“ Oh , right . Send her on back . ”
356626	356628	356614	356614	she	692	“ date ”
356632	356635	356614	356614	she	692	“ screwed . ”
356636	356639	356640	356640	she	692	“ Nikki ! ”
356752	356759	356760	356760	she	692	“ It ’s a great space , ”
356763	356862	356863	356863	she	692	“ Small , but airy and well laid out . This beige on the walls is hideous , so that ’s the first thing we ’ll want to change . Then we ’ll want to hang some art . Not too much . Probably one large piece to anchor the room , and then a few smaller pieces to provide some balance . I have some artists in mind — I’ll bring a portfolio by the next time I come . And some paint chips , too . Something professional , but bright . Maybe a pale yellow , ”
356916	356925	356896	356896	she	692	“ Thanks again for letting me do this . ”
356926	356929	356930	356930	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
356933	356980	356930	356930	I	5148	“ I have to be honest . The rent on this place is n’t bad , but it ’s more than I planned to spend my first year out of the gate . I do n’t know that I can justify a decorating expense , too . ”
356993	357062	356981	356981	She	692	“ No , no . You misunderstand me . This is my treat . Well , for the first year . Then if you want to keep the canvases , you can either buy them or we can discuss a lease . As for the painting , this place is a shoebox — no offense — and I ’m sure I already have the perfect color in storage . ”
357073	357112	357063	357063	I	5148	“ Giselle , I know that you did n’t mean to upset me when you told Bruce about the portrait . If you owe me anything , it ’s an apology , and you ’ve already done that . ”
357144	357186	357133	357133	she	4568	“ I appreciate that , I really do . But I want to do this . I know how much all the press bothered you , and I ca n’t help but think that maybe that ’s my doing , too . ”
357192	357198	357187	357187	I	5148	“ What do you mean ? ”
357199	357233	357133	357133	she	4568	“ Well , I obviously was n’t thinking . What if Bruce said something ? What if I told someone else and just do n’t remember ? What if someone overheard us talking ? ”
357241	357282	357234	357234	Her	4568	“ Even if that ’s what happened , it ’s blown over . And , honestly , Giselle , I do n’t want to stick my nose into your business , but can you really afford to work for free ? ”
357365	357421	357355	357355	she	4568	“ The truth is that I ca n’t afford to make ends meet with just the gallery . I know that Damien and Evelyn are n’t gossiping about me , but at the same time , people talk , so I ’m sure you ’ve heard that my divorce is not , well , pleasant . ”
357434	357440	357441	357441	she	4568	“ Be careful of men , ”
357445	357460	357461	357461	She	4568	“ Fuck them , but do n’t trust them . Not any of them . ”
357467	357499	357500	357500	she	4568	“ That ’s a lesson I should have learned before I married Bruce . It sure as hell applied to the men in my life back then . All of them , ”
357503	357511	357512	357512	I	5148	“ I could n’t live like that , ”
357604	357676	357587	357587	she	651	“ Sorry . I ’m too bitter by half . The point is that I need to increase my cash flow , and so I ’m ramping up my design work again . And I could use this — doing your office , I mean . I do n’t want to be crude , but having Damien Stark ’s girlfriend on my client list is n’t going to hurt my business . ”
357769	357773	357774	357774	I	5148	“ All right , ”
357777	357785	357774	357774	I	5148	“ I guess we have a deal . ”
357786	357789	357790	357790	Her	2551	“ Fabulous . ”
357802	357819	357820	357820	she	2551	“ I ’ll pull some material together and give you a call . In the meantime , ”
357829	357840	357820	357820	she	2551	“ be sure and give Damien a kiss for me . ”
357951	357959	357960	357960	she	356	“ It ’s been a crazy day , ”
357963	357978	357960	357960	she	356	“ Since he just got back , everyone wanted a piece of his time . ”
357991	358000	358001	358001	she	356	“ He should be done soon , though , ”
358004	358012	358001	358001	she	356	“ Shall I have him call you ? ”
358431	358436	358413	358413	I	5148	“ Bad first day ? ”
358485	358489	358490	358490	I	5148	“ Not anymore , ”
358493	358500	358490	358490	I	5148	“ How did you get in ? ”
358501	358515	358532	358532	He	5148	“ Apparently your receptionist reads the papers . She knows we ’re together . ”
358527	358531	358516	358516	I	5148	“ Are we ? ”
358556	358560	358546	358546	He	5148	“ We are . ”
358561	358564	358565	358565	I	5148	“ Well , ”
358576	358584	358565	358565	I	5148	“ That ’s very good to know . ”
358585	358597	358598	358598	he	5148	“ You look very authoritative behind that desk , Ms. Fairchild , ”
358608	358617	358598	358598	he	5148	“ So this is where the magic happens ? ”
358638	358648	358598	358598	he	5148	“ It ’s pretty cool , is n’t it ? ”
358649	358654	358655	358655	he	5148	“ It ’s wonderful , ”
358658	358674	358655	358655	he	5148	“ I ’m so proud of you . Tell me all about your first day . ”
358718	358726	358727	358727	I	5148	“ I even have my first client , ”
358740	358745	358746	358746	he	5148	“ You ’re amazing , ”
358749	358758	358759	358759	I	5148	“ It feels good . You were right , ”
358762	358772	358759	358759	I	5148	“ I took the plunge and it feels great . ”
358773	358779	358780	358780	he	5148	“ I knew it would , ”
358790	358797	358798	358798	He	5148	“ I thought of you today . ”
358824	358835	358816	358816	him	5148	“ I pictured you the way you were last night . ”
358836	358839	358840	358840	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
358850	358870	358871	358871	He	5148	“ Then I pictured you like that here . Naked and bound and ready for me . Wanting me . ”
358902	358909	358884	358884	I	5148	“ I — oh . Yes . ”
358910	358918	358950	358950	His	5148	“ It ’s intoxicating , you know . ”
358943	358949	358937	358937	his	5148	“ Um , what is ? ”
358970	359075	358958	358958	he	5148	“ Knowing that I can bring a powerful woman like you to her knees . A woman with her own company , her own empire . Knowing that I can make her wet with my words . That my voice can make her nipples peak and her clit tingle . That I can shove her skirt up and turn her over her very own desk and spank that perfect white ass until it glows and then , when the scent of her arousal covers the desk and fills the room , I can fuck her until she comes so hard she screams for mercy . ”
359076	359083	359084	359084	My	5148	“ Oh , God , Damien … ”
359093	359105	358958	358958	he	5148	“ Stand up , Nikki . Go over toward the window . ”
359164	359170	359155	359155	he	5148	“ Take off the jacket . ”
359186	359191	359197	359197	his	5148	“ Now the skirt . ”
359308	359314	359315	359315	I	5148	“ Well , Mr. Stark , ”
359324	359333	359315	359315	I	5148	“ What do you want from me now ? ”
359357	359360	359361	359361	he	5148	“ Stop , ”
359442	359448	359429	359429	I	5148	“ Like what you see ? ”
359449	359454	359455	359455	he	5148	“ Oh , yes , ”
359608	359626	359591	359591	he	5148	“ Spread your legs — that ’s my girl . Now stay still for just a moment . ”
359917	359920	359921	359921	he	5148	“ No , ”
359924	359927	359921	359921	he	5148	“ Stop . ”
359928	359931	359910	359910	I	5148	“ Stop ? ”
359953	359958	359937	359937	I	5148	“ Yes , sir . ”
359959	359976	359977	359977	he	5148	“ Good girl . Now spread your legs , just a little . That ’s right , ”
359983	359988	359977	359977	he	5148	“ Stay like that . ”
360033	360040	360041	360041	he	5148	“ There ’s something I want , ”
360168	360172	360173	360173	he	5148	“ Not that , ”
360182	360186	360176	360176	I	5148	“ Then what ? ”
360187	360193	360176	360176	I	5148	“ I want to watch . ”
360194	360197	360198	360198	I	5148	“ Damien … ”
360230	360235	360236	360236	he	5148	“ Close your eyes , ”
360239	360242	360176	360176	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
360243	360249	360292	360292	I	5148	“ Because I said to . ”
360255	360291	360295	360295	he	5148	“ Good girl . Now take off your top . Do it slowly . Take the hem , and hold it as you trail your fingers up . That ’s it , just like that . ”
360335	360341	360342	360342	he	5148	“ Imagine it ’s me , ”
360345	360379	360380	360380	he	5148	“ My hands easing your shirt off . My hands cupping your breasts , pulling the cup of your bra down so that you spill out over the top . That ’s it , ”
360399	360425	360380	360380	he	5148	“ Do you feel my touch ? The way I ’m tugging your nipples ? The way I ’m stroking my fingertip over your areolae ? ”
360456	360459	360439	360439	I	5148	“ Damien — ”
360460	360487	360380	360380	he	5148	“ I know , baby . You can feel it , ca n’t you ? The way your sex throbs . How hard your clit is . ”
360488	360491	360439	360439	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
360492	360530	360380	360380	he	5148	“ We ’ve done this before , remember ? Our first night . You in the back of my limo , and I was miles away on my phone and so hard I thought I ’d explode . ”
360694	360712	360691	360691	his	5148	“ I did n’t have the pleasure of watching then . I intend to enjoy it now . ”
360713	360718	360735	360735	my	5148	“ Yes . Yes . ”
360738	360768	360691	360691	his	5148	“ Slide your right hand down . Take your time , baby . You have such soft skin , I want you to feel it . To touch it . ”
360845	360850	360851	360851	Damien	5148	“ Open your eyes , ”
360854	360862	360851	360851	Damien	5148	“ Look at me and touch yourself . ”
360863	360866	360868	360868	my	5148	“ I — ”
360943	360947	360948	360948	I	5148	“ Fuck me , ”
360951	360959	360948	360948	I	5148	“ We both know you want to . ”
360960	360965	360966	360966	he	5148	“ More than anything , ”
360997	361001	361002	361002	he	5148	“ But no , ”
361011	361026	361002	361002	he	5148	“ This is about you . I want you to feel it , too . ”
361027	361031	361002	361002	he	5148	“ Feel what ? ”
361032	361041	361042	361042	he	5148	“ The pleasure I take from your body , ”
361046	361063	361042	361042	he	5148	“ I want to watch . I want to lose myself in the vision of you . ”
361079	361155	361072	361072	his	5148	“ Do n’t stop , baby . Slide your fingers inside . Tease your clit . Let me see it . Let me watch the way your skin moves when you ’re about to come . Each tiny gasp , each shudder . The way you drag your teeth over your lower lip . The flush that colors your skin before orgasm , and the just - fucked look in your eyes after you come . ”
361215	361259	361188	361188	I	5148	“ Oh , God , Nikki . Do you know how much watching you turns me on ? How hot you make me ? I have only begun to memorize the bits and pieces that make up you . You are my obsession . ”
361260	361263	361264	361264	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
361267	361272	361264	361264	I	5148	“ Oh , yes . ”
361287	361292	361293	361293	he	5148	“ Do n’t stop , ”
361296	361301	361293	361293	he	5148	“ Just ignore it . ”
361372	361437	361471	361472	The receptionist	1384	“ Do n’t even think about it , baby . Just this . Just us . You ’re so close , Nikki . God , I can see it on your face , in the way your lips are parted . Imagine it ’s my mouth on your cunt , my tongue stroking you , tasting you . Baby , you taste so good . ”
361466	361470	361471	361472	The receptionist	1384	“ Ms. Fairchild ? ”
361497	361501	361502	361502	he	5148	“ Ignore it , ”
361519	361529	361530	361530	she	1384	“ Mr. Stark ’s assistant is on the phone , ”
361543	361564	361530	361530	she	1384	“ Apparently a Ms. Archer has been trying to reach you . I ’m afraid there ’s been an accident . ”
361651	361656	361657	361657	she	1384	“ I ’m sorry ! ”
361665	361673	361657	361657	she	1384	“ I ’m so , so sorry . ”
361674	361680	361657	361657	she	1384	“ But are you okay ? ”
361732	361755	361756	361756	She	1384	“ I ’m banged up , but I ’ll be fine . Really . But — I mean — oh , shit . ”
361762	361779	361756	361756	She	1384	“ Oh , God , Damien . The Ferrari ’s toast . I totally fucked up . ”
361780	361787	361788	361788	he	5148	“ You ’re not badly hurt , ”
361815	361822	361796	361796	He	5148	“ That ’s all that matters . ”
361823	361830	361831	361831	I	5148	“ Is the other driver okay ? ”
361834	361840	361841	361841	she	1384	“ It was just me , ”
361855	361863	361841	361841	she	1384	“ I ’m such a fucking loser . ”
361872	361887	361888	361888	I	5148	“ You ’re not , and you know it . It was an accident , ”
361921	361928	361929	361929	I	5148	“ So tell me what happened , ”
362014	362028	362029	362029	she	1450	“ I went down the mountain to go check out some happy hours , ”
362032	362061	362062	362062	She	1450	“ I mean , I had this frigging awesome car , so why not , right ? And I met this guy and he was so totally hot . ”
362071	362080	362116	362116	Damien	5148	“ Would you like me to step out ? ”
362085	362115	362081	362081	Her	1450	“ No ! I mean , you deserve to know how I totaled your car . And it ’s not like my reputation does n’t precede me , right ? ”
362123	362127	362128	362128	I	5148	“ Go on , ”
362131	362157	362158	362158	she	1450	“ Well , there were sparks , you know ? And I have n’t banged anyone since Raine except for that one time with Douglas , ”
362169	362172	362173	362173	she	1450	“ Honest , ”
362186	362238	362239	362239	she	1450	“ I was practically a nun while you two were in Germany . Anyway , he needed a ride home , and I was happy to oblige because , well , why would n’t I be ? And that part was great . And the part after was great , too , ”
362296	362300	362286	362286	I	5148	“ Go on . ”
362301	362351	362265	362265	She	1450	“ So I ’m lying there , right ? And it ’s nice . I mean he ’s nice . Or at least , I think he is . Until this alarm clock beside the bed goes off . Then he sits up and starts pulling on his clothes . ”
362377	362420	362286	362286	I	5148	“ I ask him why he ’s getting dressed , and he snaps at me to hurry . Because his wife — his fucking wife — is going to be home soon and I need to get the hell out of there . ”
362421	362426	362286	362286	I	5148	“ Oh , Jamie … ”
362427	362478	362479	362479	She	4607	“ I know , I know . Believe me , I know . But right then I was just pissed . And scared , because he tells me his wife ’s a cop . I mean , seriously , it ’s like a goddamned movie of the week or something . ”
362486	362561	362479	362479	She	4607	“ So I ’m hurrying , right ? And he ’s pushing me to move faster , and he ’s basically turned into this total asshole . And I swear , if she was n’t a woman who carried a gun I would have stayed and told her that her fucktard of a husband screwed around . But I ’m not keen on getting shot and he ’s practically screaming at me by now . ”
362562	362571	362286	362286	I	5148	“ And somehow the wife caused the accident ? ”
362577	362766	362572	362572	Jamie	1450	“ Other than by coming home and scaring the crap out of me ? No . But I pull out of his house and I head down the street to get out of the subdivision and back to the main road . I ’m distracted , and I know I ’m driving faster than I should , and — oh , Damien — I’m so , so sorry . But that was it . Just too fast . I was n’t being reckless , I swear to God . But when I turn the corner , this other car is pulling out . They could n’t have planned the timing better if they tried . I mean , it was like they were just waiting for me to come , which is stupid , right , but that ’s just the kind of day I was having . So I swerve , and I lose control and I wrap the car around this huge stone fence that marks the edge of the development . The airbags did their thing , but I still managed to bang my head . ”
362778	362790	362767	362767	She	4608	“ I ’m not even sure what I hit it on . ”
362803	362854	362797	362797	she	4608	“ So that ’s it . The whole thing was my fault . I was pissed off and driving too fast and the whole goddamn thing is because I spread my legs for some fucking stranger who only wanted a quick lay while his wife was off catching bad guys . ”
362917	362923	362911	362911	I	5148	“ I told you so , ”
362947	362958	362959	362959	I	5148	“ You scared the shit out of me , James , ”
362973	362984	362959	362959	I	5148	“ What would I do if something happened to you ? ”
363245	363251	363252	363252	Damien	5148	“ Nectar of the gods , ”
363279	363289	363290	363290	I	5148	“ The gods are n’t too picky this morning , ”
363301	363315	363293	363293	He	5148	“ I ’m sure Edward will be happy to stop for a latte . ”
363321	363327	363316	363316	I	5148	“ Why is Edward here ? ”
363328	363340	363316	363316	I	5148	“ I ’m sending you and Jamie home in the limo . ”
363341	363350	363351	363351	I	5148	“ We ’re not riding back with you ? ”
363397	363400	363401	363401	I	5148	“ Sorry , ”
363404	363412	363401	363401	I	5148	“ I know you have to work . ”
363413	363424	363425	363425	he	225	“ There are things I need to take care of , ”
363437	363445	363446	363446	he	225	“ I ’m going to San Diego , ”
363454	363457	363458	363459	His father	5071	“ Oh . ”
363509	363513	363501	363502	Jeremiah Stark	5148	“ Hurry back , ”
363584	363589	363590	363590	I	5148	“ I love you , ”
363605	363614	363593	363593	He	5071	“ Stop worrying . I ’ll be fine . ”
363656	363670	363671	363671	Jamie	1450	“ If I have a mimosa , are you going to lecture me ? ”
363674	363683	363684	363684	I	5148	“ I have n’t lectured you at all , ”
363688	363710	363684	363684	I	5148	“ I ’ve been extremely non - lecturey . And it ’s not like you have a drinking problem , James . ”
363711	363716	363717	363717	she	1450	“ You ’re right , ”
363749	363764	363742	363743	Best friend	4624	“ I do n’t have a drinking problem ; I have a fucking problem . ”
363809	363813	363814	363814	she	1450	“ I know , ”
363817	363828	363814	363814	she	1450	“ Nothing you have n’t been telling me for years . ”
363829	363841	363842	363842	I	5148	“ I just do n’t want to see you get hurt , ”
363845	363859	363842	363842	I	5148	“ You were lucky , James . But this could have been bad . ”
363897	363902	363903	363903	she	1450	“ I called Ollie , ”
363914	363923	363924	363924	she	1450	“ I ’m elaborating on my fucking problem , ”
363932	363945	363924	363924	she	1450	“ I called him after Raine got me fired from the commercial . ”
363946	363951	363952	363952	I	5148	“ Oh , Jamie , ”
363955	363982	363952	363952	I	5148	“ You promised me . For that matter , he promised me . He told me there was n’t anything going on with you two anymore . ”
363983	363993	363924	363924	she	1450	“ Wait . You talked to him ? When ? ”
363994	364000	364001	364001	I	5148	“ He was in Germany , ”
364004	364021	364001	364001	I	5148	“ The firm sent him over to help with the trial . You did n’t know ? ”
364027	364047	364022	364022	She	4626	“ I have n’t seen him . Not since … well , not since he came over that night . ”
364048	364053	364022	364022	She	4626	“ You called him . ”
364073	364092	364022	364022	She	4626	“ I needed someone to talk to , and he ’s the dude who had the golden ticket . ”
364093	364100	364101	364101	I	5148	“ And you slept with him ? ”
364121	364129	364130	364130	She	4626	“ We did n’t ! I swear ! ”
364141	364151	364130	364130	She	4626	“ But there was a tug , you know ? ”
364165	364178	364152	364152	I	5148	“ He ’s engaged , Jamie . And he ’s a mess . ”
364179	364202	364248	364248	she	4626	“ As to the first , I know . As to the second , so am I. Maybe we ’re soul mates . ”
364203	364212	364152	364152	I	5148	“ Friends , yes . Lovers , no . ”
364243	364247	364248	364248	she	4626	“ I know , ”
364251	364266	364248	364248	she	4626	“ I really do . You ’d be proud of me . Nothing happened . ”
364267	364272	364273	364273	I	5148	“ Proud of you ? ”
364305	364312	364313	364313	she	4626	“ You ’re missing the point , ”
364316	364364	364365	364365	She	4626	“ I did n’t sleep with Ollie . And I really wanted to because of the commercial and I felt lower than dirt , and , well , you know . But I didn’t — and I thought maybe that meant I was getting my act together . ”
364371	364386	364365	364365	She	4626	“ And then I go and fuck an asshole and wreck Damien ’s Ferrari . ”
364457	364468	364445	364445	I	5148	“ The bottom line is that I worry about you . ”
364469	364475	364476	364476	she	4626	“ I know you do , ”
364480	364486	364476	364476	she	4626	“ I do , too . ”
364515	364525	364506	364506	Jamie	1450	“ I ’m thinking about going back to Texas . ”
364555	364645	364540	364540	she	4626	“ I ca n’t afford to keep the condo , though . So you ’ll have to find another roommate . Unless you move in with Damien . If you do that , I might sell . The market ’s gotten better . I might even make enough to buy a place in Dallas and have some cash leftover to pay Damien for at least part of the mess I made of his car . I figure my condo should cover about a hubcap , do n’t you think ? ”
364646	364668	364762	364762	she	4630	“ Wait , back up . What are you talking about ? You hate Dallas . You ’ve always hated Dallas . ”
364669	364701	364540	364540	she	4626	“ Look at me , Nik . I ’m a mess . I go from fucking movie stars to screwing strangers . But all I ’m really doing is screwing myself . ”
364702	364708	364709	364709	I	5148	“ I do n’t disagree , ”
364713	364725	364709	364709	I	5148	“ But moving to Dallas does n’t change anything but geography . ”
364726	364745	364540	364540	she	4626	“ Maybe that ’ll be enough . Maybe there ’s too much noise here . Too much temptation . ”
364796	364807	364808	364808	I	5148	“ Just think about it before you do anything rash , ”
364827	364835	364836	364836	she	4630	“ I would n’t dream of it , ”
364886	364896	364897	364897	Jamie	1450	“ Did you see that we ’re finally famous ? ”
364911	364914	364897	364897	Jamie	1450	“ What ? ”
364915	364946	364947	364947	She	4630	“ Or , I am . Damien ’s been famous forever , and you ’ve been racking up your share of the press , too . But check it out . ”
364962	364982	364947	364947	She	4630	“ I took screenshots of all the stuff I found on the Internet . Just check out my photos . ”
365044	365052	365053	365053	she	4630	“ That one ’s all over Twitter , ”
365056	365081	365053	365053	she	4630	“ I ’m not sure if it ’s because Damien ’s famous or because he ’s fuckalicious , but it ’s totally gone viral . ”
365082	365090	365091	365091	I	5148	“ Maybe it ’s because of you , ”
365195	365202	365203	365203	she	4638	“ This is not Studio City , ”
365216	365226	365203	365203	she	4638	“ You ’re staying at Damien ’s Malibu house . ”
365236	365252	365227	365227	Her	4638	“ I was kidding about that threesome . But if it ’s important to Damien … ”
365261	365268	365269	365269	I	5148	“ I ca n’t hear you , ”
365283	365286	365287	365287	she	4638	“ Seriously , ”
365290	365316	365287	365287	she	4638	“ why am I staying in Malibu ? Because if this is my punishment for wrecking his Ferrari , he kind of missed the mark . ”
365317	365321	365322	365322	I	5148	“ Not punishment , ”
365325	365328	365322	365322	I	5148	“ Pragmatism . ”
365352	365383	365344	365344	Her	4638	“ Whoa . At least you do n’t have to deal with your fruitcake of a mother . You can thank me for taking that burden off you , anyway . ”
365384	365397	365398	365398	I	5148	“ You ’ve been dealing with my mother ? How ? Why ? ”
365428	365504	365403	365403	she	4638	“ She called me about a week ago — in a total Elizabeth Fairchild snit , I might add — and told me that since I was your best friend , could I please get you a message . Apparently — her words , not mine — you are emotionally confused , overwhelmed by your rich and bossy new boyfriend , and taking the whole thing out on her by ignoring her calls and emails . ”
365505	365508	365509	365509	I	5148	“ Shit , ”
365512	365515	365509	365509	I	5148	“ Sorry . ”
365516	365561	365577	365577	She	4645	“ No , it ’s okay . When she called , I was pissed off at my mom for some bullshit thing I do n’t even remember now . After talking with your mother , I was practically giddy about my entire family tree . ”
365562	365565	365566	365566	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
365570	365576	365566	365566	I	5148	“ Now I feel better . ”
365581	365648	365577	365577	She	4645	“ Anyway , I guess she ’s pissed that you sent someone to get all those old pictures of you , but then you ditched her calls . I ’d ditch the calls , too , Nik , but why on earth would you tell someone to see your mom for old pictures ? Who do you dislike so much you ’d send them her way ? ”
365649	365654	365655	365655	I	5148	“ I did n’t , ”
365674	365681	365682	365682	Jamie	1450	“ It may not be bad , ”
365693	365715	365682	365682	Jamie	1450	“ It ’s probably just a reporter . Someone putting together the definitive article on the girl who got Damien Stark . ”
365738	365767	365768	365768	She	1450	“ As of now , we ’re entering a worry - free zone . For the rest of the day , nothing but sand and surf and margaritas . ”
365774	365777	365768	365768	She	1450	“ Deal ? ”
365778	365781	365782	365782	I	5148	“ Deal , ”
366203	366208	366209	366209	he	5148	“ I used you , ”
366223	366226	366227	366227	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
366281	366286	366287	366287	I	5148	“ God , yes . ”
367379	367388	367389	367389	I	5148	“ I did n’t want to interrupt you , ”
367409	367420	367393	367393	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry . I should n’t have stayed . ”
367421	367424	367389	367389	I	5148	“ No . ”
367430	367438	367439	367439	He	5148	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
367455	367468	367393	367393	I	5148	“ You did n’t tell me you went ahead with the court . ”
367469	367489	367490	367490	His	5148	“ How could I not after you teased me with the possibility of you in a tiny tennis dress ? ”
367506	367523	367490	367490	His	5148	“ I ’ve had a crew working on it since just before I left for Germany . ”
367524	367529	367530	367530	I	5148	“ I ’m glad . ”
367634	367640	367641	367641	I	5148	“ Was it your father ? ”
367645	367659	367641	367641	I	5148	“ Is he the one who turned the photos over to the court ? ”
367820	367830	367831	367831	he	243	“ I do n’t think it was my father , ”
367834	367847	367831	367831	he	243	“ He seemed genuinely baffled when I confronted him about the pictures . ”
367848	367851	367852	367852	My	5148	“ Oh . ”
367860	367873	367852	367852	My	5148	“ So you do n’t have any idea who it could be ? ”
367886	367891	367892	367892	he	243	“ I do n’t , ”
367901	367908	367892	367892	he	243	“ I ’m worried about Sofia . ”
367916	367944	367909	367909	I	5148	“ I know you are , but she ’ll check in . If she ’s playing roadie to a band in Shanghai , she ’s probably not — ”
367945	367953	367954	367954	Damien	5148	“ I ’m afraid she ’s running , ”
367958	367967	367968	367968	He	243	“ I ’m afraid someone ’s harassing her . ”
367979	367984	367985	367985	I	5148	“ Oh , God , ”
367991	368011	367985	367985	I	5148	“ You think someone is trying to get to you through the women you love . Me . Sofia . ”
368012	368019	368020	368020	He	243	“ I think it ’s possible . ”
368032	368067	368020	368020	He	243	“ I think a lot of things are possible . All I know for certain is that those goddamn photos were my salvation whether I like to think about them that way or not . ”
368068	368072	368073	368073	I	5148	“ They were , ”
368076	368123	368020	368020	He	243	“ And I still do n’t know who or why , which leads me to think that someone is playing with me . They ’ll reveal themselves eventually , and when they do , they ’re going to want something from me . Tit for tat . ”
368149	368161	368138	368138	I	5148	“ But how does that tie in with Sofia being missing ? ”
368179	368182	368183	368183	I	5148	“ Damien ? ”
368186	368194	368183	368183	I	5148	“ What are n’t you telling me ? ”
368203	368210	368197	368197	him	243	“ Richter abused her , too . ”
368230	368233	368234	368234	He	243	“ Oh . ”
368239	368279	368234	368234	He	243	“ If there are photos of me , there are undoubtedly photos of her . Someone delivered a set to me — through the court , but still to me . What if someone did the same to her ? ”
368311	368331	368304	368304	they	4678	“ But would n’t she call you ? Are n’t you the one she ’d turn to for help ? ”
368332	368454	368280	368280	I	5148	“ I do n’t know . Sofia is many things , but predictable is n’t one of them . She once disappeared for six months . Turned out she screwed some guy who did time making fake passports , and since I have n’t been able to find any evidence that she left the UK under her own name , I ca n’t help but wonder if she ’s hooked up with him again . She ’s smart and she ’s fearless . She ’s lived on the streets , so if she feels like she needs to hide , she can disappear better than anyone . Most important , she ’s fucked up enough to happily fall off the grid . ”
368455	368485	368486	368486	I	5148	“ I get that you love her , and I get that she ’s not entirely stable , and I get that you ’re worried . But , Damien , ”
368490	368509	368486	368486	I	5148	“ she ’s an adult . And no matter what your history , she ’s not your responsibility . ”
368510	368521	368486	368486	I	5148	“ Maybe not , but it feels like she is . ”
368885	368890	368891	368891	I	5148	“ Who is he ? ”
368903	368920	368921	368921	She	4690	“ That ’s Eli Jones . He won the Oscar for best supporting actor last year . ”
368926	368932	368921	368921	She	4690	“ You really are hopeless . ”
368933	368937	368938	368938	I	5148	“ I am , ”
368956	368976	368953	368953	I	5148	“ It ’s going to be hard to focus on your acting career if you move back to Texas . ”
368985	369013	368977	368977	She	4690	“ Yeah , well , we both know that it ’s a long - shot career . It ’s not like I ’ve taken LA by storm . ”
369100	369105	369106	369106	I	5148	“ Whatever you decide , ”
369110	369119	369106	369106	I	5148	“ You know I ’ve got your back . ”
369172	369181	369182	369182	Courtney	271	“ Hey , Courtney . What ’s up ? ”
369297	369335	369288	369288	she	271	“ Ollie and I want to know if you and Damien are free on Tuesday night . Jamie , too . Is she with you ? Ollie said she ’s staying with you and Damien this week ? ”
369391	369394	369395	369395	I	5148	“ Yeah , ”
369412	369423	369395	369395	I	5148	“ She ’s here . What ’s up on Tuesday ? ”
369424	369472	369395	369395	I	5148	“ Nothing specific . But I do n’t have any trips this week , and we have n’t seen y’ all in forever . I told Ollie that we should all go to Westerfield ’s . You know it , right ? That place in West Hollywood . ”
369473	369478	369479	369479	I	5148	“ I know it , ”
369492	369498	369395	369395	I	5148	“ So can you come ? ”
369540	369543	369544	369544	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
369548	369554	369544	369544	I	5148	“ We ’ll be there . ”
369771	369783	369763	369763	She	1450	“ What ? Like you do n’t know he ’s hot ? ”
369784	369788	369789	369789	I	5148	“ Trust me , ”
369802	369811	369789	369789	I	5148	“ I am fully aware of his hotness . ”
369812	369816	369817	369817	Jamie	1450	“ Making another ? ”
369827	369835	369789	369789	I	5148	“ Nope . Just eating the chocolate . ”
369836	369840	369789	369789	I	5148	“ You okay ? ”
369847	369860	369841	369841	I	5148	“ Chocolate is n’t always a sign of a deep emotional crisis . ”
369861	369869	369789	369789	I	5148	“ Good . Glad to hear it . ”
369879	369882	369870	369870	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
369883	369887	369888	369888	She	1450	“ No reason . ”
369901	369928	369929	369929	she	1450	“ Really . I was just wondering what was going on with the whole stalker thing . Not that I do n’t totally love it here , ”
369933	369945	369929	369929	she	1450	“ But , hey , I like being around my stuff . ”
369946	369951	369952	369952	I	5148	“ I get that , ”
369955	369973	369952	369952	I	5148	“ But I do n’t think Damien ’s security folks or the police have learned anything new . ”
369974	369981	369929	369929	she	1450	“ Must be driving Damien nuts . ”
369982	369986	369987	369987	I	5148	“ It is , ”
369990	369998	369987	369987	I	5148	“ That and trying to find Sofia . ”
369999	370002	369929	369929	she	1450	“ Who ? ”
370071	370078	370079	370079	Jamie	1450	“ And you ’re not jealous ? ”
370087	370095	370082	370082	I	5148	“ Are you saying I should be ? ”
370096	370121	370079	370079	Jamie	1450	“ Ex - girlfriend , and now he ’s obsessed with finding her again ? Shit , I ’d be pulling my hair out . ”
370122	370125	370126	370126	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
370130	370139	370126	370126	I	5148	“ I appreciate the mental health pep talk . ”
370140	370163	370079	370079	Jamie	1450	“ Yeah , well , as we ’ve established several times over , I ’m not anywhere near as together as you . ”
370164	370178	370179	370179	I	5148	“ I think you have me confused with someone who does n’t cut , ”
370198	370210	370184	370184	she	4710	“ I think you have you confused with someone who does . ”
370326	370329	370330	370330	she	4712	“ What ? ”
370398	370407	370381	370381	she	4712	“ Damn , but I do love chocolate . ”
370412	370448	370408	370408	I	5148	“ I ’m going to bed before I eat any more of that . Do you want me to wake you in the morning ? I ’m getting up early to go to the office . ”
370477	370488	370489	370489	she	4712	“ I ’ll disown you if you wake me up , ”
370492	370496	370497	370497	She	4712	“ Now go . ”
370503	370525	370497	370497	She	4712	“ If I ca n’t have sex , I ’m going to at least finish off the last of this chocolate . ”
370887	370890	370891	370891	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
370907	370928	370929	370929	I	5148	“ You did n’t talk to me that first day in Burbank because I was the new girl at Innovative , ”
370932	370942	370929	370929	I	5148	“ You did it because Damien asked you to . ”
370981	370988	370989	370989	Lisa	837	“ It was n’t like that , ”
370997	371009	370992	370992	I	5148	“ He did n’t ask you to reach out to me ? ”
371010	371015	371016	371016	she	837	“ Well , yes , ”
371019	371027	371016	371016	she	837	“ I guess it was like that . ”
371064	371117	371031	371031	her	837	“ He told me that you were considering going out on your own . That you already had some smartphone apps on the market that were doing well , and that you were working on developing some web - based apps that he thought would make a serious splash in the market . ”
371118	371121	371052	371052	I	5148	“ And ? ”
371122	371138	371031	371031	her	837	“ And he told me that you were unsure of yourself as a business owner . ”
371139	371158	371052	371052	I	5148	“ So he figured if I would n’t listen to him , maybe I ’d listen to you ? ”
371284	371290	371291	371291	Lisa	837	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
371294	371323	371291	371291	Lisa	837	“ He asked me not to tell you , but the truth is I did n’t even think about it after that first time we met in Burbank . ”
371327	371339	371324	371324	I	5148	“ Honestly , it ’s not you I ’m annoyed with . ”
371371	371400	371362	371365	the woman I thought	837	“ Come on , Nikki , you know how he feels about you . He was n’t trying to be underhanded — he only wanted to help you . ”
371401	371407	371408	371408	I	5148	“ Help drive me crazy , ”
371415	371421	371422	371422	Her	837	“ I really am sorry . ”
371428	371439	371422	371422	Her	837	“ So are we still on for happy hour sometime ? ”
371440	371443	371444	371444	I	5148	“ Sure , ”
371479	371501	371467	371467	I’m	5148	“ Actually , I ’m meeting some friends at Westerfield ’s tomorrow . Why do n’t you guys come , too ? ”
371502	371507	371551	371551	she	837	“ Are you sure ? ”
371508	371511	371512	371512	I	5148	“ Absolutely , ”
371516	371522	371523	371523	Lisa	837	“ I ’d like that , ”
371526	371532	371523	371523	Lisa	837	“ Text me the details ? ”
371533	371537	371538	371538	I	5148	“ Will do , ”
371541	371550	371551	371551	she	837	“ And do n’t kick Damien too hard , ”
371845	371852	371853	371853	I	5148	“ How ’d the audition go ? ”
371950	371960	371961	371961	I	5148	“ You must be bored out of your mind , ”
371964	371972	371961	371961	I	5148	“ But I really do appreciate it . ”
372060	372091	372055	372055	she	2551	“ It ’s so much easier to pick a color if you have an actual patch on the wall . Those cardboard paint chips will only get you so far . ”
372092	372106	372107	372107	I	5148	“ No , it ’s okay , really . I like the blue , ”
372124	372132	372133	372133	she	2551	“ One of my favorites as well , ”
372142	372188	372136	372136	She	2551	“ I know you have work , so let me finish putting some of these colors up , and then I ’ll come back tomorrow with a few canvases for you to choose from , and you can tell me which colors sing to you . ”
372305	372317	372318	372318	she	2551	“ Not that I would n’t rather be shooting a commercial , ”
372321	372333	372318	372318	she	2551	“ But I ’m all about the glass being half full . ”
372337	372347	372348	372348	I	5148	“ Glad to hear it . And , James , ”
372351	372368	372348	372348	I	5148	“ just because the beach is private does n’t mean it ’s private , you know ? ”
372369	372375	372318	372318	she	2551	“ No naked body surfing ? ”
372376	372381	372382	372382	I	5148	“ Not even topless , ”
372387	372409	372382	372382	I	5148	“ Tell your man that I ’ll fix dinner tonight . We can call it rent . What do you want ? ”
372410	372417	372418	372418	I	5148	“ I ’m good with anything , ”
372421	372439	372440	372440	I	5148	“ And if you need to go to the store , just get Edward to drive you . ”
372498	372503	372504	372504	I	5148	“ My friend Jamie , ”
372520	372530	372515	372515	she	2551	“ She ’s vegging at the Malibu house today . ”
372531	372535	372515	372515	she	2551	“ Sounds nice . ”
372549	372552	372553	372553	I	5148	“ Maybe , ”
372556	372564	372553	372553	I	5148	“ But this is good , too . ”
372565	372572	372573	372573	Giselle	2551	“ I ’m excited for you , ”
372576	372592	372573	372573	Giselle	2551	“ And impressed by how quickly you ’re working to get your name out there . ”
372598	372607	372608	372608	she	2551	“ The article in today ’s Business Journal , ”
372624	372660	372608	372608	she	2551	“ About the app you ’re designing for Blaine . I think it ’s great that you ’re turning all that nasty press about the portrait around and using it to promote your new business . ”
372661	372669	372670	372670	I	5148	“ I did n’t contact the Journal , ”
372673	372676	372677	372677	She	2551	“ Oh . ”
372680	372697	372677	372677	She	2551	“ I guess Evelyn or Blaine must have . Either way , it ’s great publicity . ”
373019	373025	373014	373014	he	225	“ Can I come in ? ”
373079	373084	373085	373085	I	5148	“ For a bit , ”
373088	373095	373085	373085	I	5148	“ I have work to do . ”
373162	373167	373168	373168	he	225	“ I ’m sorry , ”
373191	373260	373171	373171	I	5148	“ You are a brilliant man , Damien Stark . Which is why I do n’t understand why you ca n’t get it through your head that this kind of thing pisses me off . It ’s one thing — one very annoying thing — to ask Lisa to seek me out and help me . It ’s another thing to lie to me about checking her credentials . ”
373261	373268	373269	373269	he	225	“ I have checked her credentials , ”
373272	373280	373269	373269	he	225	“ It ’s just been a while . ”
373281	373288	373171	373171	I	5148	“ You know what I mean . ”
373289	373293	373294	373294	he	225	“ I do , ”
373312	373326	373308	373308	I	5148	“ Dammit , Damien . You ca n’t just pull shit like that . ”
373327	373340	373171	373171	I	5148	“ Are you going to ignore her advice ? Cut her off ? ”
373341	373352	373353	373353	I	5148	“ No . She ’s my friend . Despite you , ”
373356	373384	373353	373353	I	5148	“ Not because of you . And do n’t you dare argue that what you did makes no difference because we ended up genuinely liking each other . ”
373385	373391	373392	373392	he	225	“ I know the difference , ”
373396	373410	373392	373392	he	225	“ But I have a blind spot where you ’re concerned , Nikki . ”
373411	373421	373422	373422	I	5148	“ Aw , really ? That ’s so romantic . ”
373430	373435	373422	373422	I	5148	“ Get over it . ”
373537	373543	373544	373544	I	5148	“ You can fuck me , ”
373548	373558	373544	373544	I	5148	“ But I ’ll still be mad at you . ”
373576	373579	373580	373580	he	225	“ Tempting , ”
373602	373606	373584	373584	he	225	“ For you . ”
373681	373684	373685	373685	I	5148	“ Okay , ”
373691	373706	373707	373707	I	5148	“ You ’re officially out of the doghouse . Thank you for the cookies , ”
373710	373718	373707	373707	I	5148	“ And do n’t do it again . ”
373719	373726	373727	373727	he	225	“ I ’ll do my best , ”
373730	373740	373727	373727	he	225	“ But it ’s safer not to make promises . ”
373818	373823	373824	373824	I	5148	“ Thanks for coming , ”
373827	373838	373824	373824	I	5148	“ You could have waited and talked to me tonight . ”
373839	373842	373843	373843	he	225	“ No , ”
373847	373853	373843	373843	he	225	“ I could n’t have . ”
373854	373857	373824	373824	I	5148	“ Lunch ? ”
373858	373869	373843	373843	he	225	“ Unfortunately , that I do have to pass on . ”
373870	373904	373824	373824	I	5148	“ Too bad , though I suppose it ’s just as well . I ’ve accomplished absolutely zip today . I take it your day is busier what with a universe to run . ”
373905	373917	373843	373843	he	225	“ My universe today extends only to the two of us . ”
373952	373964	373938	373938	I	5148	“ You ’ve learned something . Is it good or bad ? ”
373965	373973	373843	373843	he	225	“ A bit of both , actually . ”
373974	373984	373938	373938	I	5148	“ All right . Tell me the good first . ”
373985	373997	373843	373843	he	225	“ The court ruled against the motion to unseal the photos . ”
373998	374001	374002	374002	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
374005	374010	374002	374002	I	5148	“ That ’s huge . ”
374011	374015	374016	374016	he	225	“ It is , ”
374019	374060	374016	374016	he	225	“ But the press is n’t stupid . The odds are they ’ll try the back - door route and do the same thing I ’m doing — try to figure out who sent the evidence in the first place . ”
374061	374068	373843	373843	he	225	“ Have you learned anything new ? ”
374075	374100	374069	374069	He	225	“ About the photos , no . About our leak regarding your portrait , yes . Turns out the ATM camera was very effective . ”
374101	374112	374016	374016	he	225	“ Seriously ? That ’s wonderful . Who is it ? ”
374113	374119	374120	374120	he	225	“ I still need confirmation , ”
374123	374143	374120	374120	he	225	“ Let me see where it goes , and then I ’ll lay the whole thing out for you . ”
374144	374147	374148	374148	I	5148	“ Okay , ”
374235	374250	374217	374217	I	5148	“ Ms. Fairchild , you have another delivery . May I send them back ? ”
374251	374254	374255	374255	I	5148	“ Sure . ”
374267	374278	374261	374261	he	225	“ This one ’s not from me . I swear . ”
374305	374311	374312	374312	he	225	“ Let me open it , ”
374335	374341	374312	374312	he	225	“ You do n’t think … ”
374342	374348	374349	374349	He	225	“ I do n’t know . ”
374354	374363	374349	374349	He	225	“ But I ’m going to find out . ”
374437	374440	374441	374441	I	5148	“ No , ”
374445	374454	374441	374441	I	5148	“ I want to see when you do . ”
374712	374715	374703	374703	I	5148	“ Nikki ! ”
374716	374719	374699	374699	Nikki	5143	“ Damien . ”
374741	374744	374745	374745	he	5148	“ Sorry , ”
374756	374760	374745	374745	he	5148	“ You fainted . ”
374761	374766	374767	374767	I	5148	“ I — what ? ”
374791	374794	374786	374786	I	5148	“ Fainted ? ”
374842	374847	374848	374848	Damien	5148	“ You had reason , ”
374979	374983	374984	374984	I	5148	“ My mother , ”
374987	374998	374984	374984	I	5148	“ Whoever is doing this got these from my mother . ”
375023	375027	375028	375028	he	5148	“ Your mother ? ”
375031	375038	375028	375028	he	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
375048	375053	375054	375054	Damien	5148	“ This is good , ”
375070	375076	375077	375077	he	5148	“ It ’s solid information , ”
375086	375117	375077	375077	he	5148	“ A definitive connection . I ’m going to have Ryan speak with your mother . I think he ’ll have better luck getting her to cooperate than I will . ”
375137	375140	375126	375126	I	5148	“ Where — ”
375141	375147	375148	375148	His	5148	“ I put them away . ”
375196	375199	375200	375200	I	5148	“ I — ”
375256	375260	375261	375261	he	5148	“ Tell me , ”
375265	375272	375261	375261	he	5148	“ Tell me what you need . ”
375281	375285	375286	375286	I	5148	“ You know , ”
375293	375299	375300	375300	He	5148	“ I do , baby . ”
375325	375333	375334	375334	His	5148	“ You want me to touch you . ”
375350	375380	375334	375334	His	5148	“ You want me to fuck you . You want to feel the sting of my hand against your ass or the burn of a rope around your wrist . ”
375406	375422	375423	375423	His	5148	“ You want to draw in the pain — to turn it around inside you . ”
375817	375871	375872	375872	He	5148	“ You want the pain because it ’s what gives you the power to beat it — to haul yourself back and say fuck you to the world . It ’s a gift , Nikki — that red - hot sting . And I will be the one to give it to you . ”
376010	376017	376018	376018	he	5148	“ Is this what you want ? ”
376078	376105	376064	376064	He	5148	“ You ’ll have my hand , too , because I ca n’t bear not to touch you . But if this is what you need — ”
376198	376205	376206	376206	he	5148	“ Is that what you needed ? ”
376250	376269	376270	376270	His	5148	“ Do you need more ? Tell me , Nikki . I want to hear what you need . ”
376299	376302	376303	376303	I	5148	“ You , ”
376336	376361	376315	376315	I	5148	“ Inside me now . Like this . Right here on my desk . And hard . Please , Damien , fuck me hard . ”
376362	376367	376368	376368	He	5148	“ Oh , baby . ”
376661	376691	376646	376646	he	5148	“ I need you , Damien — God , I need you in ways that you understand better than I do . But I feel so selfish . So — ”
376703	376718	376692	376692	He	5148	“ Are you under the impression that I do n’t need you , Nikki ? ”
376719	376727	376728	376728	I	5148	“ I — no . But I — ”
376863	376887	376855	376855	He	5148	“ Do you remember what I told you in Munich ? About not wanting to touch you with those images in my head . ”
376901	376905	376897	376897	I	5148	“ Of course . ”
376906	376913	376897	376897	I	5148	“ I was n’t entirely accurate . ”
376914	376917	376897	376897	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
376932	376961	376962	376962	He	5148	“ Pictures or not — those memories are always there . I ca n’t shake them . I ’ve never shaken them . But you make them tolerable . ”
376982	377051	376962	376962	He	5148	“ You ’re what gives me strength . If I am what centers you , Nikki , then you are what anchors me . Every time I touch you , every time I bury myself deep inside you — Nikki , do n’t you see ? You are the talisman of my life , and if I lose my grip on you , then I have lost myself . ”
377052	377055	377056	377056	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
377404	377418	377390	377390	he	4780	“ Ms. Fairchild , this one does n’t have a drive - through . ”
377419	377432	377446	377446	he	4780	“ Just park in front . I wo n’t be five minutes . ”
377465	377482	377455	377455	I	5148	“ Do you really think someone is lying in wait in the coffee shop for me ? ”
377483	377512	377455	377455	I	5148	“ I think that anyone willing to call your mother for photographs is willing to study you , learn your habits , and be very , very patient . ”
377574	377601	377568	377568	She	692	“ I was hoping I ’d see you today . I wanted to tell you to ignore them . They ’re just money - grubbing pricks . ”
377633	377636	377637	377637	I	5148	“ What ? ”
377648	377665	377666	377666	Monica	692	“ You have n’t seen ? It was on one of those gossip sites this morning , ”
377669	377679	377666	377666	Monica	692	“ It ’s probably been tweeted all over creation . ”
377680	377684	377685	377685	I	5148	“ What has ? ”
377718	377734	377705	377705	He	366	“ Mr. Stark thought it would be better not to bother you with this today . ”
377735	377740	377741	377741	I	5148	“ Oh , really ? ”
378029	378032	378033	378033	I	5148	“ That , ”
378044	378072	378033	378033	I	5148	“ is a load of crap . But Jamie ’s going to be pleased . They said she was up - and - coming , after all . ”
378073	378080	378081	378081	Monica	692	“ So you ’re not pissed ? ”
378089	378121	378084	378084	I	5148	“ Irritated . I ’m sick to death of my personal life being twisted around in the press . But the story itself ? It ’s such bullshit it ’s funny . ”
378122	378130	378131	378131	Monica	692	“ Well , I ’m totally relieved , ”
378134	378158	378159	378159	she	692	“ I mean , I figured it was all crap , but it got to me anyway . I had a bad breakup , ”
378162	378167	378159	378159	she	692	“ I ’m sorry . ”
378168	378193	378194	378194	she	692	“ We were hot and heavy for a long time , and then he decided he was in love with someone else . Men , ”
378206	378212	378213	378213	I	5148	“ That must have hurt . ”
378236	378241	378242	378242	she	692	“ Oh , yeah , ”
378245	378265	378266	378266	she	692	“ It was like someone took a knife and sliced my heart to bits . But I ’m okay , ”
378272	378305	378266	378266	she	692	“ What we had was really special . And that girl ? She ’s just a fling . Temporary . He ’s going to come back to me . I know it . ”
378323	378331	378317	378317	I	5148	“ I really hope you ’re right . ”
378347	378362	378363	378363	he	366	“ I ’ll bring the limo around as soon as we have you inside , ”
378469	378485	378487	378487	I	5148	“ No problem . I ’m going to skip out in a few hours anyway . ”
378535	378540	378541	378541	I	5148	“ Is everything okay ? ”
378545	378551	378552	378552	she	2551	“ Could n’t be better , ”
378555	378567	378552	378552	she	2551	“ A client coming in . One of my best ones . ”
378568	378591	378599	378599	she	2551	“ Better be careful who you say that to . Damien wo n’t be keen on getting knocked from the top slot . ”
378604	378638	378599	378599	she	2551	“ To be honest , Damien is the client . But promise me you wo n’t say a word . I have a feeling he wants to buy a canvas for your office . ”
378644	378653	378639	378639	I	5148	“ Really ? I promise to be surprised . ”
378662	378665	378666	378666	I	5148	“ Hey , ”
378669	378706	378666	378666	I	5148	“ I was just about to head back to Malibu to get ready for tonight . Are we going to grab something out for dinner , or do you want me to bribe Jamie to cook ? ”
378707	378731	378654	378654	I	5148	“ Why do n’t you two pick your favorite restaurant — my treat — and I ’ll meet you at the club later . ”
378732	378735	378666	378666	I	5148	“ Work ? ”
378736	378749	378654	378654	I	5148	“ A meeting . I have a feeling it ’ll run long . ”
378750	378773	378666	378666	I	5148	“ Oh ? Where will you be ? We could have Edward swing by and pick you up when you ’re done . ”
378788	378794	378795	378795	he	5148	“ You girls have fun , ”
378799	378818	378819	378819	he	5148	“ But not too much fun . Not until I get there , anyway . And , Nikki , ”
378822	378850	378819	378819	he	5148	“ I ’ve already spoken to my manager about security at the club , so they ’re stepping it up a notch . You ’ll be watched . ”
378851	378855	378856	378856	I	5148	“ All right , ”
378865	378885	378819	378819	he	5148	“ And I ’m sending Ryan to the club . I want him with you until I get there . ”
378892	378912	378887	378887	I	5148	“ Poor guy . He probably used to have a life before he had to start chasing my monsters . ”
378913	378926	378927	378927	Damien	5148	“ There ’s nothing he likes better than taking down a monster , ”
378930	378959	378927	378927	Damien	5148	“ And the fact that I pay him so well makes it even more fun . Trust me , you do n’t have to feel sorry for Ryan . ”
378963	378975	378960	378960	I	5148	“ Okay , then . But , Damien ? Please hurry . ”
379175	379182	379183	379184	the bouncer	1285	“ Looking good , Ms. Fairchild , ”
379192	379200	379183	379184	the bouncer	1285	“ Knock ’em dead , Ms. Archer . ”
379201	379209	379210	379210	Jamie	1450	“ This is why I love Damien , ”
379220	379232	379210	379210	Jamie	1450	“ He hires staff that know how to properly suck up . ”
379325	379328	379329	379329	she	4814	“ What ? ”
379332	379341	379342	379342	I	5148	“ That ’s what I wanted to ask . ”
379393	379403	379404	379404	I	5148	“ Tell me you did n’t sleep with him , ”
379415	379420	379421	379421	she	4814	“ Swear to God , ”
379424	379440	379421	379421	she	4814	“ We talked . And he ’s a total gentleman . I made him eggs . ”
379441	379445	379404	379404	I	5148	“ You what ? ”
379451	379502	379503	379503	she	4814	“ He came out in a hurry because of that shit with you and the photos . And he had n’t eaten . So I made him eggs . And he said he really liked them . Next time , I might try to make him a waffle . What ? ”
379532	379535	379536	379536	I	5148	“ Nothing , ”
379539	379549	379536	379536	I	5148	“ Just — I’m glad he likes your eggs . ”
379550	379559	379560	379560	She	4814	“ Hey . What ’s not to like ? ”
379705	379710	379711	379711	Jamie	1450	“ What is it ? ”
379725	379737	379720	379720	I	5148	“ I ’m not sure . I ’ll tell you later . ”
379862	379867	379874	379874	her	837	“ Hey , Courtney ! ”
379918	379923	379924	379924	Ollie	837	“ Listen , Nik , ”
379942	379947	379924	379924	Ollie	837	“ Can we talk ? ”
379986	380009	379974	379974	He	5148	“ I just wanted to say I ’m sorry . About the grief I ’ve given you about Stark , I mean . ”
380037	380054	380030	380030	He	5148	“ I know about the photos , Nik . Nobody should have that in his past . ”
380068	380076	380063	380063	I	5148	“ He does n’t want your pity . ”
380077	380125	380030	380030	He	5148	“ And he does n’t have it . I ’m just — I do n’t know . I guess I ’m just saying that I know what kind of shit you went through as a kid , and now I know what he has to live with . ”
380142	380187	380063	380063	I	5148	“ Stark ’s not ever going to be on my favorite - people list , but I ’ve seen the way you two are together , and I really got to see it in Germany . I think you ’re good for each other . ”
380206	380210	380188	380188	I	5148	“ We are . ”
380216	380249	380211	380211	His	4824	“ So that ’s it . That ’s my apology . I wo n’t say that I ’ll be asking the guy out for drinks and male bonding , but , well — ”
380259	380262	380263	380263	I	5148	“ Thanks , ”
380266	380273	380291	380291	He	4824	“ Wanna go get a drink ? ”
380274	380277	380278	380278	I	5148	“ No , ”
380281	380290	380278	380278	I	5148	“ Stay and dance with me some more . ”
380480	380489	380490	380490	I	5148	“ What happened to the destination bridal shower ? ”
380522	380531	380532	380532	she	271	“ I think it ’s off the agenda , ”
380535	380538	380539	380539	I	5148	“ Why ? ”
380582	380591	380592	380592	Courtney	271	“ I should hate her , you know , ”
380606	380614	380615	380615	I	5148	“ What are you saying , Courtney ? ”
380634	380643	380644	380644	she	271	“ I ’m not going to marry him , ”
380647	380707	380644	380644	she	271	“ I do n’t want to be that woman whose husband cheats on her , and I do n’t want to get married because I ’m a good choice . I ca n’t do that to myself . Hell , I ca n’t do that to him . We ’d be miserable in a year and divorced in two . ”
380708	380711	380712	380712	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
380801	380808	380790	380790	she	271	“ When are you telling him ? ”
380809	380824	380825	380825	She	271	“ Soon . Maybe tonight . I just need to get up the courage . ”
380828	380843	380844	380844	She	271	“ It ’s not that I do n’t love him . It ’s just … ”
380860	380865	380866	380866	I	5148	“ Do n’t worry , ”
380873	380880	380866	380866	I	5148	“ Believe me , I know . ”
381061	381068	381047	381047	I	5148	“ I want you . Now . ”
381176	381183	381166	381166	he	837	“ Damien ? What is it ? ”
381715	381727	381704	381704	I	5148	“ Do you want to tell me what that was about ? ”
381750	381758	381732	381732	He	837	“ Nobody fucks with what is mine . ”
381765	381774	381759	381759	I	5148	“ What ’s yours ? You mean me ? ”
381795	381799	381775	381775	He	837	“ What happened ? ”
381800	381818	381775	381775	He	837	“ I paid a visit to Giselle earlier . You wo n’t be working with her again . ”
381828	381833	381819	381819	His	837	“ What the fuck ? ”
381840	381857	381819	381819	His	837	“ Goddammit , Damien , quit talking in riddles and tell me what ’s going on . ”
381889	381952	381873	381873	I	5148	“ She was in the ATM footage . I confronted her , and she confessed she leaked the story about the portrait so she could get cash to help keep her business going after she and Bruce split . She also sold the story about Jamie and the Ferrari , not to mention the bullshit about our little love nest in Malibu . ”
381953	381958	381962	381962	I	5148	“ What ? No . ”
382031	382048	381993	381993	she	4846	“ But she ’s the one who told me about the article in the Business Journal . ”
382049	382052	382053	382053	he	5148	“ Camouflage , ”
382056	382077	382053	382053	he	5148	“ She sells the story , then tells you . You ’re both surprised together , and she looks innocent . ”
382083	382115	382053	382053	he	5148	“ Wait a second . You fired her ? She was doing my walls in my office . If anyone was going to fire her , it should have been me . ”
382116	382121	382122	382122	he	5148	“ I told you , ”
382125	382134	382122	382122	he	5148	“ No one fucks with what ’s mine . ”
382261	382266	382267	382267	he	5148	“ It ’s done , ”
382270	382275	382267	382267	he	5148	“ It ’s over . ”
382276	382282	382267	382267	he	5148	“ How is it done ? ”
382283	382349	382267	382267	he	5148	“ I explained to her that my lawyers were more than capable of dragging out multiple actions for defamation and invasion of privacy . She ’s a businesswoman at heart , so she understands that I can keep a litigation going forever , but she ’s going to have trouble finding a lawyer whose hourly rate does n’t break her . We came to terms . ”
382350	382356	382267	382267	he	5148	“ What kind of terms ? ”
382357	382385	382267	382267	he	5148	“ She turned over all right , title , and interest in her galleries to me . She ’s relocating to Florida . And good fucking riddance . ”
382406	382418	382386	382386	I	5148	“ You do n’t have to fight my battles , Damien . ”
382419	382433	382434	382434	His	4851	“ I love you , Nikki . I will always fight for you . ”
382454	382459	382460	382460	I	5148	“ You love me , ”
382472	382475	382467	382467	his	4851	“ Desperately . ”
382490	382497	382498	382498	I	5148	“ You have n’t said it , ”
382501	382507	382498	382498	I	5148	“ Not for weeks now . ”
382580	382587	382588	382588	he	4851	“ I love you , Nikki , ”
382591	382622	382588	382588	he	4851	“ I say it with every touch , with every look , with every breath that I take . I love you . I love you so much it hurts . ”
382623	382628	382629	382629	I	5148	“ Me , too . ”
382642	382711	382629	382629	I	5148	“ But you ca n’t protect me from everything , Damien . And you sure as hell ca n’t protect me by keeping things from me . You should have told me about Giselle . Hell , who knows what else is out there you ’re keeping from me . So just stop it , okay ? It does n’t protect me , it just pisses me off . ”
382712	382716	382717	382717	he	4851	“ All right , ”
382735	382741	382732	382732	he	4851	“ Sofia sent the photos . ”
382762	382797	382798	382798	He	4851	“ The photos in Germany . Sofia is the one who sent them to the court ? I do n’t understand . Why ? How do you know ? Did you talk to her ? ”
382841	382888	382889	382889	I	5148	“ I discovered a discrepancy in one of my father ’s accounts . Small amounts siphoned off to an account that I do n’t have access to . In excess of a hundred thousand dollars , and yesterday I learned that money was filtered to Sofia . ”
382932	382943	382910	382910	I	5148	“ Why would your father send Sofia that much money ? ”
382944	382950	382951	382951	he	5148	“ Payment for her testimony , ”
382954	383023	382951	382951	he	5148	“ He wanted her to testify about the abuse — same reason you wanted me to testify . But he did n’t know about the photos . She must have found them in Richter ’s things . She took those , sent them to the court , waited around just long enough to make sure it worked , and then used the money to skip out of Europe . ”
383024	383033	382910	382910	I	5148	“ How do you know all of this ? ”
383034	383056	382951	382951	he	5148	“ After I learned about the skimmed money , I had another talk with dear old Dad . He told me . ”
383057	383063	382910	382910	I	5148	“ And you believe him ? ”
383064	383068	382951	382951	he	5148	“ I do . ”
383080	383089	383069	383069	I	5148	“ Does he know where she is now ? ”
383090	383133	382910	382910	I	5148	“ He says no , and before you ask , I believe him about that , too . Sofia was never fond of my father . I can see her taking his money . I ca n’t see her staying in touch . ”
383134	383138	383139	383139	I	5148	“ All right , ”
383143	383180	383139	383139	I	5148	“ I understand that you ’re still worried about her , but this means that you can stop worrying that the pictures will turn up in the tabloids . Sofia wo n’t release them , right ? ”
383181	383184	383185	383185	he	5148	“ No , ”
383195	383213	383185	383185	he	5148	“ I ’m certain that she wo n’t ever let anyone get their hands on those images . ”
383214	383221	383222	383222	I	5148	“ So this is good news , ”
383225	383238	383222	383222	I	5148	“ You ’ll find her eventually — doesn’t she always show up ? ”
383239	383308	383185	383185	he	5148	“ She does , and I may have a lead on her already . I tracked down David and his band . They just arrived in Chicago from Shanghai . I spoke to David on the phone . He tells me he has n’t seen Sofia , but I do n’t believe him . I think a face - to - face conference might help jog his memory . ”
383309	383315	383222	383222	I	5148	“ When are you leaving ? ”
383316	383320	383321	383321	he	4855	“ Tomorrow morning , ”
383342	383350	383324	383324	He	4855	“ How long will you be gone ? ”
383351	383364	383394	383394	she	4858	“ If I ’m lucky ? I ’ll be back by dinner . ”
383365	383373	383324	383324	He	4855	“ And if you ’re not lucky ? ”
383374	383381	383394	383394	she	4858	“ Let ’s hope I am . ”
383594	383602	383588	383588	her	692	“ I ’m so proud of you ! ”
383603	383622	383623	383623	I	5148	“ If Damien ’s not back from Chicago by tonight , do you want to rent a movie ? ”
383633	383636	383637	383637	she	692	“ Sure , ”
383640	383647	383637	383637	she	692	“ And if he is back ? ”
383652	383662	383648	383648	I	5148	“ In that case , I have other plans . ”
383793	383796	383797	383797	I	5148	“ Yes ? ”
383800	383811	383797	383797	I	5148	“ There ’s a Monica Karts here to see you . ”
383812	383815	383816	383816	I	5148	“ Oh . ”
383890	383898	383878	383878	I	5148	“ Tell her to come on back . ”
383899	383904	383905	383905	she	692	“ I love it ! ”
383914	383924	383905	383905	she	692	“ Your own office . That ’s so cool . ”
383925	383935	383878	383878	I	5148	“ What ’s going on ? Is everything okay ? ”
383936	383990	383905	383905	she	692	“ Oh , man . I do n’t mean to just barge in like you ’ve got nothing better to do . Honest . But I got these head shots and I did n’t see you at Starbucks this morning , and I really wanted to show you today . Is that okay ? ”
384003	384007	383998	383998	Her	692	“ Of course . ”
384024	384032	384008	384008	She	692	“ Go ahead . Take a peek . ”
384113	384137	384138	384138	My	5148	“ Gorgeous , is n’t he ? But I suppose you know that . Go on , then . Pull them all out . ”
384354	384362	384363	384363	Her	651	“ I said pull them all out . ”
384420	384437	384404	384404	she	651	“ There ’s a tape , too . But we wo n’t worry about that now . ”
384483	384488	384489	384489	she	651	“ He ’s mine , ”
384492	384499	384489	384489	she	651	“ He has always been mine . ”
384500	384503	384504	384504	I	5148	“ Yours , ”
384517	384522	384504	384504	I	5148	“ You ’re Sofia . ”
384533	384537	384523	384523	She	651	“ Very good . ”
384538	384547	384523	384523	She	651	“ And this is you in these photos ? ”
384644	384652	384653	384653	I	5148	“ Why are you showing me these ? ”
384656	384689	384703	384703	She	744	“ Because you need to understand that he ’s mine . You do n’t exist to him at all . Not really . He sacrificed for me . He killed for me . ”
384697	384702	384690	384690	I	5148	“ Killed for you ? ”
384710	384714	384715	384715	she	744	“ My father , ”
384719	384756	384703	384703	She	744	“ Damien killed him to protect me . Ask him if you do n’t believe me . That ’s not something you walk away from , Nikki . You ’re smart . You should know that . ”
384757	384779	384703	384703	She	744	“ How did you get the first note to me ? The one before the trial with the Los Angeles postmark ? ”
384789	384821	384780	384780	Her	744	“ See ? I knew you were smart . I have friends all over the world . I sent something . Asked them to drop it in a mailbox . Easy . ”
384822	384838	384703	384703	She	744	“ That spiel you made about Jamie and The Rooftop bar . Was it true ? ”
384839	384876	384888	384888	she	744	“ Other than that I ’m one hell of an actress ? No . You learn to be patient in the kind of places I ’ve lived . I wait and I watch and I plan . ”
384892	384902	384888	384888	she	744	“ He told me about you , you know . ”
384948	384955	384956	384956	she	744	“ Oh , yes he did , ”
384963	385023	384956	384956	she	744	“ He came to see me not long ago . All the way to London . He told me he met someone who got through the pain . Who cut and who battled it back . He did n’t tell me he was fucking her or that it was you , but it was n’t hard to figure out . ”
385073	385146	385147	385147	She	744	“ I ’d already seen you in the tabloids by then , of course , and I was so pissed at him . Another girl in his bed , I ’d thought . Another girl , but the one he really wanted was me . Then he told me about the cutting , and that ’s when I realized the truth . This time he had a reason for fucking some woman . ”
385157	385195	385196	385196	She	744	“ He was holding you up as an example for me . He thinks I ’m all scarred because of what my daddy did , but he ’s wrong . I know how to turn it around . ”
385199	385269	385196	385196	She	744	“ But that ’s all you are to him , you know . Just a stone on the path of my journey . An object lesson for me to follow so that I can get my shit together and be with him . He loves me . He has always loved me . And I was there first . So now you need to move out of the way . ”
385302	385312	385313	385313	I	5148	“ You want me to break up with Damien . ”
385373	385376	385377	385377	she	744	“ No , ”
385380	385442	385377	385377	she	744	“ You want to break up with Damien . Because you know that if you do n’t , what I ’ll release to the press will destroy him . And is n’t that what love is all about , Nikki ? Is n’t it about protecting the ones you love ? Just like the way Damien protected me from my father . ”
385455	385463	385556	385556	She	744	“ You would n’t release those photos . ”
385467	385487	385464	385464	She	744	“ Why not ? It ’s not like anyone can tell it ’s me . Only Damien is identifiable . ”
385488	385492	385493	385493	I	5148	“ Why not ? ”
385496	385515	385493	385493	I	5148	“ Because you ’re sitting here telling me you love him . But that would absolutely destroy him . ”
385521	385555	385516	385516	She	744	“ You ’re destroying him . You ’re keeping him from me . If you do n’t let go , I do n’t have a choice . How can you not see that ? ”
385566	385578	385579	385579	She	744	“ Well , I guess that about wraps things up here . ”
385594	385613	385614	385614	She	744	“ You can keep those . Like a souvenir . And , oh , I forgot about this . ”
385627	385649	385614	385614	She	744	“ I get that this situation is hard on you , I really do . So I thought this might help . ”
385671	385716	385720	385720	she	744	“ And do n’t even think about calling your security guy . Those friends I mentioned ? I told them to release the photos to the press if I did n’t show up or if I got arrested or any silly shit like that . ”
385725	385736	385720	385720	she	744	“ Nothing personal . I just like to be thorough . ”
386388	386390	386397	386398	The scalpel	4888	“ No ”
386619	386635	386614	386614	Joe	305	“ Ms. Fairchild , are you okay ? You look a little under the weather . ”
387164	387169	387170	387170	he	5148	“ Well , hello , ”
387179	387188	387170	387170	he	5148	“ Apparently I ’m getting two presents today . ”
387283	387288	387289	387289	he	5148	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
387312	387317	387308	387308	his	5148	“ Is something wrong ? ”
387318	387323	387324	387324	I	5148	“ How was Chicago ? ”
387331	387334	387335	387335	He	5148	“ Productive . ”
387347	387384	387385	387385	He	5148	“ I was able to convince David to talk to me — he agrees that Sofia does n’t need to be out on her own . She has too many issues , and without her meds … ”
387407	387446	387389	387389	I	5148	“ David let her crash at his apartment here in LA . She ’s not there now — I checked — but I know what name she ’s using , so it ’s just a matter of time . ”
387447	387453	387454	387454	I	5148	“ What ’s the name ? ”
387457	387468	387469	387469	he	5148	“ Monica Karts . The last name is an anagram , ”
387472	387488	387389	387389	I	5148	“ I know . It took me a moment , but I figured that out . ”
387489	387498	387389	387389	I	5148	“ A moment ? I just told you . ”
387499	387502	387503	387503	I	5148	“ No , ”
387506	387534	387503	387503	I	5148	“ She told me . I ’ve known her for a while now . Just casually . Someone to chat with at the Starbucks near my office . ”
387552	387589	387542	387542	I	5148	“ Wait . I need to say something , and I need to do it fast . It ’s why I came by , so please — please just let me get this out , okay ? ”
387761	387769	387770	387770	I	5148	“ I ca n’t do this anymore , ”
387776	387793	387770	387770	I	5148	“ I ca n’t live with the secrets and the half - truths and the obfuscation . ”
387818	387825	387815	387815	he	5148	“ What are you talking about ? ”
387826	387869	387870	387870	I	5148	“ Sofia . She was in those photos and you did n’t tell me . Richter abused both of you together and you did n’t tell me . And you did kill Richter , Damien . You killed him to protect her . ”
387890	387901	387902	387902	he	5148	“ Everything I told you about that night was true , ”
387923	387936	387905	387905	I	5148	“ All I did was leave out the reason for the fight . ”
387937	387940	387911	387911	he	5148	“ Sofia . ”
387941	387951	387905	387905	I	5148	“ He was going to start whoring her out . ”
387960	387975	387905	387905	I	5148	“ The son of a bitch was going to whore out his own daughter . ”
387976	387980	387981	387981	I	5148	“ I see . ”
387991	388002	387981	387981	I	5148	“ But that doesn’t — that does n’t change anything . ”
388044	388061	388062	388062	I	5148	“ I meant what I said . I can’t — I ca n’t do this anymore . ”
388105	388120	388121	388121	I	5148	“ I ca n’t live knowing that there are more and more secrets underneath , ”
388128	388142	388121	388121	I	5148	“ I ca n’t go on pretending the shadows do n’t bother me . ”
388143	388146	388147	388147	His	5148	“ Nikki . ”
388229	388240	388220	388220	I	5148	“ I need to go . I — I’m sorry . ”
388272	388281	388258	388258	He	5148	“ Dammit , Damien , let me go . ”
388282	388291	388258	388258	He	5148	“ We are going to talk about this . ”
388336	388373	388319	388319	his	5148	“ There ’s nothing to talk about . Everything is a secret with you . Everything is a challenge . Everything is a game . This stuff about Sofia . That crap you pulled with Lisa . ”
388450	388493	388494	388494	His	4914	“ Goddammit , Nikki , do not come in here and dump this on me and expect me to shrug it off and be done with you . I love you . I am not letting you walk out of this room . ”
388525	388532	388533	388533	I	5148	“ I love you , too , ”
388554	388562	388533	388533	I	5148	“ But sometimes love is n’t enough . ”
388947	388954	388955	388955	Jamie	1450	“ You need to get out , ”
388987	388998	388983	388983	Damien	5148	“ Just to the corner . Just for a drink . ”
389004	389015	388999	388999	I	5148	“ Dammit , Nicholas , I ’m worried about you . ”
389062	389071	389072	389072	I	5148	“ I ’m worried about me , too , ”
389075	389080	389089	389089	she	4920	“ Jesus , Nik . ”
389099	389121	389089	389089	she	4920	“ You ’re really scaring me . I do n’t know what to do here . Tell me what you need . ”
389142	389149	389150	389150	she	4920	“ You did the right thing , ”
389216	389221	389222	389222	Jamie	1450	“ But , Nik , ”
389225	389235	389222	389222	Jamie	1450	“ now it ’s time to let yourself heal . ”
389236	389242	389243	389243	I	5148	“ I just need time , ”
389248	389254	389222	389222	Jamie	1450	“ Time heals , right ? ”
389255	389261	389262	389262	she	4920	“ I do n’t know , ”
389265	389278	389262	389262	she	4920	“ I thought so , but now I just do n’t know . ”
389300	389304	389305	389305	he	837	“ Come on , ”
389318	389322	389305	389305	he	837	“ What the — ”
389323	389330	389305	389305	he	837	“ We ’re taking a walk . ”
389331	389334	389335	389335	I	5148	“ No . ”
389341	389346	389347	389347	He	837	“ Goddammit , yes . ”
389372	389391	389347	389347	He	837	“ Corner store . Ice cream . And I ’ll fucking carry you there if I have to . ”
389435	389442	389443	389443	he	837	“ You fucked up , Nikki , ”
389504	389513	389579	389579	I	5148	“ I ’ve seen him , you know . ”
389519	389578	389579	389579	I	5148	“ I went with Maynard to the apartment yesterday . He ’s missed too many appointments , and there was stuff that had to be handled . Signed . Life and business moving on . But , Nikki , Damien ’s not moving on . He ’s wrecked . Shit , I think he ’s worse than you . ”
389604	389613	389614	389614	I	5148	“ I do n’t want to hear this , ”
389617	389635	389614	389614	I	5148	“ Just talk to him . Go see him . Jesus , Nikki , fight for it . ”
389659	389743	389750	389750	he	5148	“ Goddammit , Ollie , do n’t you get it ? I am fighting . I ’m fighting every day not to run back to him . I ’m fighting because I love him . And because I do , I ca n’t see him ripped to shreds . You saw how he was in Germany , and that was just a few people who saw those pictures . If those photos get out in the world , it will completely destroy him . ”
389744	389749	389750	389750	he	5148	“ But , Nik , ”
389754	389759	389750	389750	he	5148	“ He already is . ”
389805	389809	389812	389812	Sylvia	356	“ Stark International . ”
389820	389841	389812	389812	Sylvia	356	“ I — oh — I must have hit the wrong button . I thought I dialed Damien ’s cell . ”
389842	389846	389847	389847	Her	356	“ Ms. Fairchild . ”
389866	389876	389812	389812	Sylvia	356	“ He forwarded his cellular calls to the office . ”
389877	389896	389847	389847	Her	356	“ Oh . Where is he ? I ’ll call the house or the apartment or wherever directly . ”
389953	389993	389950	389950	his	4926	“ I ’m sorry , Ms. Fairchild , I do n’t know where he is . He left yesterday . No number , no address . He said he was leaving the country . He said he needed time . ”
390005	390024	389994	389994	I	5148	“ I see . If he — if he calls , will you ask him to call me ? ”
390025	390029	390030	390030	she	4927	“ I will , ”
390033	390044	390030	390030	she	4927	“ It will be the first thing I tell him . ”
390184	390192	390193	390193	she	914	“ Popcorn and Arsenic and Old Lace , ”
390202	390215	390193	390193	she	914	“ I ’ll make the popcorn while you set up the movie . ”
390326	390331	390336	390336	Jamie	1450	“ Oh , God . ”
390355	390378	390348	390348	I	5148	“ I ca n’t believe she did it . I ca n’t believe that bitch sent those pictures to the press anyway . ”
390379	390386	390387	390387	I	5148	“ Damien must be a mess . ”
390396	390404	390405	390405	Jamie	1450	“ I thought he was n’t there , ”
390442	390460	390479	390479	her	4047	“ I ’m so sorry , Ms. Fairchild . We have n’t heard from him for weeks . ”
390461	390473	390479	390479	her	4047	“ But the news — he — is he in town ? ”
390485	390497	390482	390482	she	4047	“ I do n’t know . I wish that I did . ”
390498	390505	390506	390506	Jamie	1450	“ What else can you do ? ”
390518	390529	390530	390530	I	5148	“ I do n’t know , I do n’t know . ”
390601	390606	390607	390607	I	5148	“ It ’s okay , ”
390610	390618	390607	390607	I	5148	“ I know how to find him . ”
391235	391239	391240	391240	he	5148	“ You left , ”
391243	391251	391240	391240	he	5148	“ Goddammit , Nikki , you left . ”
391324	391327	391328	391328	he	5148	“ Nikki , ”
391336	391345	391328	391328	he	5148	“ Nikki , oh , God , Nikki . ”
391471	391476	391477	391477	I	5148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
391486	391513	391477	391477	I	5148	“ I ’m so sorry she did that . I ca n’t believe she ’d do that . She said if I broke up with you — ”
391528	391532	391533	391533	he	5148	“ I know , ”
391537	391558	391533	391533	he	5148	“ Ollie told me . He told me what you did , and he told me why you did it . ”
391602	391618	391583	391583	He	837	“ You ’re a goddamn fool , Nikki Fairchild . And I love you desperately . ”
391669	391680	391681	391681	He	837	“ I think maybe we should get in the car . ”
391710	391714	391703	391703	I	5148	“ Roughing it ? ”
391715	391754	391755	391755	I	5148	“ I have n’t wanted luxury . I ’ve been living in motels , the backs of cars . I ’ve been all over Europe and I do n’t think I ’ve really seen one inch of it . ”
391772	391799	391800	391800	He	837	“ Tonight , I was going to drive to the desert . I thought I ’d sleep under the stars . I thought it might help . ”
391836	391842	391843	391843	I	5148	“ It would n’t have , ”
391860	391863	391864	391864	he	5148	“ No , ”
391867	391872	391864	391864	he	5148	“ It would n’t . ”
391888	391898	391880	391880	he	5148	“ Dear God , Nikki . Are you real ? ”
391915	391922	391923	391923	He	5148	“ Thank God you found me . ”
391951	391961	391962	391962	I	5148	“ I ’ve been looking for you for hours , ”
391966	391978	391962	391962	I	5148	“ Ever since I saw the news . Are you okay ? ”
392013	392018	392019	392019	he	5148	“ I am now , ”
392022	392033	391994	391994	Damien	5148	“ I do n’t understand why she released the photos . ”
392034	392039	392040	392040	Damien	5148	“ She did n’t , ”
392043	392047	392040	392040	Damien	5148	“ I did . ”
392056	392064	392048	392048	I	5148	“ You ? But — but why ? ”
392065	392075	392076	392076	He	5148	“ Because I did n’t have any other choice . ”
392122	392150	392099	392099	I	5148	“ I was dying without you , and once Ollie told me the choice you made , I knew that I had to make one , too . ”
392151	392192	392198	392198	he	5148	“ But the photos — that ’s the thing you ’ve been fighting against all along . That abuse is the reason you would n’t testify . You were willing to go to jail rather than let it go public . ”
392193	392197	392198	392198	he	5148	“ I was , ”
392201	392240	392241	392241	He	5148	“ But I ’m an arrogant son of a bitch , and I do n’t think I ever really believed that the court would convict me . I do n’t think I believed that I could lose you . ”
392249	392347	392241	392241	He	5148	“ But I lost you anyway , Nikki , and I had to make a decision . And the truth is that I ’m doing fine . I would n’t call it an ideal situation having my private life be the topic of editorials and talk shows , but I ’m surviving . And it was my choice . Not a decision forced on me because my lawyers said I needed to put up a defense , but a real , honest decision where I weighed what I have and what I fear against what I want . ”
392356	392404	392405	392405	He	5148	“ What I mean is that there is only one thing that could rip me apart more than those photos — that did rip me apart — and that ’s losing you . So I balanced the weight of my past against the promise of my future . ”
392413	392418	392405	392405	He	5148	“ The future won . ”
392424	392453	392419	392419	My	5148	“ I ’m sorry for what I said to you . About secrets and shadows . I needed you to believe I was really breaking up with you . ”
392454	392459	392460	392460	he	5148	“ You were right , ”
392463	392499	392419	392419	My	5148	“ No , not entirely . But we do n’t have to argue about it . I know damn well your secrets are n’t going to start spilling out just because I won that argument . ”
392505	392512	392500	392500	His	5148	“ You probably have a point . ”
392529	392532	392533	392533	I	5148	“ What ? ”
392537	392546	392547	392547	He	5148	“ I ’m just happy you found me . ”
392550	392557	392547	392547	He	5148	“ How did you find me ? ”
392567	392576	392558	392558	I	5148	“ Sweetheart , I will always find you . ”
392577	392586	392587	392587	he	5148	“ I ’m very happy to hear that , ”
392718	392776	392695	392695	Damien	5148	“ I want to know everything you did these weeks we were apart . I do n’t want to feel like we ’ve missed a moment of our life together . But , Nikki , I do n’t give a damn about that now . All I want is you naked and wet and open for me . ”
392813	392825	392826	392826	I	5148	“ You can take care of the rest of that yourself , ”
392866	392876	392899	392899	he	5148	“ I think you want me , Ms. Fairchild . ”
392877	392880	392881	392881	I	5148	“ Desperately , ”
392904	392912	392913	392913	I	5148	“ Leave your T - shirt on , ”
392925	392933	392913	392913	I	5148	“ You look like a sexy rebel . ”
392937	392946	392934	392934	He	5148	“ I am . I thought you knew . ”
393030	393037	393038	393038	he	5148	“ I ’ve missed your taste , ”
393041	393122	393123	393123	He	4956	“ I ’ve missed feeling you slip beneath my fingers . The way your skin quivers when you ’re excited . I want to watch you aroused , I want to watch you come . I want to tie you up and spank your ass and make sure you know that you are mine , and that you damn well better not leave me again . But right now , baby , all I want is to be inside you . ”
393149	393160	393161	393161	His	4956	“ I ’m going to fuck you now , Nikki . ”
393174	393182	393161	393161	His	4956	“ Hard and deep and very thoroughly . ”
393183	393186	393187	393187	I	5148	“ Yes , ”
393190	393197	393187	393187	I	5148	“ Oh , please , yes . ”
393336	393341	393342	393342	he	4956	“ I love you , ”
393345	393349	393350	393350	I	5148	“ I know , ”
393388	393415	393416	393416	He	4956	“ How many billions do you have , Mr. Stark ? And we ’re making out in the back of a Jeep ? How very gauche . ”
393432	393447	393416	393416	He	4956	“ Fuck my billions , Ms. Fairchild . All I care about is you . ”
393449	393460	393461	393461	Jamie	1450	“ I want you to know I ’m not sad , ”
393542	393552	393553	393553	she	4960	“ I ’m completely excited for both of us , ”
393556	393563	393553	393553	she	4960	“ But you more than me . ”
393613	393619	393610	393610	she	4960	“ think about her shit . ”
393655	393668	393669	393669	I	5148	“ I ’m not going to say that I ’ll miss you , ”
393672	393685	393669	393669	I	5148	“ Because you ’ll be back . I ’m certain of it . ”
393686	393702	393638	393638	she	4960	“ If nothing else , I ’ll be back to bum a week in Malibu . ”
393703	393706	393707	393707	Damien	5148	“ Anytime , ”
393716	393726	393727	393727	she	4960	“ I got ta go pick up my car , ”
393730	393758	393710	393710	She	4960	“ I left it at the corner for an oil change and all that stuff . I do n’t really want to get stuck in El Paso . ”
393759	393764	393765	393765	I	5148	“ Call me tonight , ”
393790	393797	393798	393798	She	4960	“ Hell yeah , I will . ”
393830	393852	393814	393814	I	5148	“ We can go , too . I do n’t need to hang out in my empty room for nostalgia purposes . ”
393853	393859	393860	393860	he	5148	“ It ’s not empty , ”
393869	393875	393876	393876	I	5148	“ I ’m leaving it , ”
393909	393914	393915	393915	he	5148	“ Not the bed , ”
393918	393924	393915	393915	he	5148	“ The package on it . ”
393949	393954	393941	393941	I	5148	“ What is it ? ”
393955	393973	393915	393915	he	5148	“ I ’m going to suggest you take a walk on the wild side and open it . ”
393974	393977	393978	393978	I	5148	“ Funny , ”
394011	394023	394024	394024	Damien	5148	“ We faced reality and told it to go fuck itself , ”
394027	394056	394024	394024	Damien	5148	“ So now I think we should slide back into that bubble . One month . Europe . A limo . Five - star hotels . And you . ”
394057	394068	394069	394069	I	5148	“ Doing whatever you want , whenever you want it ? ”
394080	394091	394073	394073	His	5148	“ Ah , baby , you know me so well . ”
394092	394098	394099	394099	I	5148	“ I ca n’t wait , ”
394102	394112	394113	394113	he	5148	“ We can go back for round two later , ”
394116	394136	394113	394113	he	5148	“ Right now I can only take a month if I ’m going to be back for the gala . ”
394137	394141	394142	394142	I	5148	“ Of course , ”
394190	394195	394196	394196	Damien	5148	“ Just the continent ? ”
394367	394381	394382	394382	Damien	5148	“ I ’d like to spend a few days in Germany , too , ”
394399	394414	394415	394415	he	5148	“ We did n’t get to explore it before . And speaking of Germany , ”
394427	394458	394415	394415	he	5148	“ I bought this for you before the trial got underway . I planned to give it to you after I was acquitted , but I got a little sidetracked . ”
394459	394465	394415	394415	he	5148	“ Can I open it ? ”
394466	394470	394471	394471	he	5148	“ Of course , ”
394565	394568	394569	394569	I	5148	“ Damien , ”
394588	394596	394603	394603	he	5148	“ You bought this before the trial ? ”
394597	394602	394603	394603	he	5148	“ I told you , ”
394607	394634	394603	394603	he	5148	“ I never truly believed I could lose . Not the trial . Not you . Now I know better than to take anything for granted . ”
394682	394720	394721	394721	My	5148	“ There ’s only one woman in the world who can bring me to my knees . So tell me , Ms. Fairchild . Will you do me the greatest honor ? Will you be my wife ? ”
394774	394777	394757	394757	I	5148	“ Yes . ”
