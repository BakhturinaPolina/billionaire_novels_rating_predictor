2924	2950	2916	2916	she	43	“ I ’m serious , Aly . You know you want that Superman sex . Especially since you lost your good vibrator to the fire . ”
2951	2959	2970	2970	Evie	43	“ Ugh . Do n’t remind me . ”

2973	3029	3030	3030	I	0	“ But that just means you deserve a good lay tonight . Get some good dancing in , have dirty , wild sex with some stud , then pass out on this five thousand dollar mattress here . No way in hell you do n’t get at least six hours of sleep after all that . ”

4602	4605	4606	4606	he	45	“ What ? ”
4609	4641	4642	4642	He	45	“ Cut me some slack , I thought I was alone in here – I definitely did n’t expect a fucking gorgeous blonde to walk out playing with her own tits . ”

6187	6232	6233	6233	I	0	“ No , you ’ve been riled up . You ’re just trying to pretend otherwise because you do n’t want to believe that some stranger at a club is actually tempting you to break whatever rule you have about one - night stands . ”
6261	6277	6278	6278	he	45	“ I meant to ask , by the way – what was the other thing ? ”

6675	6678	6633	6633	His	45	“ Why ? ”
6679	6704	6705	6705	He	45	“ Because every time you squeeze my ass , you spread my pussy and it feels too good , so you have to stop . ”

8523	8561	8505	8505	Julian	39	“ Maybe if I was n’t completely joking when I said it . I did n’t think she ’d believe that I ’d be gone the whole damned summer . Have I ever been away that long ? ”
8562	8576	8505	8505	Julian	39	“ No , but why did you say it in the first place ? ”
8577	8606	8505	8505	Julian	39	“ Knee - jerk reaction ? She literally emailed me a list of her friends ’ daughters who were visiting either the Hamptons or the city this summer . ”
8607	8621	8622	8622	Julian	39	“ I take it she wanted you to ‘ show them around ? ’ ”
8642	8689	8690	8690	I	0	“ Yes , and you know by ‘ show them around , ’ she means entertain the idea of making one of them my future wife . And here I thought she ’d relax on the marriage and grandkids thing once you got married to Sara , ”
8736	8752	8753	8753	Julian	39	“ Well , I think my shotgun wedding left something to be desired for Mom , ”
8769	8784	8753	8753	Julian	39	“ Yeah , about that . That was a dick move on your part . ”
8785	8801	8753	8753	Julian	39	“ Forgive me . I did n’t feel like waiting to call Sara my wife . ”
8802	8811	8812	8812	I	0	“ God , you ’re soft these days , ”
8835	8842	8829	8829	Julian	39	“ Why are you throwing things ? ”
8843	8850	8753	8753	Julian	39	“ I ca n’t read that . ”
8851	8868	8869	8869	I	0	“ Well , if anyone could manage to graduate college illiterate , it would be you . ”
8875	8912	8869	8869	I	0	“ I mean I ca n’t concentrate , asshole . All I can think about is Aly , and I have no idea how the hell you expect me to wait all day to see her . ”
8913	8921	8922	8922	Julian	39	“ She runs a business , Emmett , ”
8937	9000	8932	8933	the waitress	301	“ She already hates you too , so if you want any chance of convincing her to stay for the summer , the last thing you should do is bring your drama to her place of work . Besides , you clearly need the time to cool off from … whatever the hell it was that happened between you two last night . ”
9010	9020	9021	9021	I	0	“ Yeah , you ’re not wrong about that , ”
9092	9095	9096	9096	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
9105	9133	9096	9096	I	0	“ Yeah , on that note , I ’m leaving . I ’d prefer not to sit here and watch you get actively hard over Aly Stanton . ”
9134	9153	9079	9079	she	303	“ You ’re leaving because this is the time every week that you pick up Sara from yoga . ”
9154	9158	9079	9079	she	303	“ Also true . ”
9159	9193	9096	9096	I	0	“ You know I ’d be pissed about losing all my closest friends to marriage , but watching a work - obsessed sociopath like yourself get whipped has been great entertainment for me . ”
9194	9198	9199	9199	I	0	“ Fuck off . ”
9202	9234	9199	9199	I	0	“ And you wonder why I ’m stuck hanging out with an asshole like Drew . It ’s because you , Lukas – all my closest friends are wifed up now . ”
9235	9279	9280	9280	Julian	39	“ Well , hopefully by some miracle , you ’ll be able to join the club soon . In the meantime , I ’m out . Your friend has just arrived and I ’m not interested in being seen with him right now , ”
9324	9328	9317	9317	Julian	39	“ Mr. Maddox . ”
9329	9333	9317	9317	Julian	39	“ Mr. Hoult . ”
9334	9346	9347	9347	Julian	39	“ I ’m going to pretend I never saw you here , ”
9355	9381	9347	9347	Julian	39	“ But for the record , I do n’t endorse this . I trust you ’ll be home in time for your PT appointment tomorrow . ”
9382	9392	9393	9393	Drew	298	“ Yes , sir , you bet your ass , ”
9449	9457	9458	9458	Drew	298	“ How you holding up , buddy ? ”
9496	9520	9521	9521	I	0	“ So you got pictures of this girl or what ? Because I have trouble believing she ’s as hot as you say . ”
9524	9537	9521	9521	I	0	“ In that case , I look forward to you meeting her . ”
9538	9561	9484	9486	the blushing waitress	307	“ Well , if she ’s even half as good - looking as you claim , I look forward to it too . ”
9562	9599	9521	9521	I	0	“ Actually , I just decided that you ’re never meeting her . And if you ever try anything on her I ’ll make sure you ’re on the DL for the rest of the year . ”
9600	9615	9521	9521	I	0	“ At which point your brother would kill you . The team needs me . ”
9616	9634	9484	9486	the blushing waitress	307	“ Yeah , which is why you ’re partying in the Hamptons instead of rehabbing your injury . ”
9635	9648	9649	9649	Drew	298	“ It ’s a muscle contusion . It ’ll heal by tomorrow , ”
9754	9760	9761	9761	Drew	298	“ The hell was that ? ”
9776	9779	9773	9773	I	0	“ What ? ”
9780	9798	9761	9761	Drew	298	“ She was hot as all fuck and she was basically thrusting her tits in your face . ”
9799	9809	9773	9773	I	0	“ Yeah ? I do n’t remember that happening . ”
9810	9837	9761	9761	Drew	298	“ You would n’t . Your eyes were attached to your phone like a fuckin ’ high school girl . Who are you texting ? Her ? ”
9839	9841	9842	9842	he	298	“ her ”
9869	9888	9864	9864	he	298	“ I got her number from my mom . I was checking if she responded to my text . ”
9889	9896	9864	9864	he	298	“ What ’d your text say ? ”
9897	9919	9864	9864	he	298	“ I was asking if I could see her at work . Or if I ’d just see her at home . ”
9920	9923	9924	9924	Drew	298	“ Christ . ”
9941	9973	9864	9864	he	298	“ Since when did you get this desperate ? You ’re the one who preaches the whole ignore - them - till - they - come - to - you trick . ”
9974	9985	9864	9864	he	298	“ Yeah , that does n’t really apply to her . ”
9986	10007	10008	10008	I	0	“ Why not ? And if you say ‘ because she ’s different , ’ I ’m going to hurl . ”
10020	10029	10030	10030	he	298	“ Jesus fuck . So she is different , ”
10037	10047	10030	10030	he	298	“ Magical tits aside , what ’s so special ? ”
10473	10490	10468	10468	her	325	“ I do n’t know , man , I ’ve just known her my whole life , ”
11007	11019	10999	10999	Evie	43	“ You really need to stop being so delighted about this , ”
11037	11055	11056	11056	I	0	“ How would you feel if you hooked up with basically your high school bully ? Huh ? ”
11059	11089	11056	11056	I	0	“ It ’s horrifying , Evie . I keep having these moments where I ca n’t breathe . I feel like I ’m going to actually die of embarrassment . ”
11090	11095	11096	11096	Evie	43	“ What ? Why ? ”
11120	11179	11180	11180	Evie	43	“ Why be embarrassed about wanting Emmett if he wants you back ? Seriously , Aly , what happened between you two last night was hotter than any porn I ’ve ever watched in my life , and that ’s saying a lot because Mike and I have n’t had sex in three months , and I ’ve – ”
11195	11208	11209	11209	she	43	“ And I ’ve been watching a lot of porn , assholes ! ”
11226	11271	11272	11272	I	0	“ Honest to God , Aly . This could wind up being an amazing summer of nonstop dirty , sweaty hate - fucking for you . And that could very well be what you need to fall asleep every night . Right ? Right ? ”
11284	11319	11320	11320	Evie	43	“ Evie . Have we forgotten that my hatred for Emmett is like , real hatred and not foreplay hatred ? You do remember that I despise him , right ? Like , truly ? ”
11332	11361	11362	11362	she	43	“ Yeah , but ca n’t we agree that he was a kid when he tortured you like that and he ’s probably grown out of that shit ? ”
11365	11372	11362	11362	she	43	“ It ’s not that simple . ”
11373	11410	11362	11362	she	43	“ It could be ! Half your relationship was comprised of getting each other in trouble with your teachers or your parents , but now that you ’re adults , none of that shit exists anymore ! ”
11411	11423	11424	11424	I	0	“ Yeah , but what about … the thing he did ? ”
11619	11630	11631	11631	I	0	“ You know what – do n’t answer that question , ”
11635	11638	11639	11639	I	0	“ Just … ”
11652	11693	11645	11645	I	0	“ Tell me my next move , Evie . He ’s been texting me all day about wanting to see me , and I do n’t know what to do or say because my brain is completely broken right now . ”
11694	11697	11698	11698	Evie	43	“ Fine . ”
11724	11727	11710	11710	she	43	“ Aly . ”
11742	11793	11735	11735	she	43	“ If we ’re being real here … financially speaking , you ca n’t afford anything else . As both your business partner and your closest friend , I can tell you objectively that your best move here is to do anything you can to make things work with Emmett . ”
11807	11823	11800	11800	she	43	“ Even if it means wasting his hotness and forcing him to be completely platonic . ”
11831	11849	11824	11824	I	0	“ Somehow , I do n’t think the platonic thing is going to work after last night . ”
11850	11910	11911	11911	I	0	“ Well , it ’s either that or move in with me and Mike . Because you ca n’t afford to rent even a motel room from now till Labor Day , Aly . Even the shittiest one that ’s close enough to work is going to cost you well over five grand for the rest of the summer . ”
12054	12068	12069	12069	I	0	“ So basically , I have no choice but to stay with Emmett , ”
12072	12075	12076	12076	Evie	43	“ Yep ! ”
12086	12094	12095	12095	she	43	“ Oh , come on , Aly , ”
12102	12156	12095	12095	she	43	“ It ’s going to be fine . I ’m sure that you two can coexist platonically under one roof . And if for some reason , you fall out of the shower one day and land on his cock , that wo n’t be the worst thing in the world , right ? ”
12276	12291	12294	12294	her	43	“ Oh my God , hi . Hi ! Where ’d you come from ? ”
12476	12481	12464	12464	Ozzy	440	“ Oh . Hi . ”
12503	12506	12507	12507	I	0	“ Hey , ”
12601	12604	12590	12590	I	0	“ Aly … ”
12605	12615	12616	12616	Aly	43	“ Wait , Emmett . Let me start first . ”
12630	12635	12616	12616	Aly	43	“ About last night … ”
12655	12662	12649	12649	she	43	“ It was a big mistake . ”
12667	12674	12675	12675	I	0	“ What makes you say that ? ”
12691	12702	12703	12703	she	43	“ Wait . Just … stay there for a second , ”
12707	12910	12911	12911	She	348	“ Because before you say anything else , I just need to say this : I know I ’m the one who ’s in a bad situation right now , and I ’m the one who needs the favor of crashing here , so I ’m really in no place to make demands about how you live in your own house . Beggars ca n’t be choosers , and I know that … but I also know I ca n’t survive under the same roof as you unless we agree to be strictly platonic and pretend like last night did n’t happen at all . It ’s just too weird and irresponsible , and I ’d probably move out the second something inappropriate happened again , so I might as well just tell you this now . If you ’re for some reason okay with us being friends , I ’m going to officially ask you if I can stay here for the summer , because Lord knows I need it . But if you do n’t think that ’s possible , I ’ll pack my bags now and I promise you wo n’t have to hear from me again . Okay ? ”
12951	12959	12960	12960	she	348	“ Did you … process all that ? ”
12964	12971	12972	12972	I	0	“ Emmett . Please say something . ”
13052	13066	13067	13067	Her	348	“ It ’s all good , Aly . We can keep it platonic . ”
13170	13173	13174	13174	Aly	43	“ Really ? ”
13218	13221	13222	13222	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
13226	13229	13222	13222	I	0	“ Really . ”
13230	13240	13222	13222	I	0	“ That wo n’t … be hard for you ? ”
13264	13279	13280	13280	I	0	“ Should n’t be . I ’m pretty famous for having a short memory , ”
13301	13323	13324	13324	he	39	“ Something pisses you off and a second later , you ’re fine again . It ’s like a magic trick , ”
13457	13474	13475	13475	Aly	223	“ I … wow . I ca n’t believe you ’re being so cool about this , ”
13486	13516	13481	13481	she	223	“ I mean – I did n’t mean it like that . I ’m just … I ’m a little surprised . But extremely grateful . Okay . Wow . ”
13539	13568	13569	13569	she	223	“ I ca n’t even begin to describe how much you ’re saving my ass , Emmett . So thank you . A million times , thank you , ”
13586	13600	13601	13601	I	0	“ I would give you a hug but you ’re … all sweaty . ”
13686	13697	13698	13698	I	0	“ No worries . I ’ll take a rain check , ”
13701	13706	13698	13698	I	0	“ Ha - ha ! ”
13734	13742	13729	13729	I	0	“ Anyway , I should shower now . ”
13743	13754	13755	13755	Aly	223	“ Oh yeah – sorry ! Go do your thing ! ”
13873	13902	13903	13903	he	1603	“ These are all the people who write the biggest checks to my foundation , so I ca n’t flake on their parties without looking like an asshole , ”
13949	13951	13942	13942	I	0	“ no ”
13962	13970	13971	13971	he	1603	“ Aly . It ’s all good , ”
14380	14398	14371	14371	I	0	“ It literally says no flip flops or shorts , Emmett , and I ’m wearing both , ”
14443	14456	14457	14457	he	1603	“ Yeah , I do n’t think it ’ll be a problem , ”
14469	14479	14457	14457	he	1603	“ Yeah , except what makes you so sure ? ”
14493	14500	14486	14486	Emmett	1603	“ Because I own this place . ”
14629	14647	14648	14648	Geez	74	“ Emmett , do you remember my name ? I bet you do n’t remember my name ! ”
14688	14695	14682	14682	he	1603	“ just send some things out . ”
14719	14725	14700	14701	the manager	384	“ no , thank you , ”
14746	14753	14754	14754	I	0	“ Guess some things never change , ”
14757	14763	14754	14754	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
14764	14782	14783	14783	I	0	“ All that just now was pretty much what high school looked like from my vantage point , ”
14789	14829	14830	14830	Emmett	1603	“ You walking down the hall , girls fawning over you , and then someone coming up and asking if you have everything you need – usually one of my friends making sure that she did your homework right . ”
14833	14859	14830	14830	Emmett	1603	“ I still get attention from women , but I can pretty much assure you that everything else about me has changed since high school . ”
14860	14863	14864	14864	I	0	“ Really . ”
14879	14888	14830	14830	Emmett	1603	“ That ’s kind of hard to believe . ”
14889	14908	14909	14909	He	1603	“ Why ? Everyone changes after high school . I mean look at you . You ’ve changed … ”
14914	14921	14922	14922	I	0	“ A lot since high school . ”
14956	14971	14972	14972	I	0	“ Yes , you ’re right . My hair is long and blonde again , ”
15000	15030	14997	14997	Emmett	1603	“ Actually , yeah , that ’s a pretty huge change . I ’m pretty sure it ’s the only reason I did n’t recognize you that night we – ”
15031	15036	15037	15037	My	0	“ Ah , ah . ”
15058	15063	15064	15064	Emmett	1603	“ Oh . Right , ”
15086	15091	15077	15077	I	0	“ Change of topic . ”
15092	15108	15109	15109	I	0	“ Yes . Let ’s go back to how you ’ve changed since high school , ”
15116	15119	15120	15120	He	1603	“ Fine . ”
15123	15148	15149	15149	Emmett	1603	“ Well , for starters I do n’t play football anymore , and that was a pretty big part of my identity back then , ”
15152	15171	15172	15172	I	0	“ Plus , I ’m way more responsible now since , you know . I have a kid . ”
15178	15190	15191	15191	I	0	“ You do ? Oh God , when did that happen ? ”
15218	15227	15205	15205	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah … I was talking about Ozzy . ”
15228	15231	15232	15232	I	0	“ Oh . ”
15239	15259	15232	15232	I	0	“ But good to know that you ’d react to me having a kid with that kind of horror . ”
15260	15283	15284	15284	I	0	“ Oh my God , I ’m sorry . I just … ca n’t imagine you being responsible for another human life , ”
15298	15325	15295	15295	Emmett	1603	“ Hey , believe it or not , I ’m a good caretaker . And someday , I ’m going to be a damned good father . ”
15326	15334	15335	15335	I	0	“ Oh – of course you are ! ”
15351	15380	15381	15381	I	0	“ I mean you ’re a good dad to Ozzy , obviously , and you did have pretty much the best possible role model in the dad department , ”
15513	15516	15522	15522	he	387	“ Emmett … ”
15527	15534	15522	15522	he	387	“ It ’s okay , Aly . ”
15552	15574	15575	15575	I	0	“ No … it ’s not . You messaged me on Facebook that week , and I did n’t even answer , ”
15602	15636	15597	15597	I	0	“ Emmett , I ’m so sorry . Regardless of what happened between us , we were always like family , so that was the worst time I could have possibly ignored you . ”
15637	15659	15660	15660	Emmett	1603	“ It ’s fine , Aly . We were kids and we were both in the eye of our own storm , ”
15676	15739	15672	15672	he	1603	“ Oh , that was just what my mom said back then . She said however bad I was feeling , it did n’t mean that you did n’t have pain of your own to deal with . Everyone ’s got their own lives to live . And honestly , it was better for me to learn that sooner rather than later . ”
15825	15833	15834	15834	I	0	“ Thank you for being so understanding , ”
15842	15867	15834	15834	I	0	“ Like your mom explained , I was just … going through such a hard time because of that whole thing between us and – ”
15868	15872	15834	15834	I	0	“ About that – ”
15873	15876	15877	15877	I	0	“ No . ”
15888	15893	15894	15894	I	0	“ Let ’s not , ”
15897	15931	15932	15932	I	0	“ Right ? I mean it ’s our first time having dinner together as adults , so should n’t we just … try to enjoy our night instead of talking about the past ? ”
15971	15983	15984	15984	he	1603	“ We can talk about whatever you want to talk about , ”
16010	16017	16018	16018	Emmett	1603	“ Easy . Drink some water , ”
16026	16030	16031	16031	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
16083	16092	16093	16093	Emmett	1603	“ Breathe , Aly . You good now ? ”
16144	16156	16142	16142	me	0	“ Oh my God – Seafood Girl ? Is that you ? ”
16291	16306	16307	16307	Britt	75	“ Oh my God , so hilarious to see you here of all places , ”
16317	16340	16341	16341	she	75	“ Are you catering some event ? Did you meet my bestie Emmett Hoult ? Is n’t he just dee - vine ? ”
16563	16592	16593	16593	he	1603	“ Actually , Britt , Aly here is one of my oldest friends . She ’s the only person I ’ve pretty much known since I was born , ”
16603	16620	16593	16593	he	1603	“ Oh . Is that right ? So she ’s known you longer than I have ? ”
16637	16681	16682	16682	she	75	“ I ’ve been BFF with Emmett for like , ten years now . I interned at the events place that did his fraternity ’s Black and White ball , and I guess we pretty much hit it off from there , right ? ”
16710	16720	16698	16698	Emmett	1603	“ Yes , Britt . I guess we did . ”
16721	16749	16750	16750	Britt	75	“ Mm - hm . And – oh ! Speaking of events , I happen to be planning the party for Emmett ’s big fundraiser next month , ”
16758	16784	16785	16785	Her	75	“ I ’m not even exaggerating when I say it ’s going to be the event of the summer , so you should totally come . ”
16799	16809	16810	16810	she	75	“ But definitely do n’t wear that . Right ? ”
16820	16836	16810	16810	she	75	“ Do n’t worry . Aly ’s got some pretty killer dresses in her arsenal . ”
16869	16879	16880	16880	she	75	“ Oop ! Looks like my date ’s here ! ”
16915	16922	16906	16906	She	75	“ Emmett , you know Natalie . ”
16923	16934	16935	16935	Emmett	1603	“ Of course . How have you been , Natalie ? ”
17005	17019	17020	17020	Britt	75	“ Ookay . Maybe go a lil ’ subtler next time , babe , ”
17032	17053	17054	17054	she	77	“ Guess I ’ll escort her away . But talk soon , both of you ! Have a good evening ! ”
17103	17106	17107	17107	he	1603	“ What ? ”
17111	17127	17128	17128	Emmett	1603	“ That was actually going to be my question because what the heck was that ? ”
17132	17143	17128	17128	Emmett	1603	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re talking about . ”
17144	17166	17167	17167	I	0	“ I ’m talking about the girl you apparently pissed off so bad she can only yell at you via text , ”
17170	17183	17167	17167	I	0	“ Something tells me she ’s a particularly scorned ex of yours . ”
17184	17206	17128	17128	Emmett	1603	“ She ’s not . I ’m not sure you can call any of the women I ’ve been with exes . ”
17207	17220	17167	17167	I	0	“ Why ? You ’re still actively sleeping with all of them ? ”
17221	17240	17241	17241	Emmett	1603	“ No . More like I do n’t sleep with anyone for long enough to become a boyfriend , ”
17244	17255	17241	17241	Emmett	1603	“ Well , how long were you with Natalie for ? ”
17256	17289	17290	17290	I	0	“ I was never with her – we spent a little more than a week hooking up . And I did tell her before we started that I do n’t do relationships . ”
17295	17301	17290	17290	I	0	“ You really do n’t ? ”
17302	17307	17241	17241	Emmett	1603	“ You seem surprised . ”
17308	17328	17329	17329	I	0	“ Well , the fact that you give official disclaimers before even hooking up with someone is pretty serious , ”
17332	17364	17365	17365	I	0	“ Plus , you ’ve just always been the kind of guy who likes having someone take care of you . That was definitely the case in high school at least . ”
17489	17507	17508	17508	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah , well , I ’ve learned how to take care of myself since high school , ”
17519	17530	17508	17508	Emmett	1603	“ That ’s just a part of being an adult . ”
17531	17545	17466	17467	a girlfriend	402	“ So is learning how to commit to someone , is n’t it ? ”
17546	17554	17508	17508	Emmett	1603	“ I do n’t have the time . ”
17555	17572	17573	17573	I	0	“ Yeah , what with the grueling nine - to - five you do n’t have , ”
17576	17594	17573	17573	I	0	“ I ca n’t imagine that your mom does n’t give you a hard time about this . ”
17595	17619	17466	17467	a girlfriend	402	“ She does , but that does n’t change the fact that I have much more important priorities than being in a relationship . ”
17620	17627	17573	17573	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? Like what ? ”
17628	17640	17641	17641	Emmett	1603	“ Nothing I feel the need to talk about , Aly , ”
17667	17676	17664	17664	I	0	“ Oh . Okay . That ’s cool , ”
17755	17758	17751	17751	I	0	“ Well … ”
17774	17787	17759	17759	I	0	“ I ’m totally with you on the no relationship thing anyway , ”
17801	17809	17796	17796	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah ? And why is that ? ”
17810	17820	17821	17821	I	0	“ Because like you said , bigger priorities exist , ”
17824	17853	17821	17821	I	0	“ I ’ve got a restaurant to run , you ’ve got … whatever your job is . So fuck relationships . Who needs ‘ em ? Right ? ”
17884	17890	17891	17891	he	1603	“ Yeah . Fuck relationships , ”
17894	17904	17891	17891	he	1603	“ Sex will do in the meantime . Right ? ”
18050	18067	18068	18068	he	298	“ For Christ ’s sake , E , she goes to bed at 10PM every night , ”
18105	18133	18134	18134	Drew	298	“ Are you really going to miss out on Iain ’s birthday party that I planned just to spend an hour asking this girl about her day ? ”
18188	18223	18224	18224	Drew	298	“ Look , if you ’re not fucking her , you ’re not allowed to stay home for her . That ’s just the rule . I do n’t care how hot she is , ”
18232	18259	18229	18229	he	298	“ Wait . Actually that ’s not true – I do . Are you ever going to show me a damned picture ? Send it now . ”
18260	18263	18306	18306	Aly	223	“ No . ”
18264	18274	18275	18275	My	0	“ Then I ’ll just have to meet her . ”
18283	18297	18275	18275	My	0	“ Yeah , I ’m never going to let you go anywhere near – ”
18298	18301	18302	18302	I	0	“ Hey . ”
18318	18327	18328	18328	Drew	298	“ Ooh , shit , was that her ? ”
18354	18357	18358	18358	I	0	“ No , ”
18364	18381	18358	18358	I	0	“ Fuck you . Put her on the phone . I need to talk to her . ”
18382	18387	18388	18388	I	0	“ Yeah , never , ”
18578	18583	18584	18584	Drew	298	“ You ignoring me ? ”
18591	18594	18584	18584	Drew	298	“ Iain ! ”
18602	18615	18616	18616	Iain	79	“ Iain , talk to this asshole . He ’s ignoring me . ”
18708	18718	18719	18719	she	223	“ Are you laughing ‘ cause I ’m short ? ”
18911	18932	18933	18933	Drew	298	“ Listen , dickhead . If you ’re bailing on tonight , I better hear by tomorrow that you closed , ”
18943	18974	18933	18933	Drew	298	“ Either shit or get off the pot , ‘ cause this is fucked up . You were supposed to be my wingman tonight . Everyone else here is couples . ”
18975	18980	18981	18981	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
19036	19050	19025	19025	She	223	“ Hey , so tell me . What ’s she wearing right now ? ”
19059	19068	19051	19051	Drew	298	“ She wearing a bra or is she – ”
19069	19077	19078	19078	I	0	“ Yeah , cool – have fun , ”
19135	19142	19143	19143	she	223	“ So you going out tonight ? ”
19184	19190	19191	19191	I	0	“ Nah . Staying in , ”
19200	19208	19209	19209	Aly	223	“ Wanna watch a movie with me ? ”
19215	19218	19219	19219	she	223	“ Oh , ”
19253	19256	19239	19239	She	223	“ Umm . ”
19265	19292	19239	19239	She	223	“ Sure . I think . I mean I do n’t know if I can commit to a whole movie but I can definitely start one . ”
19293	19296	19297	19297	I	0	“ Really ? ”
19315	19331	19303	19303	I	0	“ What kind of person goes into a movie knowing she ca n’t finish it ? ”
19332	19344	19345	19345	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Your roommate , I guess . ”
19431	19455	19423	19423	I	0	“ Well , if that ’s what you want to do then pick out a movie and I ’ll grab us some snacks , ”
19468	19484	19465	19465	Aly	223	“ Uh … you really want to give me the freedom to pick the movie ? ”
19485	19496	19497	19497	I	0	“ Why not ? We always watch the same stuff , ”
19538	19547	19531	19531	I	0	“ Damn . You watch girly stuff now ? ”
19562	19573	19574	19574	Aly	223	“ Oh yeah . Fuckin ’ love girly stuff now , ”
19588	19602	19603	19603	I	0	“ Rom - coms , reality shows – pretty much everything on Lifetime . ”
19606	19617	19603	19603	I	0	“ You used to hate that shit with a passion . ”
19618	19649	19650	19650	We	418	“ Well , now I love it with a passion . I mean I always did , I just did n’t let myself – never mind . It ’s starting . ”
19740	19748	19749	19749	Aly	223	“ Oh … kay . Well then . ”
19948	19959	19944	19944	he	421	“ Unh … ahh … oh , fuck … yeah . ”
20034	20044	20030	20030	she	419	“ I ’m gon na make a new tea . ”
20045	20050	20051	20051	She	419	“ Figured you might . ”
20057	20065	20051	20051	She	419	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
20066	20077	20078	20078	I	0	“ That you ’re awkward about watching a sex scene , ”
20081	20097	20078	20078	I	0	“ With me , at least . And that ’s fine . I get it . ”
20098	20108	20109	20109	she	419	“ Get what ? I ’m not being awkward , ”
20113	20122	20109	20109	she	419	“ I just wanted a glass of water . ”
20123	20136	20078	20078	I	0	“ You just said you were going to make a new tea . ”
20137	20145	20078	20078	I	0	“ Well , maybe I wanted both ! ”
20146	20164	20165	20165	Aly	223	“ Or maybe you ca n’t survive watching a girl getting her tits played with like that . ”
20174	20181	20182	20182	she	419	“ Why would that bother me ? ”
20194	20204	20205	20205	she	419	“ You know what , Emmett ? Screw it ! ”
20215	20231	20205	20205	she	419	“ You can wipe that smug look off your face , because I ’m watching . ”
20232	20239	20240	20240	I	0	“ Aly , it ’s fine , ”
20243	20256	20240	20240	I	0	“ We can fast - forward if you ca n’t handle it . ”
20257	20278	20279	20279	Aly	223	“ Ca n’t handle it ? I ’m an adult , Emmett , I assure you I can handle it , ”
20720	20730	20714	20714	I	0	“ Oh , that pup looks almost like Ozzy , ”
20743	20746	20747	20747	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
20860	20867	20850	20850	she	419	“ I should get to bed . ”
20868	20873	20874	20874	I	0	“ Sure . Night , ”
20877	20882	20874	20874	I	0	“ Goodnight , Emmett . ”
20926	20937	20938	20938	Evie	43	“ Wow . Someone ’s surprisingly eager to get out , ”
20950	20962	20941	20941	she	43	“ You finally getting excited to go home to that hottie ? ”
20963	20971	20972	20972	I	0	“ Uh , no . Not exactly . ”
21056	21072	21073	21073	she	43	“ So what ’s your plan of attack to get back in the friend zone ? ”
21091	21141	21073	21073	she	43	“ Honestly , I do n’t have one . I just figured hanging around him and having a conversation while acting completely normal would be good enough . I just want to prove to him that I ’m fine . That I ’m not like , actively wanting him . ”
21142	21168	21169	21169	Evie	43	“ Which you are . But – ooh ! You know what you should do ? Call him ‘ dude ’ as much as possible , ”
21187	21202	21203	21203	she	43	“ Mike has been calling me that these days and I fucking hate it , ”
21210	21269	21203	21203	she	43	“ It just makes me feel so … desexualized . Like he sees me as nothing more than a friend . ‘ Cause honestly , has anyone in the history of having sex been like , ‘ You have such beautiful breasts , dude , ’ or ‘ Mmm , dude , you feel amazing inside me ? ’ ”
21270	21277	21278	21278	I	0	“ Oh my God , Evie . ”
21364	21377	21378	21378	I	0	“ Alright . Calling him ‘ dude . ’ Definitely doing that , ”
21395	21402	21387	21387	she	43	“ Are you heading home now ? ”
21413	21420	21387	21387	she	43	“ Nope . Couple ’s therapy . ”
21421	21431	21432	21432	I	0	“ Oh . Right . Has that been helping ? ”
21436	21444	21445	21445	Evie	43	“ Totally . Like , so much , ”
21475	21480	21481	21481	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
21496	21510	21511	21511	she	43	“ And you wonder why I ’m dying for you to fuck Emmett , ”
21521	21537	21511	21511	she	43	“ My life outside this restaurant sucks . I need to live vicariously through somebody . ”
21538	21577	21584	21584	Evie	43	“ Well , if you want to live vicariously through me and Emmett being just friends , then by all means , because that ’s how things are staying all summer . And till the end of time . ”
21578	21583	21584	21584	Evie	43	“ Mm - hm , ”
21761	21764	21765	21765	he	1603	“ Hey ! ”
21779	21785	21773	21773	I	0	“ That was … sketchy , ”
21855	21858	21841	21841	he	1603	“ Dude . ”
21864	21870	21859	21859	I	0	“ What were you doing ? ”
21887	21894	21882	21882	Emmett	1603	“ Nothing . Just work stuff . ”
21895	21901	21902	21902	I	0	“ What ’s work stuff ? ”
21916	21936	21902	21902	I	0	“ I still do n’t even know what you do for a living . What exactly is your job ? ”
21937	21946	21947	21947	Emmett	1603	“ I just do stuff here and there , ”
21962	21976	21977	21977	I	0	“ Holy shit , Emmett . What do you do for a living ? ”
21980	21992	21993	21993	He	1603	“ What are you – a hitman ? A male stripper ? ”
21998	22008	22009	22009	He	1603	“ You think I could be a male stripper ? ”
22027	22043	22044	22044	Emmett	1603	“ Long story short , I invest in whatever stocks or properties Julian invests in , ”
22058	22061	22044	22044	Emmett	1603	“ Oh . ”
22067	22083	22044	22044	Emmett	1603	“ Good move though . Julian ’s always been a genius , has n’t he ? ”
22084	22101	22044	22044	Emmett	1603	“ Pretty much . And now he owns the Empires . I ’m sure you heard . ”
22102	22117	22118	22118	I	0	“ Uh , yeah , my dad basically flipped out the day that happened , ”
22146	22166	22143	22144	Julian Hoult	39	“ Emmett ’s older brother , and the same Julian you grew up going to Empires games with every Sunday ”
22171	22177	22143	22144	Julian Hoult	39	“ the whole goddamned team . ”
22249	22261	22262	22262	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah , I can probably imagine your dad ’s reaction , ”
22280	22294	22275	22275	he	1603	“ What about you though ? How ’s your spin - off going ? ”
22295	22301	22275	22275	he	1603	“ My spin - off ? ”
22302	22319	22320	22320	Emmett	1603	“ Your restaurant . I figured you opened it to drive business back to the warehouse , ”
22328	22368	22323	22323	I	0	“ Yes . That ’s … exactly why I opened it , actually . Thank you for getting that . My parents were so upset that I did n’t just dunk all my money into sprucing up the warehouse . ”
22541	22556	22557	22557	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah , I remember the warehouse doing … not so great for awhile , ”
22568	22582	22557	22557	Emmett	1603	“ I used to overhear my dad talking to yours on the phone . ”
22583	22603	22604	22604	I	0	“ It ’s okay . Everyone knew we were struggling . They were just merciful and pretended not to , ”
22736	22751	22752	22752	Emmett	1603	“ So four years ago . That was when he finally bit the bullet ? ”
22755	22798	22799	22799	I	0	“ Yeah , he knew he had to sell , but he hated knowing he ’d be selling to a competitor . He was like , ‘ They wo n’t keep the name and we ’ll just get wiped from history , ’ ”
22806	22810	22799	22799	I	0	“ So dramatic . ”
22811	22826	22799	22799	I	0	“ Well , that company was his pride and joy . Even I remember . ”
22827	22870	22799	22799	I	0	“ Yeah . His pride , his joy – the bane of his whole existence . I mean I did get it . I knew it hurt most because he wanted to make my grandpa proud and keep our family name alive . ”
22871	22882	22883	22883	Emmett	1603	“ So you bought the company to keep it going , ”
22896	22899	22900	22900	I	0	“ Yep . ”
22920	22984	22900	22900	I	0	“ I already had savings and I spent the next year busting my ass , working nonstop and living as frugally as possible so I could scrounge up the money to buy the company from Dad . But it was n’t just buying the company I had to think about . I knew I needed something to revive the actual business , too . ”
22985	22994	22995	22995	Emmett	1603	“ And that was the restaurant , right ? ”
22998	23002	23003	23003	I	0	“ Sure was , ”
23159	23164	23127	23128	Bloody Mary	70	“ cool and relevant . ”

23231	23252	23218	23218	he	1603	“ So , do you ever plan on having a location that ’s open for more than just the summer ? ”
23253	23293	23294	23294	I	0	“ I ’d love to . And I ’ve thought about it a lot , but it would only make sense to do that in the city , and I just do n’t have the money for that yet , ”
23297	23310	23294	23294	I	0	“ And for now , I should concentrate on this first location . ”
23311	23334	23335	23335	Emmett	1603	“ I got ta be honest , I looked it up the other day and you ’ve got fuckin ’ killer reviews , ”
23345	23366	23367	23367	I	0	“ I mean your dad has to be … I do n’t know . Crazy happy ? Over the moon ? ”
23371	23382	23383	23383	I	0	“ Oh God , my dad is … embarrassingly proud , ”
23413	23416	23417	23417	I	0	“ Oh , ”

23513	23529	23530	23530	I	0	“ Dude . Why did you tell your mom you ’d be gone all summer ? ”
23538	23553	23530	23530	I	0	“ Because she was trying to set me up with her friends ’ daughters . ”
23554	23567	23568	23568	I	0	“ What , are they not pretty enough for your astronomical standards ? ”
23571	23576	23577	23577	Emmett	1603	“ They ’re pretty , ”
23588	23620	23577	23577	Emmett	1603	“ But if my mom ’s introducing me to someone , she ’s suggesting I start a relationship with her , and like I said , I do n’t do those . ”
23621	23634	23635	23635	I	0	“ Have you literally never been in a relationship since high school ? ”
23638	23648	23649	23649	Emmett	1603	“ No , I was in one during college , ”
23662	23672	23658	23658	I	0	“ And … it just was n’t any good ? ”
23673	23678	23658	23658	I	0	“ It was great . ”
23679	23688	23689	23689	I	0	“ What ? Then why did it end ? ”
23810	23821	23822	23822	he	1603	“ I just did n’t have the time for it , ”
23833	23838	23839	23839	he	1603	“ Any more questions ? ”
23849	23852	23839	23839	he	1603	“ No , ”

23980	23990	23991	23991	I	0	“ Well , apparently we went into extra innings , ”
23995	24007	23991	23991	I	0	“ Jennings hit the walk - off homer in the twelfth . ”
24008	24011	24012	24012	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah ? ”
24024	24030	24012	24012	Emmett	1603	“ Pull up the video . ”

24103	24115	24116	24116	I	0	“ Well , you can thank your owner brother for that , ”
24176	24185	24172	24172	I	0	“ I wish we saw that game live . ”

24223	24231	24232	24232	I	0	“ Dude . That movie kinda sucked , ”
24244	24249	24250	24250	he	1603	“ Yeah , dude , ”
24254	24259	24260	24260	I	0	“ It totally did . ”
24295	24297	24288	24288	I	0	“ dude ”
24353	24362	24363	24363	I	0	“ So … you going to your room ? ”

24391	24397	24386	24386	I	0	“ are you going to bed ”
24410	24423	24424	24424	Emmett	1603	“ What , do you want me to come to your room ? ”
24442	24447	24448	24448	I	0	“ You ’re funny , ”
24468	24471	24448	24448	I	0	“ Goodnight . ”
24490	24493	24481	24481	he	1603	“ Goodnight , ”
24589	24592	24583	24583	I	0	“ Omigod ! ”
24798	24801	24793	24793	Emmett	1603	“ Stop . ”
24809	24814	24802	24802	I	0	“ W - what ? ”
24825	24841	24818	24818	his	1603	“ Stop staring at my dick like you want to put it in your mouth . ”
24920	24923	24924	24924	He	1603	“ Aly . ”
24937	24945	24946	24946	he	1603	“ Why are you just standing there ? ”
25004	25012	25013	25013	he	1603	“ Do you want to touch it ? ”
25037	25048	25049	25049	he	1603	“ Because unless that ’s what you want , Aly , ”
25053	25065	25049	25049	he	1603	“ you better fucking turn around and go to your room . ”
25079	25084	25086	25087	an adult	1425	“ go to your room ”
25333	25351	25356	25356	his	1603	“ Unless you want this right now you better fucking turn around and go to your room . ”
25437	25440	25430	25430	I	0	“ Okay . ”
25471	25511	25512	25512	I	0	“ You do look miserable enough that I ’m going to spare you of like , eighty percent of the filthy questions I want to ask right now , because I know you do n’t want to hear it . ”
25522	25538	25539	25539	she	43	“ So , here ’s the deal . You have two options here , okay ? ”
25548	25597	25598	25598	I	0	“ One – you stop getting in your head and just fuck Emmett already . You know you want to , he knows you want to , so just leave the past in the past and let the man make it up to you in orgasms . Right ? ”
25601	25664	25598	25598	I	0	“ Wrong . Even if I were able to miraculously forget the past and sleep with him , we ’d still have to consider that it could get awkward or complicated between us , which could result in me having to move out , which we are still very much trying to avoid because how are you and Mike by the way ? ”
25665	25698	25699	25699	Evie	43	“ We fooled around last night but when I touched his dick , he put my hand back in my lap . At which point my soul died and we started fighting , ”
25711	25731	25732	25732	she	43	“ So yeah , point taken . No fucking Emmett and no sex for either of us . Yippee , ”
25743	25776	25740	25740	she	43	“ Wait . What the hell am I talking about ? Just because you ca n’t fuck Emmett does n’t mean you ca n’t fuck any of the other babes in town ! ”
25777	25787	25788	25788	I	0	“ Yeah , but we ’ve been over this , ”
25791	25824	25788	25788	I	0	“ I ’m not hitting the club again , I do n’t trust Tinder and I ’m not going to date any of our ‘ cute regulars ’ because that looks unprofessional . ”
25825	25844	25845	25845	Evie	43	“ So what , we just have to pray that some miracle hottie just lands in your lap ? ”
25861	25865	25866	25866	Evie	43	“ Holy shit ! ”
25869	25876	25877	25877	I	0	“ Hannah ! What ’s up ? ”
25889	25894	25895	25895	Hannah	90	“ I ’m sorry , ”
25908	25923	25902	25902	she	43	“ I just – there ’s a guy outside asking for you , Aly . ”
25928	25931	25902	25902	she	43	“ Who ? ”
25932	25965	25902	25902	she	43	“ I do n’t know his name . I just know that he ’s really hot and a bunch of paparazzi followed him here . They ’re taking pictures through the window . ”
25966	25969	25973	25973	Evie	43	“ What ? ”
26115	26120	26121	26121	he	495	“ Aly , right ? ”
26124	26137	26121	26121	he	495	“ It ’s nice to meet you . I ’m Drew Maddox . ”
26386	26389	26390	26390	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
26481	26486	26487	26487	I	0	“ Ah , Christ … ”
26853	26856	26857	26857	His	298	“ Emmett . ”
26870	26879	26857	26857	His	298	“ Is this a fucking joke , Maddox ? ”
26880	26920	26846	26846	his	298	“ No , this is me being petty because you missed the party I threw for Iain . Also , I tried the lobster roll at Ellie ’s restaurant – it ’s fucking amazing . Have you had it ? ”
26921	26951	26857	26857	His	298	“ Her name is Aly , jackass , and you do realize I ’ll fucking kill you if you lay so much as a finger on her , right ? ”
26952	26973	26857	26857	His	298	“ Well , I value my life so I ’ll just have tantric sex with her . How about that ? ”
26974	26977	26846	26846	his	298	“ Drew – ”
26978	26998	26999	26999	I	0	“ You should n’t have waited so long to make a move , Emmett . You snooze you lose . ”
27044	27053	27038	27038	Aly	43	“ Emmett ! What the hell are you – ”
27054	27063	27064	27064	I	0	“ Where did you even meet Drew today ? ”
27067	27075	27076	27076	Aly	43	“ Did he come into the restaurant ? ”
27096	27104	27090	27090	she	43	“ Why does it matter , Emmett ? ”
27119	27135	27105	27105	Her	43	“ You and I have an agreement , remember ? We ’re supposed to be – ”
27136	27144	27145	27145	I	0	“ Friends . Yeah . I know , ”
27158	27176	27145	27145	I	0	“ But for friends , we ’ve definitely seen each other naked way too many fucking times . ”
27177	27182	27183	27183	Aly	43	“ Emmett , please , ”
27208	27235	27195	27195	she	43	“ You know I ca n’t do this with you . You said that if I lived here , we ’d be platonic – you promised . ”
27236	27250	27145	27145	I	0	“ What ’s platonic about you staring last night instead of walking away ? ”
27251	27267	27195	27195	she	43	“ What ’s normal about changing with the door open when you have a roommate ? ”
27268	27295	27195	27195	she	43	“ I ’ve lived alone my whole fucking adult life , Aly , sorry I have n’t changed every one of my habits for you yet . ”
27296	27305	27306	27306	she	505	“ You ’re being an asshole right now , ”
27309	27316	27317	27317	I	0	“ And you ’re in denial , ”
27320	27362	27317	27317	I	0	“ You want me just as badly as I want you . You ’re only going on a date with Drew to get me out of your head . I ’ve seen girls do it before and you ’re no different . ”
27363	27383	27317	27317	I	0	“ Emmett , please do n’t talk like you know anything about me anymore , because you do n’t ! ”
27384	27426	27427	27427	I	0	“ No shit , Aly , that ’s why it ’s fucking killing me that you ’re about to spend a night talking to Drew and telling him everything I ’ve been dying to know about you for twelve fucking years , ”
27460	27521	27450	27450	she	506	“ I want to know where you ’ve been , what you ’ve done – I want to know everything I can about you , Aly , because all I know right now is the fact that you wo n’t let yourself be with me despite the fact that you want me , and it ’s driving me fucking insane ! ”
27522	27531	27532	27532	Aly	43	“ What if I do n’t want you ? ”
27536	27542	27543	27543	I	0	“ I know you do , ”
27547	27576	27577	27577	I	0	“ Aside from the fact that I saw it last night , I saw it the night at the club . Did you already forget what happened then ? ”
27591	27683	27684	27684	I	0	“ Because if you did let me remind you that you looked at me like you wanted me to fuck you right in that bathroom . You came home with me , you straddled me and you begged me for more of everything I did to that perfect fucking body of yours , so if you want to tell me that you do n’t want me , then at least explain that night to me . Because I do n’t think I ’d ever felt a wetter pussy in my life , ”
27745	27748	27749	27749	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
27937	27946	27936	27936	ALY	43	“ Are you fucking kidding me , Aly ? ”

28003	28025	27986	27986	he	1603	“ Do you want me to punish you for staring at my cock last night ? Is that what you want ? ”
28026	28029	27986	27986	he	1603	“ No ! ”
28030	28039	28040	28040	He	1603	“ Then why were you watching that video ? ”
28048	28066	28067	28067	he	1603	“ Why were you watching fucking roommate porn if you do n’t want me to fuck you ? ”
28070	28074	28075	28075	Wildfire	93	“ Tell me . ”
28159	28167	28168	28168	Emmett	1603	“ Just admit that you want me , ”
28187	28194	28179	28179	he	1603	“ I do n’t , Emmett ! ”
28206	28215	28179	28179	he	1603	“ So just get out of my room ! ”
28216	28226	28227	28227	he	1603	“ Why ? So you can touch your pussy ? ”
28242	28266	28238	28238	he	1603	“ So you can make yourself come while I jack off down the hall ? Is that what you want to do again ? ”
28323	28327	28314	28314	he	1603	“ Fuck you , ”
28464	28470	28471	28471	I	0	“ Kiss me somewhere else , ”

28811	28819	28820	28820	He	1603	“ Tell me how good it feels . ”
28830	28835	28820	28820	He	1603	“ It feels good , ”
28851	28866	28820	28820	He	1603	“ Dammit , Emmett , do n’t stop – it feels so fucking good . ”

31268	31296	31297	31297	I	0	“ Are you really trying to dare me into staying , Emmett ? Because I ’m not thirteen anymore , and it ’s not going to work , ”

31572	31587	31588	31588	Emmett	1603	“ This is far enough , Aly – just fucking talk to me already , ”
31628	31646	31647	31647	I	0	“ What is it ? Huh ? What are you leaving for ? Just tell me that . ”
31661	31686	31687	31687	I	0	“ If you really need to know , Emmett , it ’s because I woke up this morning and felt like shit about myself , ”
31704	31784	31785	31785	I	0	“ I cried in the bathroom for ten minutes because as good as I felt last night , I felt stupid this morning . I remembered the fact that I do n’t trust you , Emmett . Every time I think long enough about you , I feel angry . I feel embarrassed and stupid and lonely , so even if I did want you , in what world would it make sense for me to be with you ? ”
31792	31797	31785	31785	I	0	“ Answer me that . ”

31824	31909	31818	31818	he	1603	“ You think I ’m the enemy , Aly , but if you just take a second to remember everything that happened twelve years ago instead of running from it and sticking to whatever story you made up in your head , you ’ll know that as much as I fucked with you in high school , I ’m not the one who ’s really your problem . I ’m not the one who ruined everything . You just want it to be me . ”
31914	31917	31918	31918	I	0	“ No . ”
31924	31933	31918	31918	I	0	“ That ’s not true , that ’s – ”
31948	31962	31936	31936	I	0	“ You know what , I ca n’t talk right now , Emmett , ”
31978	32006	32007	32007	Emmett	1603	“ No , you wo n’t talk about this – now or ever , because you do n’t like thinking about how I ’m just your scapegoat , ”
32014	32038	32007	32007	Emmett	1603	“ You do n’t like thinking about how it ’s easier to blame me and let the real asshole off scot - free . ”
32092	32137	32138	32138	Emmett	1603	“ You lied to yourself all these years , Aly , and I let you because I knew you were hurting . I figured I might as well let you believe what you wanted , because I was never going to see you again , ”
32142	32185	32186	32186	he	1603	“ But now that you ’re here , I can say it – I ’m not the one who made your life miserable . It was n’t me , and fuck it , I ’m done letting you pretend that it was , ”
32285	32290	32276	32276	I	0	“ Evie … no , ”
32315	32322	32295	32295	she	564	“ Seriously . I ca n’t . ”
32323	32328	32329	32329	she	564	“ Except you can , ”
32336	32341	32342	32342	she	564	“ And you will , ”
32408	32429	32393	32393	I	0	“ I mean you have to look good , Aly . You ’re going on a date with Jude Maddox . ”

32435	32463	32464	32464	Evie	43	“ Whatever . If he ’s the type to draw paparazzi , you need to be camera ready , and nothing says camera ready like red soles , ”
32477	32487	32468	32468	Mike	44	“ Evie ! Are we out of frozen pizzas ? ”
32488	32491	32492	32492	I	0	“ Yes ! ”
32501	32514	32496	32496	Mike	44	“ Dude . What am I supposed to eat for dinner then ? ”
32536	32579	32580	32580	Evie	43	“ Please refrain from dude - ing me , Michael – I sent you a text that said ‘ remember frozen pizzas ’ when you were at the grocery store ! So do n’t talk to me about your dinner – okay ? ”
32596	32599	32600	32600	she	43	“ See ? ”
32605	32669	32600	32600	she	43	“ If you had any doubts about why you need to go out tonight , it ’s because one day you might spend your Friday arguing with your fiancé about frozen pizzas . So before that happens , you better have all the fun in the world , and that starts with you looking happy that you ’ve got this severely hot date . ”
32670	32677	32600	32600	she	43	“ I know . I just … ”
32894	32906	32907	32907	Evie	43	“ Aly ? You said you wanted this dress , right ? ”

34225	34249	34250	34250	Drew	298	“ I did n’t even realize it was you ! Omigod ! Who would ’ve guessed that you could clean up so well ? ”
34258	34265	34250	34250	Drew	298	“ Thanks . I ’m sure . ”
34266	34276	34277	34277	Britt	75	“ Oh , it ’s a compliment ! Duh , ”
34296	34333	34334	34334	She	599	“ So funny that you ’re here because E and I were just saying how we ’re the only two who have n’t eaten yet . So if you ’ve got extra room at your table … ”
34347	34363	34334	34334	She	599	“ Wink , wink . Hint , hint . What do you say , Drewy ? ”

35118	35124	35125	35125	Drew	298	“ Whoa . You alright ? ”
35140	35147	35134	35134	he	298	“ Christ . You ’re jiggling . ”
35170	35184	35167	35167	Drew	298	“ I was talking about your knee , but yeah . That too . ”

35371	35382	35383	35383	she	75	“ Excuse me , I do believe I was talking , ”
35429	35441	35442	35442	she	75	“ Babe . You ’re gon na wanna hear this part , ”
35446	35474	35475	35475	she	75	“ It ’s the part where I got a little too drunk after the mezcal tour and skinny dipped in the pool – in front of everyone , ”
35498	35508	35509	35509	he	298	“ Hey . So I need to confess something , ”
35572	35584	35585	35585	Drew	298	“ I ’m kind of only here to be a dick , ”
35595	35598	35599	35599	He	298	“ What ? ”
35631	35658	35624	35624	his	298	“ Yeah , so I ’m pretty sure you know this since you two have been eye - banging all night , but Emmett wants you . ”
35672	35677	35678	35678	I	0	“ Like … bad . ”
35681	35692	35693	35693	I	0	“ I , um … yes . I do know . ”
35712	35729	35730	35730	I	0	“ So , you ’re here because what ? You just want to fuck with him ? ”
35740	35754	35755	35755	he	298	“ Yeah . That ’s pretty much what we do to each other , ”
35758	35763	35764	35764	he	298	“ Though , actually , ”
35768	35798	35799	35799	he	298	“ I am here to enjoy the fact that you ’re my date , ‘ cause you do look beautiful and that dress is … pretty fuckin ’ killer , ”
35826	35892	35821	35821	he	298	“ But that said , I ’m not actually trying to take you home tonight . Unless Emmett magically loses interest in you , which … I assure you he wo n’t … I ’m just here to torture him as payback for some petty shit . That make any sense or did I drink too much ? ‘ Cause I just drank a lot . ”
35905	35923	35924	35924	I	0	“ Um … I think that makes some sense . Why are you drinking so fast though ? ”
35927	35943	35944	35944	he	298	“ ’Cause that ’s what it takes to survive a night with this Beth chick , ”
35952	35967	35944	35944	he	298	“ So bottoms up . ‘ Cause she ’s still going on about Oaxaca . ”
35989	36021	36022	36022	Britt	75	“ Oh my God , it was amazing . Actually , I still have some distributor contacts in case you ’re interested in carrying their mezcal at your restaurant , Aly , ”
36028	36031	36022	36022	Britt	75	“ Oh . ”
36046	36081	36082	36082	I	0	“ Well , that ’s really kind of you but I feel like most of the booze people seem to want at the restaurant is wine , beer and Bloody Marys on the weekend , ”
36096	36103	36104	36104	I	0	“ But hey , who knows , ”
36107	36135	36104	36104	I	0	“ Maybe I ’ll order some for my dad . He loves mezcal . I should definitely have at least a bottle for the day he visits . ”
36147	36165	36142	36142	she	75	“ You ’ve been open for more than three months and your dad has n’t visited yet ? ”
36171	36186	36166	36166	Her	75	“ Is n’t opening your first restaurant kind of a big deal for you ? ”
36187	36190	36191	36191	I	0	“ Oh . ”
36206	36215	36191	36191	I	0	“ Yes . It is a big deal . ”
36216	36224	36166	36166	Her	75	“ Does your dad live far away ? ”
36225	36231	36232	36232	I	0	“ I ’d say so , ”
36272	36280	36263	36263	my	0	“ What state does he live in ? ”
36281	36315	36191	36191	I	0	“ Oh , he ’s … not out of state . He lives in New York . In Brooklyn . But you know , it ’s more than a two hour drive away . ”
36316	36346	36347	36347	Britt	75	“ Pshhh , that ’s nothing when it comes to visiting your own daughter ! Especially when she ’s at like , a huge turning point in her life , ”
36350	36383	36347	36347	Britt	75	“ But maybe that ’s just me ? I ’m just like , so close to my dad . I ca n’t even imagine him not wanting to visit me if I – ”
36384	36387	36388	36388	Emmett	1603	“ Hey . ”
36402	36419	36420	36420	he	1603	“ Why do n’t you stop talking about that ? Recommend me another drink or something , ”
36426	36432	36420	36420	he	1603	“ Ooh ! You bet ! ”
36464	36485	36451	36451	she	75	“ I ’m really sorry about your dad , Aly . It sucks that he just refuses to see you . ”
36641	36643	36634	36634	Gon	109	“ sorry ”
36689	36696	36697	36697	Drew	298	“ What the hell was that ? ”
36716	36719	36709	36709	he	298	“ Nothing . ”
36764	36777	36778	36778	I	0	“ It was just … a low blow to piss me off , ”
36798	36811	36812	36812	I	0	“ Well , why do n’t we piss her off right back ? ”
36823	36829	36812	36812	I	0	“ What do you suggest ? ”
36830	36839	36840	36840	Drew	298	“ Something that requires pissing off Emmett too , ”
36843	36847	36840	36840	Drew	298	“ That okay ? ”
36856	36864	36853	36853	I	0	“ Do what you got ta do . ”
36929	36932	36915	36915	Drew	298	“ Drew . ”
36947	36957	36958	36958	he	298	“ Let me talk to you for a second , ”
36984	36993	36974	36974	He	298	“ Nah , bro , I ’m good , ”
37015	37019	37001	37001	He	298	“ He pissed ? ”
37020	37025	37026	37026	I	0	“ I think so , ”
37031	37037	37026	37026	I	0	“ How ‘ bout her ? ”
37038	37046	37001	37001	He	298	“ I – I do n’t know . ”
37047	37055	37056	37056	Drew	298	“ All good . I got this , ”
37076	37085	37086	37086	he	298	“ I get any salt on my lips ? ”
37156	37162	37163	37163	She	619	“ Get out . Please . ”
37187	37196	37197	37197	he	298	“ Whoa , hey – what ’s this ? ”
37289	37294	37295	37295	he	298	“ Meet me outside , ”
37305	37312	37295	37295	he	298	“ I ’m taking you home . ”
37345	37347	37335	37350	the same driver who ’d taken us home after we “ met ” at the club	623	“ met ”
37478	37492	37493	37493	I	0	“ Bet you did n’t know that he had n’t visited me yet , ”
37534	37541	37530	37530	he	1603	“ Pretty embarrassing to think about , ”
37551	37577	37578	37578	I	0	“ I did n’t want to make him the enemy because that would mean I ’d spent my life trying to please the bad guy , ”
37607	37647	37648	37648	I	0	“ I mean every decision I ’ve ever made – chopping my hair , rejecting girly stuff , copying everything you did for as long as I could – it was all in the hopes of winning his approval , ”
37668	37679	37648	37648	I	0	“ And God , I just hate to think it . ”
37694	37758	37687	37687	I	0	“ I hate to think that for the past four years , I ’ve busted my ass and dedicated my whole life to saving this company for nothing . Because I ’m pretty sure I only did it for a last shot at his approval . Just for the fighting chance that he might finally like me as much as he likes you . ”
37851	37866	37838	37838	Emmett	1603	“ I was never comfortable with it , Aly . None of us were . ”
37877	37900	37901	37901	Emmett	1603	“ We all saw the way he treated you , and trust me , we hated it . Me and Mom especially , ”
37904	37998	37901	37901	Emmett	1603	“ I hated that he came to my games instead of your plays . I hated the way he just lost interest in a conversation when you started talking . It was so fucked up and awkward . I mean as a kid , I ’m pretty sure I thought it was funny . But by the time I was in high school , I remember thinking it was weird that your dad was so obsessed with hearing about my teammates or whoever I was dating or anything going on in my life . ”
38021	38128	38015	38015	I	0	“ I knew something was screwed up , Aly . But our dads – they grew up together , and my dad could only see yours through rose - colored glasses . And I was a stupid , lazy kid so I just tried to ignore it . I did n’t bother myself with how you were probably hurting . It was too much trouble for me . The one time I talked to my dad about yours , he got pissed at me for being disrespectful , and I hated when he was mad at me . I did n’t know how to handle it . ”
38129	38166	38167	38167	I	0	“ Because you were n’t used to it . You were his favorite . You were everyone ’s favorite . You had no idea what it was like to be born into another person ’s shadow , ”
38184	38296	38176	38176	I	0	“ I never had a chance to be someone who mattered . Even in school with my closest friends , I felt like no one liked me for me . People only hung out with me to hear about you – what our vacations were like together , what you were like outside of school . When I went up to adults , they looked tired of me before I even started talking . They were just anticipating me complaining about something you did , some prank you pulled on me , and it annoyed them to have to discipline you . Because everyone loved you most . My dad included . ”
38340	38359	38360	38360	he	1603	“ I did n’t know . I had no idea it was this bad for you , Aly , ”
38367	38403	38360	38360	he	1603	“ Everything was just a joke to me then . I did n’t know what pain felt like . I could n’t empathize . I was a fucking idiot , and I ’m so sorry . ”
38439	38455	38456	38456	I	0	“ I hated that you gave him the excuse to finally get rid of me , ”
38502	38572	38492	38492	we	632	“ What you did that day … when you ratted me out . Somewhere in the back of my head , I knew you were right , but I convinced myself you only did it to torture me like you always did . You took away half my friends by hooking up with them – I figured you were just trying to take away another thing that I loved . ”
38573	38580	38581	38581	Emmett	1603	“ You did n’t love Scott , ”
38631	38649	38650	38650	I	0	“ Of course I did n’t love him , Emmett . I was just lonely . Constantly , ”
38667	38723	38650	38650	I	0	“ I did n’t have real friends . I did n’t have a dad who wanted to even look in my direction . My mom was constantly defending him . Mr. Scott was just … my first time experiencing someone who was interested in me . Someone who was actually interested in listening to me . ”
38747	38754	38745	38745	people	316	“ did n’t understand our bond . ”

39036	39074	39027	39027	Emmett	1603	“ He was a fucking predator and I still fantasize about beating the fucking shit out of him . Maybe I should have done it differently , but I ’ll never regret what I did that day . ”
39322	39354	39355	39355	he	42	“ You ’re going to stay with Aunt Carla for the summer . I ’ve got too much to worry about to handle you when you ’re this out of control , ”
39810	39816	39817	39817	I	0	“ He ’s not proud , ”
39827	39850	39820	39820	Emmett	1603	“ He ’s just embarrassed that his daughter did what he could n’t . And I think he hates me for it . ”
39851	39858	39859	39859	Emmett	1603	“ He does n’t hate you , ”
39871	39877	39878	39878	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
39888	39905	39878	39878	I	0	“ He definitely does n’t love me . I do n’t know if he ever did . ”

39955	40016	40017	40017	he	1603	“ You were a part of my life for as long as I can remember . All my best memories were with you . I know I messed with you a lot , but in the end , I always loved you , and I do n’t think I really knew it till that day I found you after school , ”
40030	40081	40017	40017	he	1603	“ And trust me , I ’ll never regret what I did that day , but I ’ll always regret the fact that I lost you after . I missed you so fucking much , Aly . I had no idea what you meant to me until you were gone . ”
40128	40139	40140	40140	I	0	“ Well , you ’ve got twelve years on me , ”
40145	40163	40140	40140	I	0	“ Because I do n’t think I knew what you meant to me until I came back . ”

41501	41507	41508	41508	he	1603	“ My fucking dream girl , ”
41663	41666	41646	41646	she	679	“ Easy , ”

42170	42179	42180	42180	she	679	“ You do n’t have to hold back , ”
42184	42190	42180	42180	she	679	“ I can take more . ”
42219	42222	42223	42223	Aly	38	“ More , ”
42281	42288	42271	42271	she	679	“ Tell me how that feels , ”
42304	42312	42289	42289	I	0	“ Does that feel good , baby ? ”
42313	42320	42321	42321	She	679	“ Yes … I think I … ”
42337	42347	42321	42321	She	679	“ Do it . Come for me , baby . ”

43052	43062	43046	43046	I	0	“ Emmett . You ’ve been ignoring my calls , ”
43091	43146	43079	43079	she	41	“ You know , I ’ll give you some credit for texting me to let me know that you are in New York this summer , but at some point , I ’d expect you to call and explain why you lied about being away . To your own mother . Who loves you . ”
43171	43211	43157	43157	I	0	“ I do n’t know , Ma . I think it might ’ve been the two - page list of friends ’ daughters that you emailed me . Got ta say , that was a bit of a buzzkill . ”
43212	43255	43157	43157	I	0	“ I was n’t telling you to show all of them around , I just thought you ’d pick one or two to meet if the dates of their visits matched up with your availability . What ’s so hard about that ? ”
43256	43266	43267	43267	I	0	“ Nothing . Everything . I do n’t know . ”
43282	43308	43309	43309	Mom	41	“ The real question is why you even believed that I ’d be gone that long . I ’ve never just upped and done that . ”
43316	43342	43309	43309	Mom	41	“ I do n’t know , Emmett . I just assumed that maybe you ’d finally gotten tired of everything and just … run off . ”
43354	43378	43309	43309	Mom	41	“ Honestly , a part of me hoped that you were really leaving for that long , because Lord knows you deserve it . ”
43379	43382	43309	43309	Mom	41	“ Stop . ”
43383	43431	43309	43309	Mom	41	“ I do mean it though , Emmett . As your mother , it would make me happy if I knew you could spend even a few weeks away . Just so you can get a breather . You could go to a resort or maybe some – ”
43432	43435	43436	43436	I	0	“ Ma , ”
43439	43443	43444	43444	She	41	“ New subject . ”
43448	43454	43455	43455	she	41	“ Fine , moving on , ”
43472	43484	43455	43455	she	41	“ How ’s Aly ? Are you two getting along okay ? ”
43521	43524	43512	43512	she	41	“ cool off ”
43592	43602	43583	43583	Aly	38	“ She and I are getting along just fine , ”
43614	43661	43603	43603	I	0	“ I feel bad that I promised her the house to herself and now you two are spending the summer under the same roof . Especially since you had that little falling out . I know it ’s never quite been the same between you since . ”
43663	43665	43603	43603	I	0	“ little ”
43884	43905	43906	43906	Mom	41	“ Well , if your roommate situation is peachy , that ’s one less thing for me to worry about , ”
43909	43940	43906	43906	Mom	41	“ Anyway , now that I know you are not in the Maldives , will you be making it to the game this Sunday ? Gram misses you and Ozzy . ”
43941	43945	43946	43946	I	0	“ Of course , ”
44025	44028	44029	44029	Mom	41	“ Perfect , ”
44032	44054	44029	44029	Mom	41	“ And feel free to bring Aly . I do n’t think she ’s watched the game from our suite yet . ”
44055	44073	44074	44074	I	0	“ Sounds good . But I thought I was n’t allowed to bring girls to Sunday games , ”
44077	44100	44101	44101	Mom	41	“ Well , Sunday is a family day , so no bringing girls unless they ’re serious girlfriends . You know that , ”
44104	44135	44136	44136	I	0	“ But Aly is different . I know she ’ll never be your girlfriend – Lord , I wish – but she ’ll always be a part of the family . ”
44226	44241	44223	44223	me	0	“ Anyway , Ma , I got ta go . Someone ’s calling me . ”
44242	44246	44247	44247	I	0	“ A girl ? ”
44261	44266	44247	44247	I	0	“ It ’s Britt . ”
44267	44272	44273	44273	Mom	41	“ Oh . Her , ”
44277	44297	44273	44273	Mom	41	“ That reminds me , you do need a date for the gala next week . Not her though . ”
44298	44301	44302	44302	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
44306	44341	44302	44302	I	0	“ I mean it , Emmett . You ’re hosting it , so you can not show up solo . Not unless you want me and all my friends pushing their daughters on you . ”
44342	44347	44348	44348	I	0	“ Alright , Mom , ”
44372	44379	44380	44380	I	0	“ I have to go though , ”
44399	44421	44392	44392	I	0	“ Shit . I just realized I ’m supposed to have a meeting with Britt about the gala today . Fuck . ”
44422	44425	44392	44392	I	0	“ Language . ”
44426	44429	44430	44430	I	0	“ Sorry , ”
44433	44451	44430	44430	I	0	“ I got ta go though . Love you , Ma . Tell Gram I say hi . ”
44452	44463	44464	44464	Mom	41	“ Love you too , Emmett , and will do , ”
44491	44515	44516	44516	I	0	“ Please pick up the next time I call though , alright ? And give my grandkid a hug for me . Bye . ”
44536	44541	44528	44528	I	0	“ Grandma says hi . ”
44545	44547	44544	44544	herself	41	“ Grandma ”
44575	44587	44566	44566	he	440	“ Well ? Are we going to see Grandma or not ? ”
44853	44856	44845	44845	her	41	“ Shit . ”
45146	45161	45162	45162	Evie	43	“ I ’d exchange assignments with you , but you know the answers better , ”
45227	45277	45278	45278	she	43	“ Also , you do n’t deserve to have the best sex of your life and get all your work done for you the next morning . That ’s entirely too much good fortune in a short period of time , and we do n’t want to spoil you , ”
45293	45329	45278	45278	she	43	“ Seriously though , can you give me the details of how he made you come with just the head of his dick ? I need to know the logistics of that . For science . ”
45330	45362	45363	45363	I	0	“ First off , no . Second , can you not talk about his dick so loudly in front of our staff ? I think that might be blatant sexual harassment , ”
45408	45415	45416	45416	Evie	43	“ Okay , I ’ll whisper , ”
45419	45438	45416	45416	Evie	43	“ So , like , was he using his dick like a vibrator against your clit , or – ”
45439	45442	45443	45443	I	0	“ Evie ! ”
45446	45454	45455	45455	I	0	“ How was your night last night ? ”
45459	45482	45483	45483	Evie	43	“ Oof . Talk about a boner - killer . Well , as you know , we were out of frozen pizzas , ”
45492	45566	45567	45567	Evie	43	“ But we did agree on something the therapist emailed us . He said something about how Mike and I need to hang out together with each other ’s friends , because watching your significant other interact with other people is supposed to remind you of what you love about them or whatever . So whenever you and Emmett are ready , I ’ve got a double date with your names on it , ”
45575	45588	45572	45572	she	43	“ Unless you ’re still recovering from last night ’s double date . ”
45589	45597	45572	45572	she	43	“ It was definitely … a doozy . ”
45598	45618	45619	45619	Evie	43	“ Yeah , I ’d think so , because it ’s got you using the word ‘ doozy , ’ ”
45622	45641	45619	45619	Evie	43	“ I want to thoroughly make fun of you for that but I ’ll give you a break . ”
45642	45649	45650	45650	I	0	“ How weirdly merciful of you , ”
45653	45670	45650	45650	I	0	“ Well . I figure you ’re gon na need it considering who just walked in . ”
45756	45763	45764	45764	Evie	43	“ You ’re safe for now , ”
45770	45779	45764	45764	Evie	43	“ Though I can feel her cattiness brewing . ”
45849	45855	45856	45856	she	43	“ Good morning , ladies , ”
45945	45955	45956	45956	Evie	43	“ Morning , Britt . Hitting the club soon ? ”
45980	46011	45967	45967	Britt	75	“ Oh , this thing ? No , no club for me , doll . I ’m actually going to have a meeting with Emmett here in about twenty minutes . ”
46074	46082	46083	46083	Britt	75	“ It ’s for Emmett ’s gala , ”
46091	46097	46098	46098	Evie	43	“ Ooh . What gala ? ”
46121	46131	46132	46132	she	43	“ Why , Aly , that sounds very fancy , ”
46142	46184	46185	46185	she	43	“ Oh , you ’re so cute ! Yes , I guess you could call it ‘ fancy . ’ It is black tie , so you ’ll definitely have to save up a few paychecks for your dress , Aly , ”
46235	46248	46249	46249	Britt	75	“ I mean we ’re definitely going all out for this one , ”
46261	46274	46275	46275	she	43	“ The cause means a lot to him , as you know , ”
46285	46304	46275	46275	she	43	“ Or maybe you do n’t know . Do you know what the gala ’s for this year ? ”
46316	46336	46313	46313	she	43	“ It ’s for heart disease . Because his dad died of a heart attack when he was eighteen . ”
46337	46344	46313	46313	she	43	“ Yes . I know that . ”
46345	46363	46364	46364	I	0	“ Really ? Were you at the funeral ? Because I do n’t think I saw you . ”
46371	46380	46381	46381	I	0	“ You were at Uncle George ’s funeral ? ”
46387	46393	46394	46394	Britt	75	“ I mean – George . ”
46400	46416	46394	46394	Britt	75	“ Wow . Your families are so close you call his parents aunt and uncle ? ”
46436	46439	46433	46433	I	0	“ Yes . ”
46440	46487	46488	46488	I	0	“ Yikes . Then why did n’t you go to the funeral ? Emmett was such a mess that day . It was so , so sad . I mean – to have your father and grandpa die within days of each other ? So horrible . ”
46549	46567	46568	46568	she	75	“ Poor thing . His life , his whole family – it was such a horrible mess , ”
46587	46608	46581	46581	she	75	“ But hey , look at him now ! Sexy , successful and sleeping with a new girl every week . ”
46616	46627	46628	46628	Evie	43	“ Wonder what adventures next week will bring . Right ? ”
46631	46648	46649	46649	she	75	“ Something tells me he might ’ve just found a girl to stick with for awhile , ”
46660	46682	46683	46683	Britt	75	“ Oh , bless your heart . You do n’t know about his ten - day rule then , do you ? ”
46686	46702	46683	46683	Britt	75	“ Do n’t worry . Just ask him – he ’s pretty open about it . ”
46703	46709	46710	46710	Evie	43	“ Totally . Will do , ”
46814	46817	46808	46808	Emmett	1603	“ horrible mess ”
46928	46933	46934	46934	Britt	75	“ Oh , look ! ”
46937	46943	46934	46934	Britt	75	“ Speak of the devil . ”
46969	46979	46980	46980	she	43	“ Holy fuck – hot , hot , hot ! ”
47072	47075	47076	47076	he	1603	“ Hey , ”
47094	47097	47076	47076	he	1603	“ Hey . ”
47127	47135	47136	47136	I	0	“ How … are you this morning ? ”
47160	47167	47168	47168	he	1603	“ Great . Better than ever , ”
47175	47180	47181	47181	she	75	“ Ibuprofen works wonders , ”
47191	47213	47214	47214	she	75	“ Now that you ’re feeling ‘ better than ever , ’ Emmett , are you ready to start our meeting ? ”
47243	47255	47256	47256	he	1603	“ I ’m early . I ’ll meet you there soon , ”
47279	47289	47274	47274	he	1603	“ Sorry for being rude . I ’m Emmett . ”
47290	47307	47308	47308	she	75	“ Yes , Emmett Hoult . I ’m Evie . I ’ve heard all about you , ”

47343	47353	47308	47308	she	75	“ Mm , it ’s been a mixed bag . ”
47354	47359	47360	47360	I	0	“ Okay , Evie , ”
47372	47375	47376	47376	I	0	“ Hey , ”
47379	47384	47376	47376	I	0	“ What ’s up ? ”
47385	47396	47397	47397	he	1603	“ Wanna order sushi and watch the Empires game tonight ? ”
47400	47403	47404	47404	My	0	“ Oh . ”
47432	47437	47438	47438	I	0	“ Yeah . Okay , ”
47455	47466	47467	47467	He	1603	“ That sounds like … a nice , relaxing night . ”

47497	47503	47483	47483	he	1603	“ See you back home . ”
47504	47508	47509	47509	I	0	“ See you , ”
47549	47552	47553	47553	Evie	43	“ What ? ”
47573	47580	47561	47561	I	0	“ Was that weird just now ? ”
47581	47586	47587	47587	I	0	“ Was what weird ? ”
47700	47707	47695	47695	Evie	43	“ Aly … ? Still waiting . ”
47708	47726	47727	47727	I	0	“ Oh ! It ’s nothing . I mean I know this is gon na sound stupid , ”
47731	47746	47747	47747	I	0	“ But I just thought he ’d have … more to say to me ? ”
47755	47773	47747	47747	I	0	“ And be more excited to see me ? Oh God , I sound like an idiot . ”
47774	47778	47779	47779	Evie	43	“ Stop it , ”
47782	47803	47804	47804	I	0	“ You do n’t sound like an idiot . You ’re just over - thinking things because you like him . ”
47851	47886	47887	47887	Evie	43	“ He was totally excited to see you before . Do n’t hold it against him that he did n’t have an over - the - top reaction . Boys are just like that , ”
47890	47897	47898	47898	she	43	“ I mean Mike definitely is , ”
47912	47927	47898	47898	she	43	“ Was it what Britt just said ? About some ten - day rule ? ”
47928	47931	47932	47932	I	0	“ No , ”
47948	47978	47979	47979	I	0	“ Are you upset because you were expecting him to want to do something bigger than delivery and TV ? Like , were you expecting a more formal date ? ”
47982	47989	47979	47979	I	0	“ I do n’t think so . ”
48005	48030	48031	48031	She	43	“ I do n’t know , Aly … I guess it ’s just hard to follow a night like last night . You know ? ”
48034	48065	48066	48066	Teddy	39	“ Maybe he ’s tired . I mean the man did work last night . He pounded two orgasms outta you . I ’m sure that ’s no easy feat . ”
48075	48094	48095	48095	I	0	“ Okay , for the most part , I agree with you , but ya got ta stop , ”
48109	48132	48095	48095	I	0	“ We ’re gon na get sued for sexual harassment , so let ’s just … stop talking completely for a bit . ”
48133	48150	48151	48151	Evie	43	“ And what ? Listen to Britt fawn all over Emmett like a frickin ’ cornball ? ”
48171	48209	48156	48156	I	0	“ Emmett , you know I ’m going to be dressed to the nines for this party . I ’m gon na look so good you ’re gon na have to help me swat the men away . ”
48225	48233	48234	48234	Evie	43	“ You wanna work in the office ? ”
48240	48248	48237	48237	I	0	“ Yeah . Let ’s do it . ”
48363	48370	48355	48355	Emmett	1603	“ Hey . Right on time . ”
48371	48387	48388	48388	Emmett	1603	“ Actually , I ’m super late – there was some receipt drama at closing . ”
48430	48445	48423	48423	he	1603	“ All good . We ’ll just leave now to make up for it . ”
48449	48465	48446	48446	I	0	“ Wait – leave now ? I thought we were doing delivery and the game . ”
48466	48472	48473	48473	Emmett	1603	“ Did I say delivery ? ”
48494	48507	48446	48446	I	0	“ I … think , yes ? I mean you said sushi ... ”
48508	48534	48535	48535	he	1603	“ Right . And I already ordered some from my favorite spot in the city . It ’ll be waiting for us at my suite , ”
48548	48553	48554	48554	Emmett	1603	“ At the stadium , ”
48574	48585	48586	48586	I	0	“ Wait . We ’re … going to the city ? ”
48589	48598	48599	48599	Emmett	1603	“ To watch the game at Empire Stadium ? ”
48609	48612	48599	48599	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah , ”
48692	48695	48674	48674	He	1603	“ What ? ”
48696	48704	48705	48705	I	0	“ I – I do n’t know . ”
48710	48740	48705	48705	I	0	“ It ’s just … the city ’s more than two hours away . Is n’t it ? The game will be over by the time we get there . ”
48741	48756	48757	48757	Emmett	1603	“ It would be if we were taking a car , would n’t it ? ”
48768	48782	48760	48760	he	1603	“ Now come on . I got ta get us to our ride . ”
48910	48917	48918	48918	I	0	“ How is this your life ? ”
48932	48935	48918	48918	I	0	“ What ? ”
48936	48940	48941	48941	I	0	“ Never mind ! ”
49084	49095	49077	49077	I	0	“ Oh my God . I forgot there was more , ”
49227	49230	49231	49231	Emmett	1603	“ Aly . ”
49262	49274	49275	49275	he	1603	“ Can I steal you from the window for a sec ? ”
49288	49294	49275	49275	he	1603	“ Sure . You okay ? ”
49295	49328	49329	49329	My	0	“ Yeah , I ’ve just been waiting to put my hands all over you since I woke up this morning , and I do n’t think I can last any longer . ”
49338	49340	49333	49333	I	0	“ oh ”
49406	49409	49410	49410	he	1603	“ Hey , ”
49419	49422	49410	49410	he	1603	“ Hi . ”
49423	49440	49441	49441	Lord	759	“ Waiting for you to come home today was the longest eight hours of my life . ”
49566	49579	49580	49580	I	0	“ Yeah , I pretty much thought about you all day too , ”
49616	49619	49620	49620	I	0	“ Really ? ”
49623	49649	49650	49650	Emmett	1603	“ If you think that ’s anything I can help around you , then you still do n’t know how fucking crazy you make me , ”
49659	49685	49650	49650	Emmett	1603	“ You have no idea how much it hurt to have my meeting at your place today and have to keep my hands to myself . ”
49686	49698	49650	49650	Emmett	1603	“ Is that why you barely said bye when you left ? ”
49699	49728	49729	49729	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah . That and Britt was just asking me a million questions about you , and I felt like I had to get her out of there , ”
49752	49777	49778	49778	he	1603	“ Christ . I ca n’t stand not touching you , but touching you makes me want to rip all your fucking clothes off , ”
49843	49846	49847	49847	I	0	“ Easy , ”
49850	49869	49847	49847	I	0	“ Let me help you cool down with a question I just need to get off my chest . ”
49870	49877	49847	49847	I	0	“ Uh - oh . What ? ”
49878	49892	49893	49893	I	0	“ What ’s this ten - day rule Britt Heatherton told me about ? ”
49896	49901	49902	49902	Emmett	1603	“ Is it real ? ”
49909	49917	49918	49918	He	1603	“ Uh … yeah . It is . ”
49927	49951	49952	49952	I	0	“ Of course , you should know by now that you ’re the exception to any rule I ’ve ever made for myself . ”
49960	49963	49952	49952	I	0	“ Really . ”
49964	49967	49902	49902	Emmett	1603	“ Really . ”
49968	49998	49999	49999	I	0	“ And what other rules of yours have I broken ? Because I have to be honest , you do n’t really seem like a rules kind of guy , ”
50002	50024	49999	49999	I	0	“ Fair enough . I ’m not . But the few that I have , I ’ve already broken for you . ”
50025	50037	49952	49952	I	0	“ Ten - day thing aside , what else is there ? ”
50038	50043	50044	50044	Emmett	1603	“ The roommate thing , ”
50047	50109	50110	50110	Emmett	1603	“ I told myself when I was probably twenty years old that I ’d never live with someone again . My roommate in college … his name was Cam and he was such a slob . He ’d leave food everywhere and hook up with girls in my bed , so pretty much since him , I ’ve been flying solo . ”
50113	50120	50110	50110	Emmett	1603	“ Unless you count my boy . ”
50121	50136	50110	50110	Emmett	1603	“ Ozzy ? I think he ’s mad at me , by the way . ”
50137	50169	50110	50110	Emmett	1603	“ Nah . He just likes the option of being able to sleep on my bed if he wants . He ’s spoiled . But he ’ll get used to you . ”
50170	50174	50175	50175	I	0	“ I see , ”
50351	50354	50355	50355	I	0	“ Emmett , ”
50378	50381	50362	50362	he	1603	“ Emmett ! ”
50382	50391	50362	50362	he	1603	“ Sorry . Might be addicted to these . ”
50392	50397	50398	50398	I	0	“ I can tell , ”
50442	50453	50426	50426	Emmett	1603	“ Oh God , what are you doing to me ? ”
50454	50461	50462	50462	he	1603	“ This is what you get , ”
50465	50485	50486	50486	he	1603	“ For every time you walked around the house without a bra on , I dreamt of doing this , ”
50500	50511	50495	50495	I	0	“ But I usually wore a bra around the house , ”
50519	50529	50512	50512	I	0	“ Usually . But the times you did n’t … ”
50530	50535	50558	50558	Emmett	1603	“ You could tell ? ”
50536	50557	50558	50558	Emmett	1603	“ Yes . From the shape . The way you bounced . I think you gave me a new fetish , ”
50608	50636	50637	50637	Emmett	1603	“ The night we watched that movie … these were so fucking hard I just wanted to rip your shirt off and suck on them all night , ”
50711	50722	50706	50706	his	1603	“ Have you ever come from having your nipples sucked ? ”
50731	50748	50749	50749	Emmett	1603	“ The only time I almost did was with you . The night after the club . ”
50758	50761	50762	50762	he	1603	“ Almost ? ”
51100	51103	51085	51085	he	1603	“ Um . ”
51115	51125	51104	51104	I	0	“ So … wow . Definitely my first nipplegasm , ”
51235	51245	51246	51246	I	0	“ Oh God , Emmett , I tortured you , ”
51267	51281	51282	51282	he	1603	“ It ’s not complete torture if I got to make you come , ”
51296	51316	51282	51282	he	1603	“ Yeah , do n’t do that . yet . I , uh … I just need a minute . ”
51317	51322	51323	51324	Poor guy	775	“ Omigod . Okay . ”
51668	51678	51659	51659	I	0	“ Fucking hell . What are you doing here ? ”
51679	51693	51694	51694	Julian	39	“ I own the stadium , asshole . Good to see you too , ”
51730	51733	51734	51734	he	39	“ Aly , ”
51741	51766	51734	51734	he	39	“ Christ , it ’s been forever . I take it Emmett ’s been tolerable if you ’re choosing to join him this evening . ”
51767	51776	51777	51777	Aly	43	“ Yes , he has . Hi Julian , ”
51845	51850	51827	51827	she	391	“ I ’m pregnant ! ”
51858	51863	51851	51851	I	0	“ No fucking way , ”
51874	51887	51888	51888	Sara	391	“ I ’m sorry , I just had to get it out , ”
51909	51912	51903	51903	He	39	“ What ? ”
51913	51916	51917	51917	Sara	391	“ Nothing , ”
51930	51933	51924	51924	Julian	39	“ Yeah ? ”
51947	51959	51924	51924	Julian	39	“ You two literally could n’t be more suspicious right now . ”
51960	51984	51924	51924	Julian	39	“ You could n’t be more suspicious right now . Now get out of my suite , I ’m here with my woman . ”
51985	51989	51990	51990	Julian	39	“ Your woman ? ”
52056	52073	52074	52074	he	39	“ Are you serious , Emmett ? This is everything I told you not to do . ”
52095	52102	52103	52103	I	0	“ I do n’t know man , ”
52106	52111	52103	52103	I	0	“ Let me live . ”
52112	52118	52103	52103	I	0	“ How did this happen ? ”
52119	52144	52145	52145	Julian	39	“ It just did , ca n’t explain it . Hey , how are you and Sara , by the way ? Anything new ? ”
52196	52204	52205	52205	he	39	“ Did she say something to you ? ”
52208	52220	52205	52205	he	39	“ No . What would she say if she said something ? ”
52253	52256	52257	52257	he	39	“ Fuck , ”
52286	52312	52274	52274	He	39	“ I think she ’s pregnant . But she has n’t said anything yet , and I do n’t want to get my hopes up . ”
52373	52410	52411	52411	Julian	39	“ I do n’t know , man . If she is , she is . If she ’s not , she ’s not . But it would definitely be cool for Ozzy to have a cousin . ”
52414	52445	52411	52411	Julian	39	“ Right . I guess I should temper my kid ’s expectations of ever having a human cousin . Sara has no siblings and you … are who you are . ”
52446	52465	52466	52466	Julian	39	“ I ’m not entirely sure what you mean by that but I do think I ’m offended . ”
52469	52516	52466	52466	Julian	39	“ You realize you ca n’t let Mom find out about anything going on between you and Aly , right ? She ’s going to get so ahead of herself she ’ll probably have to be hospitalized for heartbreak if and when you two break up . ”
52517	52539	52540	52540	Julian	39	“ Jesus fuck , take it easy . And Aly is n’t going anywhere , alright ? I promise you that . ”
52595	52607	52608	52608	he	39	“ I know how much she ’s always meant to you , ”
52643	52671	52672	52672	I	0	“ I mean you definitely had a shitty way of showing it then , but here ’s to hoping that you can make up for it now . ”
52677	52687	52688	52688	I	0	“ That was actually really nice for your standards , ”
52694	52708	52688	52688	I	0	“ Yeah , well . Like you said , I ’m getting soft . ”
52709	52738	52688	52688	I	0	“ Definitely . On that topic , remind me that I owe Sara a million beers for making you that much more tolerable since you ’ve been together . ”
52739	52752	52753	52753	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’ll remind you in nine months , hopefully . ”
52810	52819	52820	52820	I	0	“ Julian ’s going to be a dad , ”
52840	52853	52857	52857	she	391	“ Oh my God . Your mom ’s going to freak out ! ”
52864	52868	52869	52869	I	0	“ Holy shit , ”
52954	52961	52962	52962	I	0	“ Man . He needed this , ”
52975	52993	52962	52962	I	0	“ He really did . He ’s been waiting to be a dad for a long time . ”
52994	52997	52998	52998	Aly	43	“ Seriously ? ”
53001	53031	53032	53032	I	0	“ I mean I remember him always being good with kids , but I also remember him saying that he was ‘ a hundred percent never having children . ’ ”
53040	53056	53032	53032	I	0	“ Yeah , well . I think he changed his mind after our dad died . ”
53062	53065	53066	53066	She	43	“ Oh . ”
53080	53087	53066	53066	She	43	“ I guess that makes sense . ”
53088	53091	53092	53092	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
53142	53145	53146	53146	I	0	“ What ? ”
53149	53154	53155	53155	she	43	“ I feel bad , ”
53159	53163	53155	53155	she	43	“ For what ? ”
53164	53183	53184	53184	I	0	“ For not being there when your dad died . For not knowing your grandpa died right after . ”
53269	53280	53281	53281	he	42	“ This is why I ’m grateful for Charlie Stanton , ”
53285	53342	53281	53281	he	42	“ He ’s visited Grandpa more than your aunts and uncles have . He sends flowers . He ’s been here for me the way my real brothers and sisters have n’t been , and that ’s why you , me – all the Hoults will treat him like blood . Always . No matter what . ”
53434	53450	53451	53451	Aly	43	“ Honestly , I think I learned what family was from yours more than mine , ”
53461	53484	53451	53451	Aly	43	“ In some ways , I ca n’t blame my dad for idolizing your family so much . You guys were perfect . ”
53485	53491	53492	53492	Aly	43	“ Until we were n’t . ”
53510	53535	53536	53536	I	0	“ I know something happened after your dad passed … but I do n’t know what it was , and I feel horrible asking . ”
53541	53572	53536	53536	I	0	“ Do n’t . We were n’t exactly open about it . It was a fucked up time . It was n’t the way Mom wanted people to see us . ”
53573	53579	53536	53536	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
53580	53589	53590	53590	I	0	“ Dad died after a fight with Julian , ”
53620	53653	53603	53603	I	0	“ Nobody knows about this . Most people think Julian went away because he was depressed . They definitely did n’t think it was because Mom blamed him for Dad ’s death . ”
53654	53670	53671	53671	Aly	43	“ I remember my mom mentioning that Julian took a job overseas at one point , ”
53686	53727	53679	53679	she	43	“ I remember her saying how smart he was . For getting a change of scenery to help get over things . She said she ’d always wanted to go to Sweden . That ’s where he went , right ? ”
53728	53742	53743	53743	I	0	“ Yeah . Everyone spins everything we do into something cool or glamorous , ”
53754	53790	53791	53791	Aly	43	“ But the truth was that for a good five years after Dad died , we were barely a family anymore . None of us were talking for awhile . Not to Julian at least . ”
53798	53811	53791	53791	Aly	43	“ Not even you ? But you guys were always so close . ”
53812	53875	53876	53876	I	0	“ Well , he was far away . And while he was gone , he made some decisions that made us feel like he was going to stay away for good . And Mom was n’t doing well . Gram was n’t either . They ’d both lost their husbands in one week , so they were my priority . Not Julian , ”
53899	53907	53892	53892	I	0	“ So it was all on you ? ”
53922	53933	53934	53934	I	0	“ You were eighteen years old and everyone ’s rock ? ”
53965	53985	53958	53958	I	0	“ That ’s why I ’m excited to start building on the family again . We all needed this , ”
54001	54010	54011	54011	she	43	“ You ’re going to be an uncle , ”
54026	54040	54011	54011	she	43	“ Fun Uncle Emmett . That ’s got a nice ring to it . ”
54041	54044	54045	54045	I	0	“ Definitely , ”
54378	54382	54383	54383	I	0	“ Holy shit , ”
54437	54485	54423	54423	Emmett	1603	“ We can stay here tonight if you want . Julian ’s already back in the Hamptons , so I ’ll have him take Ozzy for the night . And then I ’ll get up early with you so we can head back to the Hamptons together . ”
54500	54507	54508	54508	I	0	“ In the helicopter . Yes . ”
54533	54560	54514	54514	God	223	“ I do n’t know . I obviously want to but I have to get to work early tomorrow to take care of this stupid thing . ”
54561	54566	54514	54514	God	223	“ What stupid thing ? ”
54567	54621	54622	54622	I	0	“ My liquor license . It ’s about to expire and the new application got delayed , so I need to take care of that before we have to shut down our booze program . The brunch people would pretty much lose their minds if they could n’t order their Bloody Mary ’s , ”
54633	54638	54639	54639	He	1603	“ Hey . Easy . ”
54666	54686	54687	54687	he	1603	“ I know people at the liquor authority . I can just make a call and push it through , ”
54701	54706	54692	54692	I	0	“ Are you serious ? ”
54707	54713	54714	54714	he	1603	“ Yeah . Sound good ? ”
54726	54739	54692	54692	I	0	“ Why even hesitate about this if it makes your life easier ? ”
54740	54770	54692	54692	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Because I ’m not used to getting things so easy . It makes me feel guilty . Like I did n’t earn it . ”
54771	54785	54786	54786	Emmett	1603	“ You ’ve busted your ass for everything in your life so far , ”
54793	54826	54827	54827	he	1603	“ So cash in on my luck for once . You know you deserve it . Especially if it means we get to spend the night here instead of heading back now , ”
54835	54857	54827	54827	he	1603	“ It ’s just so late already and I want us to be able to relax for a bit before bed . ”
54885	54887	54827	54827	he	1603	“ relax ”
54891	54893	54827	54827	he	1603	“ us ”
54911	54914	54915	54915	I	0	“ Okay , ”
54927	54941	54915	54915	I	0	“ Let ’s do it then . Let ’s just stay here tonight . ”
55067	55079	55057	55057	Emmett	1603	“ Do n’t look in there . It ’s a mess . ”
55080	55092	55093	55093	I	0	“ Really ? That ’s a mess to you these days ? ”
55162	55172	55173	55173	I	0	“ I do n’t know how to talk anymore , ”
55181	55198	55199	55199	Emmett	1603	“ You were expressing surprise for the fact that I ’m not a teenaged slob anymore , ”
55210	55262	55199	55199	Emmett	1603	“ Oh yeah ! Oh God , you used to shed your shoes and socks while going up the stairs and leave like , a trail of your clothes down the hall . I also remember never being able to see more than a few inches of floor in your room . ”
55263	55281	55282	55282	Emmett	1603	“ Well , we ’ve established that I ’ve changed a pretty good amount since high school , ”
55285	55315	55282	55282	Emmett	1603	“ Plus , living in the same building as Julian means him dropping by unannounced all the time , which means I got ta keep this place looking good . ”
55316	55335	55336	55336	I	0	“ Oh , and you ’re going to have to start baby - proofing a couple rooms too , ”
55383	55396	55397	55397	he	1603	“ Yeah . Man . We definitely got a lot to do , ”
55411	55423	55424	55424	he	1603	“ I wonder if it ’s a boy or a girl , ”
55432	55439	55424	55424	he	1603	“ Do you have a preference ? ”
55512	55520	55521	55521	he	1603	“ I know Julian wants a girl , ”
55524	55554	55521	55521	he	1603	“ So I ’m gon na root for a girl , too . But either way , it ’s going to be awesome to have a baby Hoult around . ”
55555	55573	55574	55574	I	0	“ Mm - hm . Fun uncle ’s gon na be a pretty natural role for you , ”
55577	55580	55581	55581	he	1603	“ Definitely , ”
55608	55625	55626	55626	he	1603	“ Though it kind of sucks that my kids wo n’t have their own fun uncle , ”
55640	55647	55648	55648	he	1603	“ Because Julian ’s so serious , ”
55655	55676	55677	55677	I	0	“ No , yeah , I got that . I think I was just … surprised that you wanted kids , ”
55691	55699	55700	55700	Emmett	1603	“ Because you ’re so against relationships ? ”
55706	55711	55712	55712	he	1603	“ I ’m not , ”
55722	55740	55712	55712	he	1603	“ But you wo n’t let yourself have one . Not after that one girlfriend in college , ”
55808	55825	55826	55826	he	1603	“ I did n’t let myself commit to anyone because I did n’t think I could , ”
55834	55867	55826	55826	he	1603	“ Even if I wanted to , I had … reasons for why I ’d have to up and leave out of nowhere . And that would n’t be fair to her . ”
55908	55950	55951	55951	he	1603	“ I made that whole ten - day rule so I would n’t be tempted to get attached to anyone . I know it happens when you ’ve been with someone long enough , and I did n’t want to risk , ”
55966	55974	55975	55975	he	1603	“ What ’s that face , Aly ? ”
55982	56001	55979	55979	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I guess I do n’t like hearing about your no relationships rule . ”
56002	56024	56025	56025	he	1603	“ Fair . But like I said before , you ’ve always been the exception to any one of my rules , ”
56035	56051	56052	56052	Emmett	1603	“ I do n’t have a choice when it comes to being attached to you , ”
56056	56091	56092	56092	I	0	“ I am and I ’ve been . For as long as I can remember . You ’re just a way of life for me that I do n’t want to give up again . ”
56097	56104	56105	56105	I	0	“ What exactly are you saying ? ”
56160	56193	56194	56194	he	1603	“ I ’m saying that I ’ve been waiting twelve years for you , and I do n’t want anyone else . I want to be with you , and only you , ”
56238	56243	56244	56244	he	1603	“ So you in ? ”
56278	56281	56282	56282	I	0	“ Obviously , ”
56295	56300	56286	56286	he	1603	“ I ’m in . ”
56347	56349	56345	56345	I	0	“ destroyed ”
56579	56589	56590	56590	he	298	“ Hey . I come in peace , alright ? ”
56602	56614	56615	56615	I	0	“ You ’re a fuckin ’ asshole , you know that ? ”
56626	56636	56637	56637	he	298	“ Whoa , hey , what ’s going on ? ”
56654	56668	56669	56669	Drew	298	“ Nothing . Emmett ’s just pissed that I ’m an exceptional wingman , ”
56680	56689	56690	56690	I	0	“ Yeah ? Is that what that was ? ”
56709	56724	56725	56725	Iain	79	“ Somehow I ’m lost on how you kissing Aly is winging for me . ”
56735	56748	56725	56725	Iain	79	“ You kissed his girl ? The fuck is wrong with you ? ”
56755	56793	56794	56794	I	0	“ What ? It was n’t real . There was no tongue . I was just doing it to piss off Emmett to piss off Beth . Because Beth pissed off Ellie . Does that make sense ? ”
56806	56817	56818	56818	I	0	“ He did n’t get any of the names right , ”
56821	56824	56818	56818	I	0	“ Ah . ”
56825	56828	56829	56829	Drew	298	“ Whatever , ”
56846	56857	56858	56858	he	298	“ I maintain that I did a good thing there , ”
56863	56922	56858	56858	he	298	“ If it were n’t for me , you would ’ve wasted your time on that platonic shit for who knows how long . And at some point , someone would ’ve snatched her up , and you would ’ve turned into a mopey little shit because you ’ve pretty much wanted this girl since your balls dropped . ”
56923	56930	56931	56931	Drew	298	“ What are you talking about ? ”
56934	57001	56931	56931	Drew	298	“ Dude . Whether you realize it or not , you talked about this girl fucking constantly . Even before she came back into the picture . You never mentioned her by name but half your stories from childhood involved ‘ that friend I grew up with , ’ and you always referred to that friend as a she so I put two and two together . ”
57002	57005	57006	57006	Iain	79	“ Wow , ”
57018	57023	57024	57024	Drew	298	“ That ’s right , ”
57030	57099	57100	57100	I	0	“ I know you think you ’re slick , Hoult , but you ’re not . I mean I ’m not the most detail - oriented guy , so if I noticed that you ’re in love with this girl then you ’re in love with her . And you should n’t have even wasted your time on the friends shit . End of story . Mic drop . ”
57105	57115	57100	57100	I	0	“ It was good until the last few words . ”
57116	57149	57150	57150	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’m gon na take that as a thank you , and to that I say fuck you . Now I ’m the only bachelor left in the group . ”
57166	57184	57100	57100	I	0	“ Yeah , well maybe if you stop chasing girls with a history of trespassing and stalking , ”
57197	57211	57212	57212	Drew	298	“ Hey , a lot of the crazy ones happen to be beautiful , ”
57223	57247	57248	57248	Iain	79	“ Yeah , well Emmett just scored him a beautiful , sane woman so stop making excuses and get out of my office , ”
57258	57272	57248	57248	Iain	79	“ I have a meeting and you have physical therapy in an hour . ”
57273	57278	57279	57279	Drew	298	“ Jesus . Fine , ”
57285	57297	57279	57279	Drew	298	“ What are you doing , E ? Wanna get food ? ”
57298	57305	57306	57306	I	0	“ I ’m Iain ’s meeting , ”
57322	57368	57369	57369	I	0	“ But I owe you dinner for your non - traditional winging , alright ? It ’s going to take me a second to believe that you pulled that shit for noble purposes , but if you did , you did a damned good job , ”
57372	57394	57395	57395	Drew	298	“ Yeah , yeah . Probably gon na be my last night out with you before you get all wifed up , ”
57426	57433	57434	57434	I	0	“ Nice client you ’ve got , ”
57437	57455	57456	57456	Iain	79	“ Hey , I ’m only associated to that prick through work . What ’s your excuse ? ”
57491	57500	57480	57480	he	79	“ So you bringing Aly to the gala ? ”
57501	57511	57480	57480	he	79	“ Hopefully . I have n’t asked her yet . ”
57512	57516	57480	57480	he	79	“ Why not ? ”
57517	57533	57480	57480	he	79	“ Have n’t really had the time . It ’s kind of been a whirlwind . ”
57534	57543	57544	57544	I	0	“ Well , how serious are you two ? ”
57552	57559	57544	57544	I	0	“ Why are you grilling me ? ”
57560	57565	57566	57566	he	79	“ You know why , ”
57575	57589	57566	57566	he	79	“ I ’m curious about whether or not you ’ve told her about – ”
57590	57593	57594	57594	I	0	“ No , ”
57600	57614	57594	57594	I	0	“ I have n’t . And I do n’t plan on it either . ”
57615	57618	57619	57619	He	79	“ Whoa . ”
57625	57655	57656	57656	he	79	“ That ’s fine , Emmett . I ’m just wondering so I know what I ’m allowed to say around her when I see her at the gala , ”
57671	57679	57680	57680	he	79	“ What are you so tense about ? ”
57683	57713	57714	57714	I	0	“ You really do n’t have anything to feel guilty about . What you did was ages ago . Well before you thought you ’d ever see Aly again . ”
57787	57797	57798	57798	Iain	79	“ Trust me , Emmett . You ’re good , ”
57806	57864	57801	57801	He	79	“ I mean if all the things Drew said before were true , then this is the one and only girl you ’ve really cared about your whole life . So if she ever finds out about all the shit , I ’m sure she ’ll be able to look past it . Trust me on that ? ”
57865	57868	57869	57869	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
57880	57884	57869	57869	I	0	“ Sure thing . ”
58138	58145	58115	58115	I	0	“ Go , go , go . ”
58518	58521	58522	58522	Aly	223	“ Emmett ? ”
58535	58542	58543	58543	I	0	“ Shit . I ’m sorry , ”
58626	58635	58636	58636	she	223	“ Mm . Sounds like a long day , ”
58664	58681	58682	58682	I	0	“ It was pretty long . But it felt longer because I was away from you , ”
58735	58747	58748	58748	I	0	“ Listen , I ’ve been meaning to ask you something , ”
58779	58784	58785	58785	Aly	223	“ What ’s up ? ”
58795	58811	58812	58812	I	0	“ I was wondering if you ’d be my date for the gala next week , ”
58822	58834	58812	58812	I	0	“ Why do you seem surprised to hear me ask that ? ”
58835	58857	58858	58858	she	223	“ I do n’t know . Because I ’m sleepy and I have trouble hiding my reactions when I ’m sleepy , ”
58862	58911	58858	58858	she	223	“ And I guess because it ’s just … such a big , important thing for you . Full of fancy people . I just thought you might not want to bring me as a date . ‘ Cause then you ’ll have to introduce me to everyone . ”
58912	58917	58918	58918	Aly	223	“ Yeah . Exactly . ”
58921	58930	58931	58931	she	223	“ You want to introduce me to everyone ? ”
58934	58941	58931	58931	she	223	“ As your … you know ? ”
58942	58945	58946	58946	I	0	“ Girlfriend ? ”
58962	58970	58931	58931	she	223	“ Yeah , Aly . I do . ”
58971	58979	58931	58931	she	223	“ So I can call you my … ”
58980	58988	58989	58989	I	0	“ Boyfriend ? Jesus Christ . Yes , ”
59062	59067	59053	59053	I	0	“ Aly . What ? ”
59068	59077	59078	59078	she	223	“ I do n’t have anything to wear , ”
59081	59084	59053	59053	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
59085	59106	59107	59107	I	0	“ To your gala . If it ’s black tie , I definitely do n’t have anything appropriate to wear . ”
59117	59131	59132	59132	I	0	“ So ? Then I ’ll just have to take you shopping tomorrow , ”
59145	59155	59132	59132	I	0	“ No . Do n’t do that , Emmett … ”
59156	59160	59114	59114	her	223	“ Why not ? ”
59161	59177	59178	59178	she	223	“ I do n’t have the money to pay you back for a nice dress , ”
59186	59198	59181	59181	I	0	“ Have you never had a boyfriend buy you gifts before ? ”
59199	59208	59209	59209	she	223	“ I … have . But small things , ”
59216	59225	59209	59209	she	223	“ Not big things . Or expensive things . ”
59226	59259	59260	59260	I	0	“ Yeah , well , we ’ve already established that your exes were idiots , so let ’s make this the last time you compare me to them ever again , alright ? ”
59269	59272	59273	59273	she	223	“ Fine , ”
59290	59297	59298	59298	she	223	“ It ’s no contest anyway , ”
59522	59546	59547	59547	Evie	43	“ Poor Teddy . I do n’t think he even knew how much this estrogen - fest of a restaurant was affecting him , ”
59562	59574	59550	59550	she	43	“ Yeah , he just needed a boy to talk to , ”
59589	59617	59578	59578	Hannah	90	“ Yeah , that ’s not a boy though . That ’s a man . That ’s like , the Merriam - Webster definition of a man . ”
59618	59639	59640	59640	Evie	43	“ Really ? So if I look in the dictionary , there ’ll be a picture of Aly ’s boyfriend ? ”
59655	59658	59644	59644	I	0	“ boyfriend . ”
59744	59756	59757	59757	Evie	43	“ Hey . So I have good news and bad news , ”
59771	59780	59781	59781	I	0	“ Hit me with the bad news first , ”
59784	59788	59789	59789	Evie	43	“ Got it , ”
59816	59819	59820	59820	I	0	“ Evie , ”
59823	59843	59844	59844	Evie	43	“ I already know that they canceled their reservation for Sunday . Hannah told me when I came in . ”
59847	59850	59851	59851	She	43	“ Oh . ”
59856	59863	59851	59851	She	43	“ And you ’re not upset ? ”
59915	59964	59965	59965	I	0	“ I honestly knew this was going to happen the day my mom called and said ‘ book that day , we ’re coming . ’ She wants to make it happen , but he does n’t , and in the end she ’ll always yield to him , ”
59974	59994	59965	59965	I	0	“ But do n’t be upset . I ’m … slightly more at peace about this whole thing now . ”
59995	60000	59969	59969	Evie	43	“ Because of Emmett ? ”
60001	60004	60005	60005	I	0	“ Maybe , ”
60008	60047	60048	60048	I	0	“ I just feel a little clearer in my head , if that makes sense . And I feel happy now in a way I do n’t think I ’ve … ever been ? In my whole life ? ”
60057	60105	60048	60048	I	0	“ And it makes me kind of anxious because I feel like there ’s got ta be a catch . But it feels way too good for me to stop , so I guess I ’m just gon na ride the high till the other shoe drops . ”
60138	60155	60156	60156	she	43	“ Woman . There is no need to be that negative . Sometimes good things last , ”
60167	60220	60160	60160	she	43	“ I know I ’m not the best person to sell that point because me and Mike are … whatever we are … but if I can tell you one thing for sure , it ’s that I ’ve never seen you smile as hard as you ’ve smiled all day today . ”
60227	60240	60241	60241	I	0	“ He ’s definitely helping me relax and enjoy myself for once , ”
60245	60257	60241	60241	I	0	“ Which is … still kind of weird to think about . ”
60358	60367	60368	60368	Evie	43	“ Well , you know what I say ? ”
60391	60398	60399	60399	she	43	“ I say you deserve it , ”
60409	60414	60399	60399	she	43	“ And so do I. ”
60415	60421	60422	60422	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
60425	60441	60442	60442	she	43	“ I mean the application for or new liquor license got magically pushed through today , ”
60453	60498	60442	60442	she	43	“ And since I ’m pretty sure it was your eight - pack - havin’ boyfriend who helped us out with that , I ’m gon na tell you now to fuck him extra good tonight . As a thank you from us both . ”
60499	60507	60508	60508	I	0	“ Oh . My God , Evie , ”
60518	60532	60533	60533	she	43	“ Sorry . For that , I ’ll finish closing on my own , ”
60549	60566	60533	60533	she	43	“ Now go shop with your man . He ’s been waiting long enough for you . ”
60726	60734	60735	60735	Emmett	1603	“ None for me , thank you , ”
60746	60760	60735	60735	Emmett	1603	“ But I ’m sure my girlfriend would n’t mind taking my share . ”
60822	60825	60826	60826	Rose	133	“ So , ”
60836	60852	60826	60826	Rose	133	“ I take it you ’re the lucky one who stole him away from us ? ”
60860	60865	60826	60826	Rose	133	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
60866	60906	60907	60907	she	133	“ Oh , the shop girls and I – we go to Blue Harbor for drinks after our shifts . We usually see Emmett there with his friends most nights , but not so much the past few weeks , ”
60927	60939	60940	60940	she	133	“ Is it because he ’s been staying home with you ? ”
60947	60950	60951	60951	My	0	“ Oh . ”
60955	60960	60961	60961	I	0	“ Actually … maybe , ”
61007	61019	61020	61020	She	133	“ Well then whatever you ’re doing , keep doing it . ”
61035	61061	61020	61020	She	133	“ Because that man ’s definitely never liked a girl enough to stay home for her – or go shopping with her for that matter . ”
61067	61074	61062	61062	I	0	“ And you know this because ? ”
61075	61095	61096	61096	Rose	133	“ Because tracking that man ’s relationship status is just a thing we do in this town every summer , ”
61109	61117	61102	61102	she	133	“ At least it was until now . ”
61118	61124	61125	61125	I	0	“ Huh . I see , ”
61252	61262	61263	61263	he	1603	“ Baby . Did you find anything you like ? ”
61272	61274	61269	61269	him	1603	“ baby ”
61325	61328	61319	61319	I	0	“ Whoa . ”
61355	61359	61360	61360	Emmett	0	“ That ’s ... ”
61389	61397	61398	61398	he	0	“ Yeah . That ’s the one , ”
61413	61416	61398	61398	he	0	“ Right ? ”
61425	61447	61448	61448	I	0	“ I think so . I just need to make sure it fits . Will you zip the back for me ? ”
61485	61496	61497	61497	he	0	“ It ’s actually painful how fucking beautiful you are , ”
61525	61541	61542	61542	I	0	“ Why does it look like zipping me up takes every ounce of your strength ? ”
61545	61562	61542	61542	I	0	“ Because that ’s exactly what it does when all I ever want is you naked . ”
61661	61666	61648	61648	he	0	“ I love it , ”
61761	61764	61765	61765	I	0	“ Sure , ”
61968	61971	61972	61972	I	0	“ Emmett … ”
62074	62077	62078	62078	he	0	“ Christ , ”
62088	62095	62096	62096	he	0	“ Is this becoming a habit ? ”
62115	62121	62122	62122	I	0	“ I took them off , ”
62137	62145	62122	62122	I	0	“ I did n’t want panty lines . ”
62146	62151	62152	62152	He	0	“ Mm - hm . ”
62200	62212	62213	62213	Emmett	0	“ You ’re so wet you ’re dripping down your thighs , ”
62222	62235	62218	62218	he	0	“ Well , what do you want me to do about it ? ”
62250	62276	62277	62277	he	0	“ I want to watch you sink that pussy down to the base of my cock . That ’s what I want you to do , ”
62307	62332	62337	62337	he	0	“ But since I do n’t have a condom , I ’ll settle for watching you while I make you come in this dress . ”
62379	62384	62385	62385	he	0	“ You ’re soaked , ”
62429	62442	62443	62443	he	0	“ Fuck , baby , do n’t clench so tight around me , ”
62455	62465	62443	62443	he	0	“ You ’re making my dick so fucking hard . ”
62466	62472	62473	62473	I	0	“ Let me feel it , ”
62539	62545	62546	62546	I	0	“ I want it inside , ”
62554	62564	62546	62546	I	0	“ Do n’t say that to me right now . ”
62565	62570	62571	62571	I	0	“ I mean it , ”
62581	62598	62571	62571	I	0	“ I ’m on the pill , and I ’m clean , so if you are … ”
62677	62680	62681	62681	Emmett	0	“ Aly , ”
62692	62696	62681	62681	Emmett	0	“ Holy fuck . ”
62787	62796	62797	62797	Emmett	0	“ Yes , baby . Ride my cock , ”
62815	62820	62821	62821	he	0	“ That ’s right , ”
62862	62876	62877	62877	he	0	“ You ’re getting my dick so wet with your juices , baby , ”
63038	63044	63045	63045	Emmett	0	“ Do it , baby , ”
63048	63060	63045	63045	Emmett	0	“ Come all over my cock . Let me feel it . ”
63350	63352	63333	63333	I	0	“ real ”
63549	63553	63535	63535	Emmett	1603	“ stay with me ”
63555	63560	63535	63535	Emmett	1603	“ five more minutes , ”
63661	63673	63676	63676	Evie	43	“ That ’s a good problem , ya ding - dong . ”
63734	63737	63738	63738	I	0	“ Morning , ”
64148	64152	64140	64140	I	0	“ Good morning ? ”
64206	64210	64211	64211	he	1603	“ ’ Morning , ”
64257	64260	64245	64245	he	1603	“ Hey . ”
64261	64265	64266	64266	I	0	“ Hey yourself , ”
64286	64297	64280	64280	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re up this early . ”
64298	64310	64311	64311	he	1603	“ I wanted you to have a nice breakfast before work , ”
64326	64354	64358	64358	him	1603	“ I cleaned up the stuff on the dining room table and put it in your folder , which should save you a couple minutes , right ? ”
64363	64368	64369	64369	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
64474	64487	64469	64469	I	0	“ Emmett … for lack of better words , what the fuck ? ”
64517	64550	64509	64509	he	1603	“ I feel like I ’m at some super fancy restaurant . Do you realize how much money a restaurant could make if you were the chef and you served everyone shirtless ? ”
64551	64571	64493	64493	I	0	“ That ’s definitely an idea . But I only bust out these moves for a select few people . ”
64572	64599	64509	64509	he	1603	“ That ’s smart , because if you did this for any of your hook - ups , they ’d fall instantly in love with you . ”
64600	64612	64613	64613	Emmett	1603	“ Is that what you ’re doing with me right now ? ”
64647	64663	64642	64642	he	1603	“ You need cream for you coffee , right ? Half - and - half ? ”
64664	64672	64642	64642	he	1603	“ Yes . I can get it – ”
64673	64694	64695	64695	I	0	“ No , I ’ll get it . Start eating . You only have a little more than ten minutes . ”
64736	64754	64755	64755	I	0	“ Emmett . This is delicious . This is better than stuff I ’ve had at restaurants , ”
64769	64781	64782	64782	I	0	“ When the hell did you learn to cook like this ? ”
64785	64806	64807	64807	He	1603	“ When we were in high school , you used to set off the fire alarm while using the microwave . ”
64810	64828	64807	64807	He	1603	“ Yeah . I think it was actually a talent how bad I was at cooking then . ”
64829	64837	64860	64860	he	1603	“ You messed up instant ramen once . ”
64838	64842	64807	64807	He	1603	“ Sure did . ”
64843	64850	64851	64851	I	0	“ So … explanations ? Please ? ”
64889	64911	64879	64879	I	0	“ When I was in college , my other roommate Lukas taught me the basics . Mostly how to cook eggs . ”
64912	64923	64924	64924	I	0	“ Where ’d you learn the rest of it then ? ”
64927	64950	64951	64951	Emmett	1603	“ How ’d you learn to prep and time and plate so perfectly ? Because I ’m kind of amazed right now . ”
64966	64972	64973	64973	he	1603	“ I do n’t know , ”
64977	65000	64973	64973	he	1603	“ I just had to learn . I needed to feed myself . The cafeteria food at college was n’t the best . ”
65008	65062	65063	65063	Emmett	1603	“ You used to eat plain cold cuts in high school because you were too lazy to get bread from the pantry . I also recall the fact that you were happy to eat multiple bowls of cereal for dinner , because ‘ cereal ’s already here and ordering out takes time . ’ ”
65073	65084	65085	65085	he	1603	“ That ’s … yep . That ’s completely accurate , ”
65096	65118	65119	65119	he	1603	“ Speaking of dinner though , one of my friends opened a restaurant in Montauk . Can I take you tonight ? ”
65158	65162	65163	65163	I	0	“ Of course , ”
65166	65179	65163	65163	I	0	“ Is it a super fancy place that requires me dressing nicely ? ”
65180	65201	65202	65202	Emmett	1603	“ No , but if you want some new dresses , I ’m more than happy to go shopping again , ”
65209	65231	65202	65202	Emmett	1603	“ You better not talk about that because we do n’t have the time to get all turned on right now . ”
65232	65237	65238	65238	Emmett	1603	“ Fuck . True , ”
65254	65263	65238	65238	Emmett	1603	“ You got two minutes to finish eating . ”
65264	65284	65285	65285	I	0	“ No way am I gon na finish all this , but I ’m already very full and content , ”
65299	65307	65285	65285	I	0	“ But you should definitely finish it . ”
65308	65317	65238	65238	Emmett	1603	“ I ’ll save the hash for later . ”
65318	65330	65331	65331	I	0	“ Why ? Going right back to bed once I leave ? ”
65334	65343	65344	65344	he	1603	“ You bet your sexy ass I am , ”
65439	65447	65448	65448	Aly	43	“ I have fish guts on me , ”
65490	65494	65481	65481	she	43	“ Got it . ”
65495	65528	65529	65529	she	43	“ Do n’t come near me ! I ’m gross and I need to pop in the shower real quick , but I wo n’t make us late for dinner – promise ! ”
65547	65555	65529	65529	she	43	“ Now you get five more minutes , ”
66113	66116	66117	66117	I	0	“ Hey ! ”
66268	66270	66238	66238	men	379	“ Congratulations ”
66385	66388	66389	66389	she	223	“ Hey ! ”
66409	66419	66389	66389	she	223	“ What ’s up ? What ’s going on ? ”
66428	66430	66420	66420	I	0	“ nothing ”
66440	66445	66420	66420	I	0	“ I love you . ”
66532	66540	66529	66529	she	223	“ I love you , Emmett Hoult . ”
66543	66556	66542	66542	ALY	223	“ I have something to ask you and something to tell you . ”
66730	66734	66724	66724	I	0	“ Hit me . ”
66735	66746	66747	66747	Emmett	1603	“ When was the last time you saw your dad ? ”
66759	66767	66768	66768	I	0	“ Um . Maybe December for Christmas ? ”
66786	66894	66895	66895	Emmett	1603	“ Wow . It ’s weird . It does n’t feel that long ago because I know he ’s so close by . And I still hear him in the background when my mom calls every week . I mean talk sometimes , too . Never for more than a minute or so , but it ’s just the relationship I have with him . And I ’ve obviously always wanted more , but it is what it is . I ’m too exhausted to try to talk to him about it now . Besides , it does n’t break my heart on a daily basis anymore . ”
66922	66943	66944	66944	he	1603	“ I was really happy when Mom told me you bought his company . I thought that would fix everything , ”
66948	66951	66944	66944	he	1603	“ Yeah , ”
66959	66989	66990	66990	I	0	“ Me too . Though I ’m starting to realize that I ’m still happy with all the choices I made . All the hard work I put in , ”
67003	67059	66990	66990	I	0	“ Even if it did n’t work to win his approval , it ’s still the first thing I did on my own . And I do n’t know why , but the more I work and the more established the restaurant gets , the less I feel the need to prove myself to him . ”
67060	67070	67071	67071	Emmett	1603	“ Because you ’ve already proved yourself to yourself , ”
67080	67123	67124	67124	he	1603	“ You ’re a fucking rock star . Not a lot of people can do what you did and sacrifice so much of their lives to achieving a goal . God knows I do n’t have that kind of hustle in me , ”
67127	67135	67136	67136	I	0	“ That ’s not true , Emmett , ”
67151	67177	67136	67136	I	0	“ Maybe you had a head start , but that does n’t mean you did n’t have to keep working to maintain everything you have . ”
67178	67192	67193	67193	Emmett	1603	“ That ’s definitely a good word to describe my life . Maintenance , ”
67217	67241	67242	67242	He	1603	“ Anyway , the other thing I meant to tell you is that your dad might show up to the gala on Saturday . ”
67245	67253	67254	67254	I	0	“ Will that be okay for you ? ”
67267	67270	67271	67271	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
67275	67298	67271	67271	I	0	“ That ’s fine , honestly . I ’d kind of stopped expecting things from Dad awhile ago . And I think , ”
67308	67366	67301	67301	Emmett	1603	“ that when you knocked some sense into me the morning after I moved out , I realized … as sad as it sounds … that I was holding onto something that was never there . There never really was hope to get him to love me – not the way I always wanted , at least . ”
67367	67370	67371	67371	Emmett	1603	“ Aly , ”
67379	67400	67371	67371	Emmett	1603	“ I ’m sorry for everything I said that day . I know it was harsh , and it was – ”
67401	67404	67405	67405	I	0	“ True , ”
67420	67469	67470	67470	I	0	“ Everything you said that day was true , Emmett , and the fact that I avoided you all those years kind of proves it . I knew you were the only one who knew me well enough to call me out and pull me out of delusion , ”
67473	67558	67559	67559	I	0	“ And as hard as it as to accept that I ’d lied to myself most of my life , it was also a huge weight off my back . Because now I do n’t actually want to try anymore . I ’m not living to impress my dad . Holding out hope for someone who does n’t even think about you on a daily basis is pretty much the most painful waste of time in the world , and I realize that now , ”
67577	67596	67574	67574	I	0	“ I realized it too late , but at least I did at all . Thanks to you . ”
67612	67621	67622	67622	he	0	“ You ’re impressive . You know that ? ”
67635	67642	67622	67622	he	0	“ Why are you saying this ? ”
67643	67660	67661	67661	Emmett	1603	“ Because you ’re strong and smart , and you ’ve done everything on your own , ”
67665	67748	67749	67749	Emmett	1603	“ You ’ve been knocked down however many times , and you ’ve never stayed on the ground . I do n’t know what that ’s like . My dad used to say , ‘ When it comes to the race of life , you two were dropped off way ahead of the others . You should always know and remember that . ’ And I did , but it never hit me quite as hard as it ’s hitting me now , ”
67757	67770	67752	67752	he	0	“ And it just makes me that much more amazed by you . ”
67821	67832	67808	67808	Emmett	1603	“ Well , before you get too proud of me , ”
67837	67853	67833	67833	I	0	“ I feel like I should admit that I have a petty side to me . ”
67857	67860	67833	67833	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
67861	67919	67808	67808	Emmett	1603	“ Oh yeah . As much as I ’m getting over my whole thing with Dad , I still want to hear him admit that I did good – and not just good , but better than him . I know that ’s kind of evil , and that I should n’t care , but I do . ”
67920	67925	67926	67926	Emmett	1603	“ That ’s fine , ”
67930	67939	67926	67926	Emmett	1603	“ You deserve recognition for what you did . ”
67940	67948	67949	67949	I	0	“ I do n’t need it though , ”
67952	67970	67971	67971	I	0	“ At this point , I ’m pretty sure I have everything I need to be happy , ”
67986	67995	67996	67996	he	1603	“ I ’m pretty sure I do too , ”
68003	68012	68013	68013	he	1603	“ Actually , I know that I do , ”
68017	68041	68042	68042	he	1603	“ And I know that if you ever so much as think you ’re missing something , I ’ll find it for you , ”
68056	68069	68042	68042	he	1603	“ Because I ’ve honestly only ever wanted you to be happy . ”
68178	68182	68183	68183	I	0	“ Good Lord , ”
68198	68201	68183	68183	I	0	“ What ? ”
68202	68222	68183	68183	I	0	“ Nothing . I ’m just still amazed by the perks that come with being Emmett Hoult ’s girlfriend . ”
68223	68229	68230	68230	he	1603	“ Well , stick around , ”
68233	68241	68242	68242	I	0	“ You ai n’t seen nothing yet . ”
68379	68398	68360	68360	he	1603	“ Aly , Julian ’s called twice for some reason . Do you mind if I take it ? ”
68408	68413	68399	68399	Emmett	1603	“ Go for it , ”
68508	68520	68521	68521	My	0	“ Omigod – Aly Stanton ? Bitch , get over here ! ”
68562	68565	68555	68555	I	0	“ Drea ! ”
68586	68596	68555	68555	I	0	“ I have n’t seen you in so long ! ”
68597	68603	68604	68604	Drea	1361	“ Three years I think ! ”
68630	68644	68645	68645	she	936	“ Oops – careful . They ’re expensive and I like my earlobes ! ”
68666	68690	68645	68645	she	936	“ Holy shit , lady . I do n’t even know how I recognized you with the long hair ! You look amazing ! ”
68691	68710	68711	68711	I	0	“ And you . I did n’t think you could get more glamorous but you proved me wrong ! ”
68767	68776	68749	68749	She	936	“ So what are you doing in Montauk ? ”
68777	68814	68815	68815	she	936	“ Oh , I ’m just here to visit some college friends , but I was thinking of you because I ’ve been reading such amazing things about your restaurant , and I am so proud ! ”
68830	68861	68815	68815	she	936	“ Psh , well , I could n’t have done it without you ! You showed me the ropes on how to do pretty much everything that I needed to – ”
68862	68865	68866	68866	Drea	1361	“ Oh ! ”
68894	68897	68898	68898	I	0	“ Oh . ”
68903	68908	68898	68898	I	0	“ That ’s just – ”
68909	68912	68913	68913	Drea	1361	“ Emmett ? ”
68933	68938	68930	68930	He	1603	“ Shit . Drea . ”
69009	69019	69020	69020	she	1361	“ I did n’t expect to see you here , ”
69023	69033	69034	69034	Emmett	1603	“ Me neither . What are you doing here ? ”
69047	69054	69055	69055	Drea	1361	“ I … was just eating ? ”
69206	69219	69196	69196	Emmett	1603	“ It was so , so good to see you , Aly , ”
69933	69949	69950	69950	he	1603	“ I know you ’re at work . I just wanted to hear your voice , ”
70061	70104	70105	70105	he	1603	“ I ’m sorry , baby . The dinner with the gala speakers went long , and I was already on the Upper East Side , so I figured I ’d just see Mom and Gram and sleep here for the night , ”
70128	70141	70105	70105	he	1603	“ Do you want me to call Julian to pick up Ozzy ? ”
70142	70147	70148	70148	I	0	“ No , silly , ”
70151	70176	70148	70148	I	0	“ I can take care of Ozzy . I ’ll wake up a little earlier in the morning so I can take him out . ”
70177	70192	70105	70105	he	1603	“ Baby , no . You need every minute of sleep you can get . ”
70193	70223	70224	70224	He	1603	“ Trust me – fifteen minutes wo n’t make a difference . And it ’ll be easier for me to get out of bed when you ’re not there . ”
70230	70242	70243	70243	I	0	“ I did n’t say that to make you feel bad , ”
70247	70269	70270	70270	he	1603	“ I know . But it made me remember that I ’m going to be waking up alone in the morning , ”
70273	70284	70270	70270	he	1603	“ And I ’ve kind of gotten spoiled with you . ”
70285	70296	70297	70297	I	0	“ Trust me . I ’m in the same boat , ”
70307	70313	70297	70297	I	0	“ But it ’s okay . ”
70314	70325	70326	70326	I	0	“ Alright . Well , I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
70337	70343	70344	70344	I	0	“ You have to go ? ”
70350	70364	70347	70347	He	1603	“ Yeah . I think I ’m going to go to bed soon . ”
70379	70383	70384	70384	I	0	“ So early , ”
70387	70396	70384	70384	I	0	“ But you ’ve had a long day . ”
70397	70410	70411	70411	he	1603	“ Yeah . I ’ll text you in the morning , okay ? ”
70414	70417	70418	70418	I	0	“ Okay . ”
70457	70464	70465	70465	he	1603	“ I love you , baby , ”
70514	70521	70505	70505	I	0	“ I love you , too . ”
71150	71172	71173	71173	Evie	43	“ Poor Mike . He ’s going to be so sad when he realizes I stole the Milk & Cookies flavor , ”
71178	71203	71204	71204	She	43	“ But this is what he gets for eating my leftovers just because he forgot to buy himself frozen pizza . Oh my God . ”
71213	71243	71244	71244	I	0	“ Am I boring the shit out of you ? Because I think I just bored the shit out of me . Like , I actually felt it happen . ”
71247	71290	71244	71244	I	0	“ No , I ’d much rather listen to you than all the stupid , paranoid thoughts I ’m having , because they ’re telling me not to go to the gala tomorrow , and I already know that ’ll crush Emmett . ”
71291	71296	71297	71297	Evie	43	“ Damn . Really ? ”
71325	71335	71316	71316	his	440	“ Tomorrow means a lot to him , Aly … ”
71336	71370	71244	71244	I	0	“ I know . Which is why I do n’t want to let this paranoia push me into making a stupid decision . I ’m trying to talk myself through it right now . ”
71371	71380	71381	71381	she	43	“ Well , talk to me , girl , ”
71384	71433	71434	71434	I	0	“ ’Cause I ’ve been watching you randomly shudder and cringe to yourself all day and I know it ’s because you ’re bottling up whatever conspiracy theories you ’re cookin ’ up in that pretty head . So just spill . You know I do n’t judge . ”
71455	71466	71467	71467	Evie	43	“ Oh my God , this bed is so comfortable , ”
71496	71523	71467	71467	Evie	43	“ Okay . I ’m here . I ’m ready for discussion , and I know this is about Drea , so just get it out . ”
71524	71527	71528	71528	I	0	“ Fine , ”
71536	71587	71528	71528	I	0	“ I just … ca n’t help but feel weird about the fact that Emmett and I ran into her at dinner , there was clearly something weird between them , he would n’t talk to me about it , and then he went MIA for the next two days . ”
71588	71597	71598	71598	Evie	43	“ You think he ’s at her place ? ”
71601	71611	71598	71598	Evie	43	“ No . Maybe . I do n’t know . ”
71616	71680	71681	71681	Evie	43	“ In my heart , I do n’t believe it . But she does live in the city . They do have a history . And he did just see her . And if she ’s his one and only ex who inspired him to make his no - commitment rule , then there ’s clearly a lot of unfinished business between them . ”
71694	71702	71703	71703	she	43	“ Are you ready for my theory ? ”
71731	71824	71825	71825	Evie	43	“ I think that Emmett did not date Drea . But if they met and knew each other in college , that means it was during , you know , the darker times in his life . Maybe he was you know , King Frat Boy throwing some awesome party that she attended , and she walked in on him crying at some point ? Like , she saw him while he was weak and down , and he does n’t like that someone out there has seen that side of him ? ”
71838	71847	71825	71825	Evie	43	“ Nope . That sucks . Ignore it . ”
71848	71887	71888	71888	I	0	“ No , I ca n’t ignore it now , because that actually sounds like the reason why they would get together in the first place . Because his dad just died and he needed someone and aghhhh , ”
71907	71911	71912	71912	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
71920	71933	71934	71934	she	43	“ Okay , no more theories , but how ‘ bout this ? ”
71938	72032	71934	71934	she	43	“ Even if Emmett and Drea did date , he could very well be in the city for gala - only reasons , right ? You remember what it was like when we were first opening the restaurant and meeting with a million people every day – by just five o’clock we were pooped . And you said you heard his mom ’s voice in the background of your call yesterday , so he definitely did spend at least last night at her house , which counts for something . Does n’t it ? ”
72033	72036	72037	72037	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
72045	72062	72037	72037	I	0	“ And I do n’t know why , but I just … have faith in him . ”
72077	72087	72088	72088	I	0	“ I know we have n’t been dating long , ”
72092	72260	72261	72261	I	0	“ and I know I have n’t even known the adult version of Emmett Hoult for that long , but I believe everything he ’s told me about loving me . About me being his exception . He ’s just been so … quietly good to me for so many years . He let me ignore and blame him for more than a decade , and if he really wanted to , he could ’ve gone through my parents to track me down and clear his conscience by calling me out . But he just swallowed it and let me live my lie because he knew it made me feel better . But he still took me in when I needed a place to stay . He said yes to the whole platonic thing . He ’s been there for me through this whole psychological emancipation from my dad , and he ’s basically been the most incredible friend and boyfriend since we ’ve been living together , ”
72274	72308	72269	72269	I	0	“ And I ’m just so sold on his love that I ca n’t see the past two days as red flags . I just want to choose to have faith in him . ”
72326	72337	72317	72317	she	43	“ Fuck , that just made me want to cry . ”
72345	72350	72351	72351	I	0	“ You are crying , ”
72355	72362	72363	72363	she	43	“ I thought so . Balls , ”
72376	72379	72363	72363	she	43	“ Evie . ”
72402	72408	72410	72410	she	43	“ Oh no , bub . ”
72456	72464	72469	72469	her	43	“ Everything ’s going to be okay , ”
72485	72499	72500	72500	I	0	“ I know there are points where it does n’t seem like it , ”
72511	72523	72500	72500	I	0	“ But I promise everything ’s going to turn out fine . ”
72767	72771	72764	72764	I	0	“ I ’m fine ”
72775	72780	72764	72764	I	0	“ I ’m fine . ”
72813	72818	72820	72820	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
73018	73022	73023	73023	I	0	“ Everything okay ? ”
73029	73047	73048	73048	she	43	“ Yes . I think so . But … are you available to talk for a minute ? ”
73113	73120	73121	73121	I	0	“ Okay . I ’m here , ”
73124	73129	73121	73121	I	0	“ Talk to me . ”
73338	73362	73363	73363	Drew	298	“ E. You got ta stop doing that . I ca n’t be the only one getting anxious just from looking at you . ”
73386	73407	73372	73372	he	298	“ Just take it easy for a second , alright ? She ’s probably just doing her hair or something . ”
73408	73430	73431	73431	Drew	298	“ She knows this thing started an hour ago . And she does n’t take that long to do her hair . ”
73442	73459	73460	73460	he	298	“ Lipstick ? Shit , I do n’t know . Boss . Help me out here , ”
73473	73481	73482	73482	he	298	“ You looked like you needed it , ”
73493	73501	73482	73482	he	298	“ What ’s going on with him ? ”
73502	73512	73471	73471	Scotch	151	“ He ’s worried the girl ’s not coming . ”
73513	73516	73517	73517	Julian	39	“ Aly ? ”
73521	73563	73517	73517	Julian	39	“ If she ’s here as your date , you should keep in mind that Mom is also here and if she catches onto what ’s happening , she ’s going to spend the night scheduling when you two start trying . ”
73564	73574	73575	73575	Drew	298	“ You told her about your wife being pregnant ? ”
73578	73582	73575	73575	Drew	298	“ I did . ”
73583	73587	73588	73588	Drew	298	“ She happy ? ”
73591	73598	73599	73599	Julian	39	“ She ’s over the moon , ”
73632	73643	73644	73644	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s the least of my worries , ”
73649	73672	73644	73644	I	0	“ Mom ’s free to find out that I ’m with Aly . Just as long as I ’m still with Aly . ”
73673	73680	73644	73644	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
73681	73708	73709	73709	Drew	298	“ He thinks she ’s not coming tonight , even though she ’s probably just late . I mean what – you had a little fight ? ”
73712	73731	73732	73732	I	0	“ No . I mean maybe . I was just … away from the house for a bit , ”
73772	73793	73794	73794	Julian	39	“ Well , whatever that means , you need to breathe , Emmett . You have speeches to make tonight , ”
73798	73807	73808	73808	Drew	298	“ And you look like a fucking mess , ”
73816	73825	73811	73811	I	0	“ Thank you . You guys are great , ”
73921	73924	73906	73906	I	0	“ Emmett . ”
73936	73939	73925	73925	I	0	“ Hey . ”
73940	73943	73944	73944	She	75	“ Hi . ”
73969	73975	73961	73961	she	75	“ You alright , sweetie ? ”
73976	73983	73925	73925	I	0	“ Yeah . What ’s up ? ”
73984	74010	74011	74011	Britt	75	“ Well , we ’ve got Dr. Richards on deck in twenty , and the Kelley family will be standing beside him during the speech , ”
74014	74049	74050	74050	she	75	“ So wherever you are in about ten minutes , make sure I can find you because I need you onstage to introduce all five people . You have your notes ready , right ? ”
74069	74072	74073	74073	I	0	“ Yes , ”
74086	74093	74094	74094	Britt	75	“ I do . Sounds good . ”
74100	74126	74127	74127	she	75	“ You sure you alright , Emmett ? You seem anxious – despite the fact that you know I ’ve got you covered , babe , ”
74141	74160	74127	74127	she	75	“ Come on , Emmett . Have you ever had to worry when I ’m running your shit ? ”
74175	74178	74167	74167	I	0	“ No . ”
74179	74184	74185	74185	Britt	75	“ That ’s right , ”
74199	74208	74167	74167	I	0	“ Oop . Ca n’t do that now . ”
74209	74212	74167	74167	I	0	“ Why ? ”
74213	74229	74230	74230	she	75	“ Because no one needs to see me getting all hot and bothered right now , ”
74240	74266	74230	74230	she	75	“ Not the most professional look in the world . Even if it ’s common knowledge that you ’re the sexiest man in the room . ”
74289	74301	74282	74282	Britt	75	“ So … still have n’t gotten a hold of Aly ? ”
74302	74308	74282	74282	Britt	75	“ She ’s running late . ”
74309	74313	74314	74314	Britt	75	“ Very late , ”
74346	74357	74344	74344	Aly	43	“ I ’m going to step out to call her . ”
74358	74361	74362	74362	Britt	75	“ Babe . ”
74371	74408	74409	74409	she	75	“ You really do n’t have the time for that . You have to be on stage soon , so if you ’re not okay , we can take a minute somewhere and calm you down , ”
74419	74437	74438	74438	she	75	“ Whatever way you need to decompress , you know I ’m more than happy to help , ”
74445	74452	74438	74438	she	75	“ In whatever way you need . ”
74494	74500	74501	74501	Britt	75	“ What do you say ? ”
74575	74585	74586	74586	I	0	“ Thanks , Britt , but I ’m good , ”
74681	74695	74696	74696	Dev	155	“ You ’re used to Julian doing this part , are n’t you ? ”
74699	74711	74696	74696	Dev	155	“ Yeah , but he deserves a break this year since – ”
74744	74747	74741	74741	John	154	“ Whoa . ”
74836	74846	74829	74829	I	0	“ Welp . There goes our chance , Dev . ”
74847	74858	74859	74859	I	0	“ Yep , we lost him . It ’s over . ”
75007	75027	75000	75000	she	43	“ Emmett , I had an emergency with Evie and Mike – I ’m so sorry I ’m late . ”
75028	75041	75042	75042	I	0	“ You ’re here now . That ’s all I care about , ”
75176	75179	75180	75180	she	43	“ Baby , ”
75187	75191	75180	75180	she	43	“ What happened ? ”
75271	75282	75283	75283	I	0	“ I do n’t … even know where to start , ”
75296	75322	75283	75283	I	0	“ But I promise I ’ll explain it soon . Not now , but tonight , when all this is over . Is that okay ? ”
75323	75327	75328	75328	Aly	43	“ Of course , ”
75352	75361	75362	75362	she	43	“ Emmett , everyone ’s staring at us , ”
75370	75373	75374	75374	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
75377	75380	75374	75374	I	0	“ Who ? ”
75381	75403	75342	75342	she	43	“ Everyone . Julian . Sara . Drew . Britt ’s looking at me like she wants to eat my head . ”
75404	75410	75374	75374	I	0	“ Yeah , ignore that . ”
75411	75431	75374	75374	I	0	“ Your mom though . And my parents – oh my God . My mom ’s face right now . ”
75432	75451	75452	75452	I	0	“ I take it now ’s not the time to ask for a kiss then , is it ? ”
75493	75525	75488	75488	I	0	“ Um , I feel like kissing now would be a big statement to everyone , which I ’m not sure you want to make at an event of this caliber , ”
75558	75568	75543	75543	she	1038	“ You want it now , do n’t you ? ”
75569	75593	75594	75594	She	1038	“ Yeah . I have to be on stage for awhile and I feel like I need the re - up on energy . ”
75607	75610	75611	75611	she	1038	“ Fine , ”
75663	75670	75671	75671	I	0	“ Jesus . Was that Drew ? ”
75693	75701	75702	75702	Aly	43	“ Yeah . That was definitely Drew , ”
75716	75740	75702	75702	Aly	43	“ And now a very pissy Britt is coming to collect you for your speech , I think , so you should go . ”
75741	75744	75745	75745	I	0	“ Fine , ”
75754	75763	75745	75745	I	0	“ But I ’ll get you right after . ”
75764	75768	75769	75769	she	1038	“ You better , ”
75783	75812	75745	75745	I	0	“ Because our parents are looking at me like they need an explanation STAT , and I ’m not having those talks with them all on my own . ”
75863	75876	75877	75877	she	41	“ Emmett , I feel like my heart is going to burst , ”
75907	75910	75902	75902	she	41	“ Mom ! ”
75921	75925	75926	75926	Mom	41	“ Happy tears ! ”
75940	75958	75930	75930	her	41	“ They ’re happy tears ! I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to startle anyone . ”
76095	76107	76108	76108	Mom	41	“ Oh , Charlie ’s coming over with Donna and Aly , ”
76190	76208	76209	76209	Julian	39	“ It ’s supposed to be a surprise because she likes having the upper hand on me , ”
76258	76271	76272	76272	he	128	“ Well , you know you ca n’t have that , Julian , ”
76283	76302	76272	76272	he	128	“ It ’s got ta be the man with the upper hand . That ’s why it rhymes . ”
76355	76373	76374	76374	Aly	43	“ Anyway , can we please talk about the fact that you won my daughter ’s heart ? ”
76385	76400	76374	76376	Aly ’s mom	41	“ From what I recall , you two defined the word rivalry growing up . ”
76401	76408	76409	76409	Charlie	128	“ Rivalry implies there was competition , ”
76416	76429	76409	76409	Charlie	128	“ And I do n’t think it was ever a close race . ”
76487	76496	76474	76474	Aly	43	“ I did n’t mean anything by it ! ”
76515	76520	76505	76505	he	189	“ ruining a good time ”
76522	76527	76505	76505	he	189	“ getting all serious . ”
76551	76561	76562	76562	I	0	“ What do you mean by that , Charlie ? ”
76598	76615	76582	76582	he	128	“ What do you mean what do I mean about it ? It was a joke . ”
76616	76649	76650	76650	I	0	“ Well , can you explain it ? Because ‘ it was a joke ’ seems to be your fallback line when you know you ca n’t back up something you said , ”
76724	76752	76753	76753	Sara	391	“ Argh , my friends have all been ! But I have n’t yet because Julian keeps waiting for a day when we can go with Emmett , ”
76756	76770	76771	76771	She	391	“ But I have seriously been craving a lobster roll like no other . ”
76781	76793	76771	76771	She	391	“ I think baby ’s got fancy taste . Like Daddy . ”
76794	76802	76803	76803	Julian	39	“ Pretty sure that ’s all you , ”
76821	76864	76865	76865	she	391	“ You know what I want ? I ’m trying to find the picture of that Bloody Mary you have , Aly . I saw it on this food website , and I took a screenshot , but where did it go ? ”
76875	76889	76865	76865	she	391	“ The Hail Mary – that ’s what you ’re famous for right ? ”
76890	76902	76903	76903	Aly	43	“ Well , it ’s definitely that and the lobster roll , ”
76906	76915	76903	76903	Aly	43	“ They ’re definitely the two most popular – ”
76916	76923	76924	76924	Charlie	128	“ Thank Emmett for that one , ”
76927	76938	76939	76939	he	128	“ You said he saved her liquor license , right ? ”
76949	76966	76967	76968	Jesus Christ	39	“ Well , thank God for that , or you would ’ve lost all your business . ”
76970	76973	76974	76974	Julian	39	“ Easy , ”
76981	76991	76992	76992	Aly	43	“ We ’ve been out of the drink before , ”
76995	77001	76992	76992	Aly	43	“ And we still survived . ”
77002	77027	76992	76992	Aly	43	“ Yeah , for one day , sure . But the whole summer ? Kiss that restaurant goodbye . Just like I told ya . ”
77055	77110	77111	77111	she	43	“ Dad , we all know you though the restaurant was a bad idea , but it ’s been kicking ass this whole summer , and it ’s the food , not the liquor sales that have been driving so much business back to the warehouse . So lay off a bit , huh ? ”
77114	77123	77124	77124	She	43	“ ‘ Cause ya seem a little jealous . ”
77184	77188	77189	77189	Charlie	128	“ ball busting , ”
77518	77521	77508	77508	Charlie	128	“ Leaving ? ”
77529	77535	77536	77536	He	128	“ Should I get Donna ? ”
77567	77578	77579	77579	he	128	“ Hey , I thought of a funny joke before , ”
77582	77585	77579	77579	he	128	“ What ? ”
77586	77608	77609	77609	I	0	“ You know how this is a fundraiser ? I thought well , you ’re being very charitable by dating Aly . ”
77626	77648	77579	77579	he	128	“ I would n’t say that . I can promise you she ’s not the lucky one , it ’s me . ”
77649	77670	77671	77671	Charlie	128	“ Jesus , Emmett . You ’re not gon na ask me for her hand in marriage , are you ? ”
77674	77698	77699	77699	He	128	“ Because you might want to think on that . You could be dating any one of these pretty girls here next week . ”
77708	77744	77699	77699	He	128	“ That one . That one . Blonde one . Tall one . Not everyone can be Emmett Hoult so do n’t ask me something crazy right now . I do n’t wanna hear it . ”
77745	77756	77757	77757	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m not asking you for that , ”
77775	77845	77846	77846	I	0	“ I do n’t need your permission for whenever I decide to propose . I ’m going to eventually , and when I want to , I will . I just thought I should say now that if you ca n’t get past that famous ego of yours and treat Aly with the respect she deserves , then you wo n’t have a role in any of our lives , ”
77878	77926	77874	77874	I	0	“ She bailed you out , Charlie . She did everything you could n’t do with that company , and if you ’re hell - bent on pretending that never happened , then out of respect for my father , I ’ll say goodbye to you here , ”
77959	77972	77973	77973	he	128	“ You ’re not gon na wind up marrying her , Emmett , ”
78088	78101	78102	78102	I	0	“ They do n’t trust you . You look way too tired , ”
78144	78147	78148	78148	he	1603	“ Baby , ”
78174	78177	78163	78163	he	1603	“ Exhausted ? ”
78178	78181	78182	78182	he	1603	“ Yes , ”
78193	78199	78182	78182	he	1603	“ Ready to go home ? ”
78200	78229	78163	78163	he	1603	“ Yes . But I have to wait for John and Dev to finish something . If you ’re tired though I ’ll call you a car first . ”
78230	78240	78241	78241	I	0	“ No , I ’d rather wait for you , ”
78256	78267	78268	78268	I	0	“ I could use a couple explanations from you anyway , ”
78282	78289	78290	78290	My	0	“ I ’m sorry , Emmett . ”
78306	78321	78299	78299	his	1603	“ I just need to know . Where were you the past two days ? ”
78336	78342	78328	78328	I	0	“ Were you with Drea ? ”
78343	78346	78347	78347	He	1603	“ Huh ? ”
78354	78364	78347	78347	He	1603	“ No . Why would I be with Drea ? ”
78365	78369	78370	78370	I	0	“ I thought … ”
78403	78415	78416	78416	Emmett	1603	“ Aly , I promise you I ’ve never dated Drea , ”
78419	78460	78461	78461	I	0	“ I ’ve only ever had one ex and it was a girl from college named Kristy . I do n’t even remember if it was spelled with a K or a C anymore , it was that long ago . ”
78484	78514	78515	78515	I	0	“ I thought you said that everything was great about you two . I mean when you ended , you were heartbroken enough to vow to never commit again , ”
78532	78539	78540	78540	I	0	“ Did I interpret that wrong ? ”
78543	78548	78549	78549	he	1603	“ I think yes , ”
78553	78562	78563	78563	Emmett	1603	“ Then why did you stop dating her ? ”
78574	78604	78567	78567	he	1603	“ Because my mom was going through another break . And I had to be there for her to make sure she did n’t try to hurt herself again . ”
78617	78626	78610	78610	I	0	“ Hurt herself ? What do you mean – ”
78627	78642	78643	78643	Emmett	1603	“ After Dad died , and after Julian moved away ... things were bad . ”
78653	78706	78648	78648	he	1603	“ And one morning … it was probably 6AM when Gram called me crying so hysterically I started driving right over in my pajamas because I could n’t get words out of her . I had no idea what she was saying and at some point , she just dropped the phone . ”
78712	78716	78648	78648	he	1603	“ What happened ? ”
78717	78725	78726	78726	My	0	“ My mom tried to kill herself . ”
78733	78736	78726	78726	My	0	“ What ? ”
78737	78743	78744	78744	Emmett	1603	“ Julian does n’t know , ”
78754	78760	78744	78744	Emmett	1603	“ And he ca n’t . ”
78761	78766	78726	78726	My	0	“ What – why ? ”
78767	78774	78775	78775	he	1603	“ Because he ’ll blame himself , ”
78785	78871	78775	78775	he	1603	“ He already blamed himself for Dad and he still does to this day . He ’s gotten way better since meeting Sara , and she ’s made a world of difference in the way he handles this part of his life , but I do n’t want to risk the bad times coming back . He already wo n’t forgive himself for being gone for so long – he definitely does n’t need to know exactly how bad things were when he was away . ”
78872	78892	78917	78917	Emmett	1603	“ So he … never even knew your mom did this ? You never called him when it happened ? ”
78893	78916	78917	78917	Emmett	1603	“ She would n’t let me . And Gram told me we should just do what we could to keep her calm , ”
78920	78953	78917	78917	Emmett	1603	“ And I was eighteen when this happened – I did n’t know how to handle something like this . I know I made mistakes but I was learning along the way . ”
78954	78959	78960	78960	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
78979	78984	78985	78985	I	0	“ You were eighteen , ”
78994	79022	78985	78985	I	0	“ But … wait . I do n’t understand how you drove over so fast . You were in college at this point and your mom was – ”
79023	79059	78985	78985	I	0	“ She still had the Upper East Side townhouse , but pretty much right after Julian left , she moved to be near me . She and Gram rented this little apartment near my campus . ”
79060	79064	78985	78985	I	0	“ In Philly ? ”
79065	79068	78985	78985	I	0	“ Yes . ”
79149	79229	79230	79230	Emmett	1603	“ She did n’t tell anyone , obviously . She felt guilty and ashamed that she needed her son to take care of her . She said that was supposed to be her job , so I should n’t have to be cleaning for her and checking on her . But I had to . Gram was n’t doing the best at the time either , and if I did n’t cook for Mom , she would n’t eat , ”
79300	79309	79310	79310	Emmett	1603	“ I know . It ’s a lot , ”
79577	79588	79589	79589	he	1603	“ It ’s hard to hear all this out loud , ”
79592	79599	79589	79589	he	1603	“ Even from my own voice . ”
79600	79607	79608	79608	I	0	“ I know what you mean . ”
79619	79648	79608	79608	I	0	“ It makes you think about all the things you should ’ve done instead . Or ways you could ’ve made this easier on yourself at some point . ”
79649	79652	79653	79653	Emmett	1603	“ Definitely , ”
79656	79708	79608	79608	I	0	“ I know I should ’ve told Julian at some point . But half the reason she fell into that place was because of him , and even after he came back for good , I did n’t know how to say so many years ’ worth of shit to him . ”
79709	79731	79608	79608	I	0	“ So when she has these breaks now … you do n’t let him know even a little what ’s happening ? ”
79732	79776	79608	79608	I	0	“ No . There ’s no point in upsetting him when I ’m the only one who can help . I ’ve been there since the beginning . I know all her ticks and patterns . All the tricks to calm her down . ”
79777	79786	79608	79608	I	0	“ How often does she have these breaks ? ”
79787	79845	79608	79608	I	0	“ Not as often now . They ’ve been less and less frequent over the years . But in the beginning , there were times when I ’d be living with her and Gram for weeks , maybe a month at a time because that was how long it took to pull her out of these places . ”
79846	79871	79608	79608	I	0	“ So you did n’t do relationships because you felt like … you were on call for her ? In case she broke down ? ”
79872	79875	79876	79876	Emmett	1603	“ Yeah . ”
79896	79905	79906	79906	I	0	“ But … what if you ’re away ? ”
79921	79940	79941	79941	Emmett	1603	“ I do n’t go away for too long . Never more than a week at a time , ”
79944	80004	79941	79941	Emmett	1603	“ I know if something were to happen and she fell into one of these places , she would n’t tell me if I were on vacation . She ’d want me to enjoy myself . But that ’s not worth it because when I catch her early enough , I can talk her down before things gets bad . ”
80005	80008	80009	80009	I	0	“ Right , ”
80054	80066	80067	80067	I	0	“ So that ’s where you were the past two days , ”
80073	80078	80067	80067	I	0	“ What triggered it ? ”
80079	80082	80083	80083	he	1603	“ Sara , ”
80095	80103	80104	80104	I	0	“ Well not Sara . Her pregnancy . ”
80109	80118	80104	80104	I	0	“ Your mom is n’t happy about it ? ”
80119	80135	80136	80136	Emmett	1603	“ Oh , she ’s ecstatic . Julian said she cried for an hour straight , ”
80144	80225	80226	80226	he	1603	“ But I think … there ’s a fine line between her being really happy and really sad . I think a lot of times when she ’s over the moon about something , she misses my dad . And with Sara being pregnant , I know she ’s just wishing more than ever for him to be here . We were all torn apart the day he died but look at us now . We ’re rolling deep again , ”
80235	80248	80249	80249	He	1603	“ We ’ve got Sara now . We got a baby coming . ”
80253	80264	80265	80265	he	1603	“ I ’ve got pretty good prospects in my life , ”
80287	80314	80282	80282	he	1603	“ It ’s everything Dad wanted . And I know Mom ’s just hurting about the fact that he ca n’t be here to see it . ”
80315	80319	80320	80320	I	0	“ Of course , ”
80392	80403	80404	80404	I	0	“ I wish I could ’ve been there for you , ”
80412	80457	80404	80404	I	0	“ I know things were weird between us , but I ’ve always felt like you were my family . I know it ’s hard to believe , but I do n’t think I would have let you go through something like this alone . ”
80458	80466	80467	80467	Emmett	1603	“ I know you would n’t have . ”
80473	80488	80467	80467	Emmett	1603	“ You understood me and my family more than anyone else in the world . ”
80489	80499	80500	80500	I	0	“ So I should ’ve been there for you , ”
80531	80537	80538	80538	he	1603	“ You ’re here now , ”
80541	80549	80538	80538	he	1603	“ And that ’s all that matters . ”
81005	81008	81009	81009	He	1603	“ Mmph . ”
81036	81054	81055	81055	He	1603	“ I ’m trying to sleep , baby , what are you – ah … holy fuck . ”
81276	81283	81284	81284	I	0	“ Oh my God , Emmett , ”
81377	81384	81385	81385	Emmett	1603	“ Tell me you want it , ”
81393	81403	81385	81385	Emmett	1603	“ Tell me you want my cum inside you . ”
81404	81418	81419	81419	I	0	“ Give it to me , Emmett . I want to feel it , ”
81860	81864	81865	81865	I	0	“ Oh shit ! ”
81874	81877	81865	81865	I	0	“ Crap ! ”
82102	82110	82113	82113	Emmett	1603	“ Should I call the fire department ? ”
82224	82232	82219	82219	he	1603	“ What are you doing , Aly ? ”
82233	82245	82246	82246	He	1603	“ I was looking for something to wave at the alarm . ”
82252	82258	82259	82259	he	1603	“ What did you find ? ”
82292	82300	82301	82301	My	0	“ How do you know this company ? ”
82318	82338	82339	82339	Emmett	1603	“ This is the company that invested in me three years ago . So I could open my restaurant . ”
82465	82478	82479	82479	I	0	“ Were you the one who invested in my company , Emmett ? ”
82493	82509	82479	82479	I	0	“ I ’m not trying to fight , I just need you to answer me , ”
82526	82529	82519	82519	he	1603	“ Yes . ”
82686	82696	82680	82680	I	0	“ You never told me how you knew her . ”
82697	82700	82680	82680	I	0	“ Who ? ”
82701	82704	82705	82705	My	0	“ Drea . ”
82715	82734	82705	82705	My	0	“ So I need you to tell me now , Emmett . Tell me how you know Drea . ”
82735	82741	82742	82742	he	1603	“ We ’re work acquaintances , ”
82754	82776	82742	82742	he	1603	“ I ’m an investor with The Victorian . Her restaurant group manages the bar at the top of that hotel . ”
82777	82785	82705	82705	My	0	“ How long have you known her ? ”
82786	82790	82791	82791	His	1603	“ Five years . ”
82820	82835	82836	82836	I	0	“ Were you the reason I got hired at Vandermark Restaurants four years ago ? ”
82843	82846	82836	82836	I	0	“ Yes . ”
82866	82869	82847	82847	I	0	“ Aly . ”
82880	82892	82893	82893	he	1603	“ I did n’t think I ’d see you ever again , ”
82905	82976	82977	82977	he	1603	“ I tried reaching out so many times , but you did n’t answer . You know I did n’t regret what I did , but I hated everything that happened after . I hated that your dad sent you away . I knew from your mom that you felt lost for so many years after , and I felt like I took so much of your life from you , ”
83097	83112	83113	83113	I	0	“ Emmett , why ? Why did you feel the need to do this ? ”
83152	83264	83142	83142	I	0	“ Because I wanted to fix things . I wanted to make up for all the pain I caused you . I knew you were still hurting from what happened , and I knew from both your mom and mine what you were up to here and there . I always kept an ear out for what you were doing because I wanted to know that whatever it was , you were happy . And that you ’d moved on okay . When my mom told me you were having trouble getting hired , I asked where , she said Vandermark , and I made one call – that was it . ”
83265	83280	83281	83281	I	0	“ It ’s not as simple as you ’re making it out to be , ”
83285	83312	83281	83281	I	0	“ I thought these were all things that happened organically . I thought I had made these things happen . I thought Drea was my friend . ”
83313	83319	83320	83320	Emmett	1603	“ She is your friend , ”
83323	83372	83320	83320	Emmett	1603	“ A company like that is n’t going to hold onto an employee who is n’t working out for them . They ’re too big and impatient for that , so when I say I only made a call , I promise you that ’s all I did . ”
83373	83386	83281	83281	I	0	“ You knew from Drea that I wanted to open a restaurant . ”
83387	83400	83320	83320	Emmett	1603	“ I could ’ve found out just as easily from my mom . ”
83401	83415	83416	83416	I	0	“ You did n’t have to be the one to invest in me , ”
83419	83437	83438	83438	Emmett	1603	“ No , I did n’t , but I wanted you to have everything you needed faster , ”
83441	83459	83460	83460	I	0	“ I wanted to make your life easy for once . So you could just be happy . ”
83478	83484	83470	83470	I	0	“ Who knows about this ? ”
83485	83493	83494	83494	Emmett	1603	“ No one but my business partner , ”
83498	83517	83518	83518	I	0	“ Julian does n’t know . My mom definitely does n’t . Your dad will never find out . ”
83599	83604	83584	83584	I	0	“ Aly , please . ”
83605	83617	83618	83618	I	0	“ I know this came from a good place , Emmett . ”
83628	83638	83639	83639	He	1603	“ I know you did this because you cared . ”
84123	84153	84115	84116	the commentators	1138	“ You know , Joe , you look at this bases - loaded jam the Empires are in and you just wish Drew Maddox were still on the mound . ”
84154	84164	84115	84116	the commentators	1138	“ Well , he should ’ve controlled his temper . ”
84165	84173	84115	84116	the commentators	1138	“ You ’re not wrong about that . ”
84174	84181	84115	84116	the commentators	1138	“ Shoulda , woulda , coulda … ”
84182	84192	84193	84193	Drew	298	“ The fuck ? That asshole charged the mound ! ”
84217	84222	84223	84223	he	298	“ Goddammit , Griff ! ”
84263	84265	84259	84259	I	0	“ damn ”
84284	84295	84296	84296	he	298	“ Are you pretending to be mad for my sake ? ”

86135	86174	86083	86083	she	43	“ Yeah , but you only had one job then . Two jobs with only two hours of sleep a night is different , and that difference is you collapsing one day in the middle of this kitchen . ”

86893	86896	86873	86873	she	43	“ What ? ”

86972	86987	86988	86988	Evie	43	“ I really think we might be better now . After the last fight , ”
87108	87122	87123	87123	Evie	43	“ Do you mind that I told Mike that Emmett was our investor ? ”
87139	87150	87151	87151	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I think I do , ”
87155	87206	87207	87207	I	0	“ But mostly because I ’m paranoid that the wrong people will find out that Emmett Hoult funded my career . I know you had to tell him . He ’s your fiancé and I know he wo n’t like , randomly call up my dad and spill the beans , ”
87233	87252	87253	87253	I	0	“ For what it ’s worth , he thinks Emmett was just trying to be a good guy . ”
87262	87291	87292	87292	I	0	“ I know . But it does n’t change the fact that I ’ll never be able to look at my own achievements without having to credit him , ”

87308	87341	87342	87342	Evie	43	“ Well , if it makes you feel better , Emmett Hoult is also my investor , and I do n’t feel any less proud of myself for what I ’ve achieved , ”
87357	87436	87292	87292	I	0	“ Granted I do n’t have the same history you have with him , but if you can somehow forget that for a second and pretend he ’s just some faceless investor like we initially thought , we did do a shit ton of work on our own . Having money does n’t mean you can just make a business happen . You have to have a good idea and you have to know how to use it . ”
87437	87442	87443	87443	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
87446	87463	87443	87443	I	0	“ He also had Drea van Dahl hire me when I did n’t necessarily deserve it . ”
87464	87493	87494	87494	Evie	43	“ So what ? It ’s like ... weird nepotism . He was basically giving you a taste of all the privilege he himself has had in life , ”
87497	87548	87494	87494	Evie	43	“ He missed you , Aly . He could n’t take care of you in person , so he tried to do it from afar . That ’s what people are supposed to do when they love you . They do whatever they can to make sure you ’re okay . ”
87549	87560	87561	87561	I	0	“ Well , he did n’t love me yet then , ”
87565	87615	87561	87561	I	0	“ This was four years ago that he got involved in my life . I think he probably just had too much time and money on his hands , he heard I was having trouble , and he just dunked some money in me to relieve his own conscience . ”
87616	87631	87494	87494	Evie	43	“ Holy crap , you are cynical . Can I get you more wine ? ”
87632	87651	87561	87561	I	0	“ No , Evie . We have work in seven hours and we ca n’t be hung over . ”
87652	87686	87561	87561	I	0	“ Then will you please just look at this video of a dog cradling a baby ? My mom just posted it on my wall and it ’s making my ovaries do things . ”

88453	88479	88442	88442	she	43	“ Oh , it totally does , but it ’s more important for me to be awake there than it is for me to steady , ”

89159	89186	89187	89187	she	43	“ Yeah ! But maybe you did n’t realize it was me ? I changed my name to initials so my employers ca n’t find me , ”
89190	89265	89187	89187	she	43	“ But yeah , I saw that notification and was like , ‘ whoa . Blast from the past . ’ And your profile did n’t have any new info on it so I may or may not have Googled you and found a bunch of articles about this place – which is amazing by the way . Holy shit , woman ! What ’s this about the lobster roll and the Blood Mary ? ”

I know it feels like I stole all your achievements from the past three , four years – but you need to know that you did all this on your own . If it were n’t me , it would ’ve been someone else investing in you because you ’re fucking brilliant . You ’re smart and you ’re passionate , and before I found my business partner , I promise you I invested in more than a dozen restaurants that closed before a year because they did n’t have your drive .
