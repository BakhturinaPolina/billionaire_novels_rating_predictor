394	403	404	405	the cabbie	218	" You said Lower East Side , miss ? ”
411	421	404	405	the cabbie	218	“ Yes , Ludlow Street , right below Houston . ”
1336	1360	1361	1361	I	1543	“ Lia , we ’re officially in the same building – ca n’t this wait till I meet you up on the roof ? ”
1415	1483	1502	1502	She	244	“ No , Sara , it can not wait , because you strung me along all night with your cryptic - ass texts and now that I finally know what the heck is going on , I ’m drunk and I ’m excited and I ’m ready to butter up some hotties for you so they ’re nice and warm by the time you get up here ! ”
1484	1496	1571	1573	my best friend	222	“ Oh , that just sounds … so creepy , Lia . ”
1497	1501	1502	1502	She	244	“ Did it ? ”
1509	1561	1502	1502	She	244	“ I guess so . Lukas is giving me the weirdest look right now . But whatever , it ’s not your night , Lukas – I ’m talking to Lukas right now – it ’s Sara ’s night . Right , Sara ? I ’m talking to you right now . ”
1584	1592	1562	1562	I	1543	“ Sure , drunkie , it is . ”
1593	1637	1644	1644	Lia	1543	“ Exactly . So listen . I was talking to this guy just now who is a solid nine – do n’t look at me like that , Lukas – and he is a total sweetheart . Like , such a nice person . ”
1638	1643	1562	1562	I	1543	“ Uh - huh . ”
1759	1766	1779	1779	Lia	1543	“ ass that wo n’t quit , ”
1802	1807	1808	1808	I	1543	“ Lia – listen , ”
1812	1842	1808	1808	I	1543	“ I appreciate your tip , and I love you very much , but I do n’t think a cat dad sweetheart is what I ’m looking for tonight . ”
1843	1848	1779	1779	Lia	1543	“ What ? Why ? ”
1849	1856	1857	1857	I	1543	“ Is this a serious question ? ”
1868	1882	1857	1857	I	1543	“ And do we really need to be having this conversation right now ? ”
1883	1918	1919	1919	Lia	1543	“ Yes , Sara , it ’s a serious question , because I ’m drunk , and when I ’m drunk , I have comprehension issues , which makes every question a serious question , ”
1939	1983	1919	1919	Lia	1543	“ Now explain to me why you do n’t want the nice guy I picked for you when I already told him all about you , and please tell me why you keep trying to get off the phone with me all night ! ”
1984	1987	1988	1988	I	1543	“ Because , ”
1991	2153	2154	2154	I	1543	“ For starters , I just spent the past however many years having a bunch of okay sex with a guy I was the bare minimum of attracted to , so tonight I specifically do n’t want that kind of sex . I want good , sweaty … kind of mean sex with a man who ’ll just pin me down and … fuck me so hard he breaks the headboard . And to answer your second question , I want to get off the phone because I do n’t want to talk about the mind - blowing sex I ’m going to have tonight , I just want to have it . Thinking about it is turning me on to the point of torture right now and being on the phone with you while I ’m this insane level of horny actually feels kind of weird , so will you please just let me get in the elevator , Li ? ”
2165	2178	2154	2154	I	1543	“ Because it ’s here , I ’m in , and I – ”
2240	2243	2244	2244	I	1543	“ Um . ”
2346	2349	2350	2350	He	259	“ Hi . ”
2376	2379	2365	2365	he	259	“ Hi . ”
2505	2508	2509	2509	I	1543	“ So ... ”
2529	2533	2518	2518	he	259	“ Were you … ”
2541	2554	2555	2555	I	1543	“ Were you there for the entirety of that conversation ? Downstairs ? ”
2616	2619	2620	2620	He	259	“ No . ”
2627	2643	2620	2620	He	259	“ Just long enough to hear about how hard you want to get fucked tonight . ”
2649	2652	2653	2653	I	1543	“ Right , ”
2664	2704	2653	2653	I	1543	“ In my defense , I just had a bit of a catastrophic day , and tomorrow ’s probably going to be worse . So I ’m giving myself basically the next ten hours to do whatever I want . ”
2705	2709	2710	2710	He	259	“ Ten hours . ”
2715	2724	2710	2710	He	259	“ That ’s not a lot of time . ”
2739	2750	2710	2710	He	259	“ That ’s okay . I ’m a simple girl . ”
2786	2803	2751	2751	My	1543	“ I ’m not so sure that ’s the word I ’d use to describe you . ”
2814	2821	2809	2809	I	1543	“ No ? Why is that ? ”
2822	2828	2876	2876	God	1543	“ Simple implies easily explained . ”
2829	2835	2809	2809	I	1543	“ Which I ’m not ? ”
2860	2875	2876	2876	God	1543	“ No . I already have … more than a few questions about you . ”
2919	2925	2926	2926	I	1543	“ What kind of questions ? ”
2936	2961	2926	2926	I	1543	“ You do n’t have to be shy . Like I said , it ’s a fuck - it kind of night for me . ”
2965	2974	2962	2962	He	259	“ You sure about what you ’re saying ? ”
2992	2995	3054	3054	Jesus	1543	“ Yes . ”
2996	3020	3021	3021	he	259	“ Then I guess I ’m just wondering how a girl who looks like you has trouble getting someone to pin her down , ”
3025	3052	3021	3021	he	259	“ and fuck her as hard as she wants . Pretty sure any straight man would be happy to sacrifice a headboard or two for that . ”
3147	3161	3162	3162	I	1543	“ What do … what do you mean someone who looks like me ? ”
3166	3178	3142	3142	I	1543	“ Do n’t be coy . You know what I mean . ”
3182	3208	3179	3179	I	1543	“ I want to say I do , but I feel like I need to confirm , because this all feels very surreal right now . ”
3251	3269	3270	3270	He	1493	“ Fine . I meant that you ’re not just some average cute girl . You ’re … ”
3287	3302	3278	3278	he	1493	“ Hot . Really fucking hot . The kind that makes men feel urgent . ”
3303	3307	3270	3270	He	1493	“ Urgent how ? ”
3318	3344	3308	3308	He	1493	“ Like they need to jerk or fuck the image of you out of their head . Does that paint a clear picture for you ? ”
3348	3351	3345	3345	I	1543	“ Fairly . ”
3352	3357	3358	3358	he	1493	“ Any more questions ? ”
3361	3364	3365	3365	I	1543	“ Possibly , ”
3369	3372	3345	3345	I	1543	“ Like ? ”
3378	3387	3373	3373	I	1543	“ Would you consider yourself among those men ? ”
3393	3424	3446	3446	Double	82	“ Considering I mentally fucked you in four different positions before you so much as laid eyes on me , I ’d be inclined to say the answer is yes . ”
3436	3445	3446	3446	Double	82	“ And which position did you like best ? ”
3459	3482	3446	3446	Double	82	“ I liked the one where I had you bent over the sink so I could watch everything bounce in the mirror . ”
3490	3505	3446	3446	Double	82	“ But you straddling me to ride my cock was a very close second . ”
3588	3596	3597	3597	he	1493	“ I think you missed your floor , ”
3616	3625	3597	3597	he	1493	“ I guess I ’ll go to yours . ”
3746	3750	3751	3751	His	1493	“ So sweet . ”
3902	3905	3906	3906	I	1543	“ Enough . ”
3927	3942	3943	3943	I	1543	“ Do n’t tease me . I need you inside me already – please , ”
4019	4025	4026	4026	I	1543	“ Take it off first . ”
4029	4032	4026	4026	I	1543	“ What ? ”
4033	4050	4026	4026	I	1543	“ I want to watch you play with your tits . Then we ’ll go in . ”
4128	4134	4116	4116	He	266	“ Play with your nipples . ”
4182	4191	4192	4192	I	1543	“ God , just take me inside already , ”
4277	4287	4288	4288	he	266	“ Christ . It just gets better and better , ”
4343	4346	4330	4330	he	266	“ Fuck . ”
4388	4391	4378	4378	I	1543	“ More . ”
4392	4397	4398	4398	His	266	“ What was that ? ”
4403	4408	4378	4378	I	1543	“ I want more . ”
4455	4460	4478	4478	he	266	“ Mmmm ... God ! ”
4486	4497	4498	4498	he	266	“ Christ , you ’re getting me so fucking hard , ”
4501	4510	4498	4498	he	266	“ Look at how fucking sexy you are . ”
4636	4641	4642	4642	I	1543	“ Squeeze them hard , ”
4645	4649	4642	4642	I	1543	“ My pleasure . ”
4700	4703	4704	4704	I	1543	“ More , ”
4790	4802	4786	4786	his	266	“ Did you just come all over my hand , beautiful ? ”
4803	4806	4807	4807	I	1543	“ Yes , ”
4859	4872	4873	4873	I	1543	“ I should be wet enough that you ’ll fit easily now , ”
4879	4885	4886	4886	He	266	“ What did you say ? ”
4920	4932	4933	4933	he	266	“ And here I thought I could n’t get any harder , ”
5099	5105	5112	5112	his	266	“ What are you doing ? ”
5207	5211	5212	5212	he	266	“ Do it , ”
5225	5235	5236	5236	he	266	“ Suck on it . Fucking hell , please , ”
5239	5250	5236	5236	he	266	“ Let me feel your beautiful mouth on my cock . ”
5295	5300	5330	5330	Omigod	84	“ Oh my God ! ”
5322	5325	5318	5318	his	266	“ Motherfucker ! ”
5825	5830	5831	5831	Turner	319	“ Hey , Hoult , ”
5837	5849	5831	5831	Turner	319	“ I got a pretty girl who wants to say hi . ”
5883	5886	5850	5850	I	1543	“ Yeah ? ”
5887	5909	5910	5910	he	319	“ Yeah – listen , it ’s her twentieth birthday today and it ’s also her first time at Empire Stadium , ”
5944	5976	5977	5977	Turner	319	“ Do n’t you , uh … do n’t you think she should get a nice tour from the owner of the American League champs ? A nice , personal tour ? ”
6021	6032	6006	6010	the bright - eyed girl	303	“ You know , I did just have a thought . ”
6038	6041	6033	6033	His	319	“ Yeah ? ”
6042	6045	6046	6046	I	1543	“ Yeah . ”
6055	6091	6046	6046	I	1543	“ I was thinking we should take a trip out to the Biarritz property . You could get an in - person look at our clientele and all the improvements we ’ve made since the – ”
6092	6102	6103	6103	Turner	319	“ Ah , fuck , you ’re talking business . ”
6123	6147	6110	6110	I	1543	“ Jesus , man . I got excited for a second . I thought you were about to suggest we do some blow . ”
6148	6155	6156	6156	I	1543	“ This is a family ballpark , ”
6159	6164	6165	6165	I	1543	“ You fucking animal , ”
6201	6210	6211	6211	Turner	319	“ Alright , easy . This guy here , ”
6214	6232	6233	6233	He	319	“ So , fine . No blow . But will you please be a gentleman and take … ”
6241	6244	6245	6245	she	226	“ Hayley , ”
6248	6267	6268	6268	He	319	“ Hayley . Will you please take Hayley for a tour around the ballpark while I talk to ... ”
6280	6283	6268	6268	He	319	“ Cass . ”
6284	6287	6288	6288	Turner	319	“ Cass , ”
6292	6303	6304	6304	he	319	“ How could I forget ? Cass with the ass , ”
6327	6347	6322	6322	he	319	“ Give me twenty minutes tops . Then you , me and the kid will get back to work . ”
6461	6465	6466	6466	I	1543	“ Twenty minutes , ”
6471	6475	6447	6448	the blonde	304	“ Maybe thirty . ”
6476	6480	6481	6481	I	1543	“ Fifteen now , ”
6492	6497	6498	6498	Emmett	319	“ Who ’s that ? ”
6631	6637	6638	6638	I	1543	“ Her name is Hayley , ”
6652	6660	6645	6645	Hayley	89	“ I do n’t actually know her . ”
6661	6681	6640	6640	Emmett	319	“ Did n’t think so . Let me guess – you ’re babysitting her for one of the Roths . ”
6682	6685	6645	6645	Hayley	89	“ Bingo . ”
6704	6745	6686	6686	Emmett	319	“ I ’d say forget them at this point but fuck , do those assholes have everything you need . And all that power just fell into their laps . They do n’t even know what to do with it . ”
6746	6755	6686	6686	Emmett	319	“ I ’d prefer you not remind me . ”
6756	6765	6766	6766	His	319	“ Alright , let ’s change the subject . ”
6772	6789	6766	6766	His	319	“ Oh , wait , there ’s no other subject with you besides work . Right ? ”
6823	6826	6816	6816	I	1543	“ Except … ”
6827	6831	6766	6766	His	319	“ Do n’t . ”
6832	6849	6816	6816	I	1543	“ There is a topic we still have n’t gotten the chance to clear up yet . ”
6850	6856	6766	6766	His	319	“ Drop it , Emmett . ”
6857	6891	6816	6816	I	1543	“ Come on , dude . I need an explanation . Who was she ? How ’d you meet her ? I ’ve never seen you get so upset over a girl before . ”
6905	6935	6892	6892	I	1543	“ I was n’t upset over a girl . I was upset that you burst into the room while I was clearly in the middle of something with her . ”
7057	7067	7055	7055	her	317	“ I can tell you ’re thinking about her . ”
7068	7072	7055	7055	her	317	“ Fuck off . ”
7073	7076	7055	7055	her	317	“ What ? ”
7083	7101	7077	7077	I	1543	“ I almost admire your nerve to singlehandedly fuck up my night then taunt me about it . ”
7102	7119	7055	7055	her	317	“ Are you mad at me or are you mad you ’re not over it yet ? ”
7120	7123	7077	7077	I	1543	“ Both . ”
7124	7128	7129	7129	Emmett	319	“ Christ , J. ”
7140	7162	7129	7129	Emmett	319	“ It ’s not the craziest thing in the world if you think about a girl for more than one night . ”
7184	7220	7182	7182	her	320	“ Take it easy , brother . This just means you ’re human for once . Besides , it ’s New York . It ’s a small city . You ’ll run into her again . ”
7221	7245	7246	7246	I	1543	“ It ’s the fourth largest city in the world , but I appreciate your ability to always look on the bright side . ”
7252	7261	7246	7246	I	1543	“ I should get back to my suite . ”
7262	7299	7182	7182	her	320	“ Yeah , why not hurry up and wait . You ’re gon na get back there just in time to hear the Roths face - fucking twenty - year - old girls in the bathroom . ”
7303	7320	7300	7300	I	1543	“ Thank you for your colorful phrasing . And for putting that image in my head . ”
7321	7360	7300	7300	I	1543	“ Anytime . Now sit your ass down and watch this game with me . You own this damned team , you might as well try to care about them like you actually did when we were kids . ”
7403	7407	7422	7422	God	1543	“ God Bless America ”
7762	7765	7766	7766	I	1543	“ Jennifer . ”
7782	7788	7778	7778	She	333	“ Yes , Mr. Hoult ? ”
7789	7813	7766	7766	I	1543	“ I have to get back to the office , but I ’d like you to do me a favor if you can . ”
7814	7821	7778	7778	She	333	“ Yes , sir . Absolutely . ”
7822	7892	7893	7893	I	1543	“ I need you to go to my suite a few doors down . Turner Roth is the blonde - haired guy around six feet tall . He ’s wearing a blue shirt and he ’s with a girl in a yellow dress named Cass . I apologize in advance for whatever you might see them doing , but when they ’re done , will you give him this ? ”
7914	7920	7910	7910	She	335	“ Of course , sir . ”
7921	7927	7952	7952	she	335	“ Thank you , Jennifer . ”
7928	7937	7938	7938	She	335	“ You ’re very welcome , Mr. Hoult . ”
8210	8215	8216	8216	she	240	“ Oh , bubs , ”
8239	8248	8216	8216	she	240	“ all dressed up and nowhere to go . ”
8249	8260	8216	8216	she	240	“ I ’m guessing dinner did n’t go so well . ”
8266	8282	8261	8261	I	1543	“ It was … bad . And awkward . And a little sexist at times . ”
8283	8291	8216	8216	she	240	“ What ? What did he say ? ”
8292	8339	8261	8261	I	1543	“ Lots of stuff about how I should stop freaking out about being unemployed , that it ’s okay for pretty girls to not have jobs . Then something about how women are actually a burden to companies , and maternity leave is unfair to men . ”
8340	8343	8344	8344	Lia	1543	“ Wow , ”
8347	8357	8344	8344	Lia	1543	“ That ’s super charming for a first date . ”
8358	8363	8364	8364	I	1543	“ Is n’t it ? ”
8628	8641	8642	8642	Lia	1543	“ It ’s okay , girl . Onto the next , right ? ”
8649	8679	8616	8616	he	96	“ I would say that , but I think Elevator Babe might ’ve ruined my taste in men forever . The bar ’s been set way too high now . ”
8680	8689	8690	8690	Lia	1543	“ He was really that good - looking ? ”
8700	8750	8694	8694	I	1543	“ He was literally the best - looking person I ’ve ever laid eyes on in my life . In fact , I ’m pretty sure he ’s the best - looking person anyone has ever laid eyes on in their life . In history and this entire world . ”
8751	8786	8787	8787	Lia	1543	“ Excuse me . I may be biased , but I think the best - looking person in the world is my boyfriend , Lukas , but before you roll your eyes at me , ”
8798	8853	8854	8854	Lia	1543	“ I do know of someone in Lukas ’s social circle who you ’d find attractive . In fact , I ’ve told you about him before , but you were never interested in listening and he ’s also kind of a huge dick , so I figured it might be for the best , ”
8859	8892	8893	8893	she	1543	“ But anyway , if it ’s not a dating thing and all you ’re looking for is a really hot guy to finish the job that Elevator Babe started then Julian , ”
8902	8908	8893	8893	she	1543	“ could be the one . ”
8909	8920	8893	8893	she	1543	“ Right . I think you ’ve mentioned him before . ”
8921	8934	8893	8893	she	1543	“ I definitely have . Would you be interested in meeting him ? ”
8935	8939	8893	8893	she	1543	“ I guess . ”
8948	9052	8940	8940	Lia	1543	“ Oh my God , look , I know he might not end up as hot as your mysterious Elevator God , but I promise he ’s ten billion worlds better than Tinder Josh . In fact , I can say , despite being absurdly in love with Lukas , that Julian is objectively gorgeous . Like , really , really , almost annoyingly handsome – and mega rich , if you ’re into that . But anyway , I ’m gon na Google him and prove it to you right now so I can go ahead and say I told you so . ”
9053	9056	9057	9057	I	1543	“ Lia . ”
9068	9126	9127	9127	I	1543	“ It ’s fine , girl , I trust you . Tell you what , the next time you text me that you 're all hanging out , I ’ll actually join . I ’ve always wanted to , but I actually have the time now . In fact , I have way too much time now , ”
9145	9159	9160	9160	Lia	1543	“ Ah , ah . No wallowing , Sara . I forbid it , ”
9175	9226	9168	9168	she	1543	“ Hey , look at me . Do you wanna do something fun tonight ? You wanna see if there ’s a good chick flick at Alamo Drafthouse ? We can get drunk off margaritas and laugh at how people never say ‘ bye ’ on the phone in movies . ”
9227	9233	9168	9168	she	1543	“ That ’s an idea . ”
9234	9237	9238	9238	Lia	1543	“ Or . ”
9253	9271	9238	9238	Lia	1543	“ We could drink unlimited Veuve Cliquot for free at some billionaire fundraiser on the West Side . ”
9281	9289	9168	9168	she	1543	“ Those are two very different options . ”
9290	9320	9321	9321	She	1543	“ I know . But Lukas is at the fundraiser right now , and he says it ’s not black tie , so we can totally go . Also … ”
9351	9362	9344	9344	she	1543	“ Yes ! Julian ’s there . We ’re going ! ”
9363	9367	9368	9368	I	1543	“ Oh God , ”
9382	9398	9399	9399	Lia	1543	“ Do n’t ‘ oh God ’ me , you ’ll be thanking me soon , ”
9416	9446	9399	9399	Lia	1543	“ You and Julian , girl . It ’s happening . I mean he ’s kind of the worst , but he ’s probably at least decent in bed . ”
9447	9454	9455	9455	I	1543	“ Nice . You sold him , ”
9557	9561	9562	9562	I	1543	“ But why ? ”
9567	9571	9572	9572	Lia	1543	“ Silent auction ? ”
9590	9599	9600	9600	she	1543	“ There ’s Lukas talking to some people , ”
9633	9651	9628	9628	I	1543	“ I do n’t see Julian anywhere near him though . I wonder where that jerk is . ”
9652	9661	9693	9693	Ugh	101	“ Again , you ’re really selling him . ”
9662	9692	9693	9693	Ugh	101	“ Oh , hush . I could sing nothing but praise and you still would n’t care . You ’re just so … hung up on this elevator guy . ”
9881	9886	9887	9887	Lia	1543	“ Oh , oh ! ”
9890	9895	9887	9887	Lia	1543	“ I see Julian ! ”
9918	9931	9915	9915	she	1543	“ Which one is he ? The blonde guy in the blue ? ”
9932	9945	9896	9896	I	1543	“ Ugh , no , that guy is blocking him right now . ”
9946	9949	9950	9950	I	1543	“ Mm . ”
9962	9982	9983	9983	she	1543	“ Hey ! Act like you care ! Blue Suit ’s about to move so you can see Julian , ”
9987	10005	9983	9983	she	1543	“ There , there ! The one in the dark grey ! Quick , quick , look ! ”
10006	10011	10012	10012	I	1543	“ Okay , okay ! ”
10210	10214	10215	10215	he	87	“ That motherfucker ! ”
10235	10239	10229	10230	his brother	305	“ only real talent ”
10263	10266	10267	10267	Turner	319	“ Hey . ”
10271	10290	10267	10267	Turner	319	“ Let ’s go over there and outbid him in front of her . It ’ll be epic . ”
10297	10300	10291	10291	I	1543	“ No . ”
10301	10319	10267	10267	Turner	319	“ Oh , right , you ’re not impressed . You ’ve got plenty of those babies . ”
10394	10428	10429	10429	Turner	319	“ Hey – why do n’t we take one of your rides for a spin ? Maybe cruise around town and find some real talent since there ’s clearly none in this room , ”
10439	10442	10443	10443	he	319	“ Boring , ”
10446	10449	10450	10450	I	1543	“ Turner . ”
10455	10486	10487	10487	I	1543	“ I should remind you that I ’m trying to sell the Biarritz resort as soon as possible and you ’re by no means the only person interested in buying , ”
10646	10668	10669	10669	He	319	“ Hey . Anyone ever tell you to just relax , Hoult ? We ’re at a party . Enjoy yourself . ”
10675	10682	10669	10669	He	319	“ Tell you what , man . ”
10707	10758	10759	10759	He	319	“ Why do n’t we see what ’s going on at 1OAK tonight ? We ’ll grab Carter , take a spin in one of your cars , and we ’ll have a grand finale of balls to the wall partying before buckling down on Monday and really getting to – ”
10763	10766	10759	10759	He	319	“ Fuck . ”
10784	10787	10788	10788	I	1543	“ What ? ”
10793	10801	10802	10802	he	319	“ Who ’s that fuckin ’ beauty ? ”
10906	10914	10915	10915	I	1543	“ The hell is she doing here ? ”
10943	10954	10955	10955	She	384	“ What ? You know her ? Who is she ? ”
10992	11010	10972	10972	She	384	“ Jesus , Hoult . Hello ? Do n’t keep me hanging . I ’m dying here . ”
11047	11053	11054	11054	I	1543	“ She ’s my assistant , ”
11087	11104	11105	11105	Turner	319	“ Your assistant ? Why have n’t you brought her around ? Are you fucking crazy ? ”
11171	11174	11175	11175	I	1543	“ What ? ”
11180	11207	11175	11175	I	1543	“ Jesus – I asked why you ’ve never brought her around before . If she ’s your assistant , where the hell has she been ? ”
11214	11223	11224	11224	I	1543	“ She was away the past few weeks , ”
11239	11270	11232	11232	I	1543	“ She was overseeing the renovation and management change at the Biarritz resort . Her flight just got in tonight , so I was n’t expecting to see her here . ”
11289	11293	11294	11294	he	319	“ No shit , ”
11305	11313	11294	11294	he	319	“ Poor girl just wants to party . ”
11437	11446	11447	11447	he	319	“ Hoult , I owe you an apology , ”
11454	11479	11447	11447	he	319	“ I thought you were too straight - laced to hire smoking hot girls like her . Fuck did my dad call them again ? ”
11490	11495	11480	11480	He	319	“ Office - wreckers . ”
11496	11513	11545	11545	asshole	391	“ I hire based on capability , and I have a strict rule against interoffice dating . ”
11514	11519	11520	11520	Turner	319	“ You ’re crazy . ”
11525	11541	11520	11520	Turner	319	“ I mean Christ , do you see those tits ? Look at those tits . ”
11551	11576	11577	11577	I	1543	“ I have eyes . I know she ’s attractive . She ’s just far too valuable of an employee to risk anything with , ”
11580	11585	11586	11586	he	1543	“ Uh - huh , ”
11590	11616	11586	11586	he	1543	“ So you , uh … you said she ’s your expert on the Biarritz resort ? What ’s the name of the place again ? ”
11617	11621	11622	11622	My	1543	“ Hotel Piera . ”
11636	11667	11622	11622	My	1543	“ If you ’re interested in hearing her reports , I ’d be happy to have you at the office on Tuesday . That ’s her first official day back . ”
11668	11671	11672	11672	Turner	319	“ Yeah ? ”
11678	11694	11672	11672	Turner	319	“ Set it up , Hoult . Tuesday ’s good . Noon work for you ? ”
11695	11700	11701	11701	I	1543	“ Noon ’s perfect , ”
11811	11822	11800	11800	SARA	240	“ Do n’t look surprised . Just come with me . ”
11878	11884	11885	11885	I	1543	“ What ’s going on ? ”
11930	11933	11924	11924	they	398	“ Hey . ”
11984	11996	11997	11997	His	1543	“ Hey . Can you please tell me what ’s happening ? ”
12004	12014	12015	12015	he	1543	“ My colleague downstairs has his eye on you , ”
12058	12079	12052	12052	I	1543	“ And I need to brief you on a lie I involved you in before he tries to introduce himself . ”
12080	12091	12092	12092	He	1543	“ What the hell are you talking about , Julian ? ”
12131	12190	12052	12052	I	1543	“ You have Turner Roth ’s attention . I want his . For that reason , I ’d like to hire you for a very short and specific job . To be safe , we can make it a three - month contract , and I ’ll pay however much your last employer offered for a full year . ”
12191	12194	12092	12092	He	1543	“ What ? ”
12199	12214	12092	12092	He	1543	“ Wait . I do n’t understand – what kind of job is this ? ”
12215	12265	12266	12266	He	402	“ You ’d be posing as my assistant , and by Tuesday , I ’d need you to have memorized a full report on a twenty - million - dollar renovation to a resort in Biarritz , France that I ’m looking to sell to Turner and Carter Roth . ”
12275	12294	12266	12266	He	402	“ I ’ll also be needing you to present this information to them in a rather specific way . ”
12295	12300	12266	12266	He	402	“ How is that ? ”
12301	12308	12266	12266	He	402	“ I need you seduce them . ”
12312	12316	12309	12309	I	1543	“ Excuse me ? ”
12317	12331	12266	12266	He	402	“ By seduce , I do n’t at all mean sleep with them . ”
12332	12355	12356	12356	I	1543	“ Thank God for that , but then what do you mean ? Because I think I need a very thorough explanation , ”
12377	12394	12395	12395	he	402	“ I have a limited amount of time to strike an important deal with the Roths , ”
12408	12557	12395	12395	he	402	“ They just inherited the biggest sports and entertainment presenter in America , despite the fact that they ’re by no means actual or savvy businessmen . In fact , their particular egos make it so that they feel little reason to pay attention to anything unless it involves instant gratification , generally in the form of impressing a beautiful woman . Of course , from what I ’ve gathered , they lose that interest the moment they actually have sex with the woman , so your job is to be professional while also dressing provocatively and flirting enough to maintain their interest . All I need is for them to listen long enough to connect me with their business advisors , with whom I ’ll actually have productive meetings . So realistically , the hardest part of your job could be done within just a few meetings . ”
12594	12636	12589	12589	I	1543	“ Okay , so … correct me if I ’m wrong , but you ’re saying you want me to string these guys along with my sexual allure , and force them to pay attention to your pitch in the process ? ”
12637	12706	12589	12589	I	1543	“ Yes . But you ’ll never spend any time alone with them . You ’ll only ever be accompanying me during meetings and business trips , and when we ’re not doing anything involving the Roths , which will probably be most days of your week , you ’re free to use the resources at my office to send resumes , or work on your own projects . ”
12728	12734	12735	12735	Julian	1543	“ What are you thinking ? ”
12738	12744	12745	12745	I	1543	“ That this is crazy , ”
12834	12843	12844	12844	Julian	1543	“ Tell me about the job you quit , ”
12854	12859	12844	12844	Julian	1543	“ Where was it ? ”
12860	12864	12844	12844	Julian	1543	“ June Magazine . ”
12868	12873	12865	12865	He	1543	“ You ’re kidding . ”
12880	12887	12874	12874	I	1543	“ I ’m not . Why ? ”
12888	12892	12893	12893	he	1543	“ No reason , ”
12906	12940	12893	12893	he	1543	“ But if I told you that I could guarantee getting you either your job back or a better one after our contract is finished , would you agree to work for me ? ”
13125	13128	13129	13129	I	1543	“ Okay , ”
13166	13172	13159	13159	he	1543	“ We have a deal ? ”
13202	13205	13206	13206	I	1543	“ Yes . ”
13215	13221	13206	13206	I	1543	“ We have a deal . ”
13230	13245	13222	13222	I	1543	“ And in case you were at all interested , my name is Sara . ”
13251	13254	13255	13255	Julian	1543	“ Sara , ”
13283	13295	13296	13296	he	1543	“ It was nice to meet you last week , Sara , ”
13306	13315	13296	13296	he	1543	“ I look forward to working with you . ”
13316	13319	13320	13320	I	1543	“ Likewise , ”
13600	13611	13612	13612	Lia	1543	“ I maintain that I told you about him before , ”
13661	13664	13665	13665	I	1543	“ Disagree . ”
13717	13730	13708	13708	you	416	“ I swear , you did n’t tell me shit , woman . ”
13731	13735	13736	13736	Lia	1543	“ Oh no , ”
13742	13751	13736	13736	Lia	1543	“ Did I just chip my favorite mug ? ”
13763	13798	13757	13757	she	1543	“ Oh , thank God , I did n’t . You know what I did do though ? Tell you about Julian . A long time ago . On three or four separate occasions . ”
13817	13848	13849	13849	I	1543	“ Well , if you did , you did n’t harass me hard enough to listen . Or offer the juicy details , like how he owns Hoult Freaking Publishing , ”
13918	13934	13963	13963	her	417	“ Whatever . Stop Googling pictures of him . I can hear you furiously clicking . ”
13935	13941	13942	13942	I	1543	“ Hoult Publishing , Lia , ”
13945	13954	13942	13942	I	1543	“ I ’ll never forgive you for this . ”
13955	13960	13963	13963	her	417	“ Yeah , yeah . ”
13974	14015	13963	13963	her	417	“ To be fair , I have no idea what Hoult Publishing is . When I first met Julian , everyone was talking about how he just bought a baseball team , so I thought that was what he did . ”
14016	14040	13942	13942	I	1543	“ Yeah , that ’s also fucking crazy . The fact that he owns the Empires ? They ’re killing it this season . ”
14041	14060	13963	13963	her	417	“ Whatever . Is baseball brown ball or white ball ? And are you leaving for work yet ? ”
14061	14072	13942	13942	I	1543	“ Almost . I just need to finish getting dressed . ”
14073	14088	14089	14089	Lia	1543	“ Is n’t the point of your dirty little job to not be dressed ? ”
14092	14132	13942	13942	I	1543	“ Only on days that I ’m meeting with the Perv Brothers , and even then , I do have to keep it tasteful . I ca n’t just waltz into the conference room wearing a thong and fishnets . ”
14136	14149	14133	14133	Lia	1543	“ Of course not . You ’d need sequined nipple tassels too . ”
14150	14181	14182	14182	I	1543	“ I would never wear sequins to work , Lia . You know I would keep it classy – pinstriped nipple tassels , only . Maybe khaki ones on Fridays , ”
14192	14216	14217	14217	I	1543	“ In all seriousness though , I do need to maintain some air of professionalism … which probably also requires being on time , ”
14261	14269	14256	14256	Lia	1543	“ Time check is eight - fifteen . ”
14270	14275	14276	14276	My	1543	“ Shit , really ? ”
14293	14309	14276	14276	My	1543	“ God , I refuse to be late . On the first day or any . ”
14310	14336	14337	14337	Lia	1543	“ Breathe , girl . You wo n’t be late if you leave right now . Just check for panty lines on the way out , ”
14351	14355	14276	14276	My	1543	“ All good . ”
14356	14360	14337	14337	Lia	1543	“ Buttons straight ? ”
14387	14396	14397	14397	I	1543	“ Oh God . This bra is killer , ”
14421	14429	14397	14397	I	1543	“ Tell me you wore The One . ”
14430	14434	14397	14397	I	1543	“ I did . ”
14486	14533	14617	14617	she	1543	“ He ’s gon na get one look of the girls in that thing and go nuts . I hope you ’re prepared for some hot , sweaty , bent - over - the - desk office sex . You realize that ’s happening , right ? ”
14534	14549	14550	14550	I	1543	“ As much as I would n’t mind it , I ’m not sure , ”
14566	14575	14576	14576	Lia	1543	“ What ? Why are n’t you sure ? ”
14580	14616	14617	14617	she	1543	“ That man is definitely dying to get a moment alone with you already . First it was that barge - in at the hotel , then it was hiding you from that guy yesterday , ”
14652	14665	14644	14644	I	1543	“ Trust me , girl . That man is waiting to pounce . ”
14666	14756	14617	14617	she	1543	“ We ’ll see . Judging from yesterday , Julian Hoult is a very different beast when he ’s in work mode . He ’s in a different world completely . He ’s intense , and he ’s focused , and actually , it ’s insanely fucking hot and I ’m really not sure how I ’m going to handle it . But anyway , I ’m almost at the train so I ’m gon na lose service . I ’ll call you at the end of the day . ”
14757	14783	14644	14644	I	1543	“ No , you ’ll text me live updates as your day goes on , except for when you ’re actively having sex with Julian . ”
14784	14794	14617	14617	she	1543	“ Ha . I ’ll talk to you later . ”
14795	14800	14801	14801	Lia	1543	“ Later , girl , ”
14804	14815	14801	14801	Lia	1543	“ Enjoy your first day as a professional sex kitten . ”
15030	15035	15036	15036	he	1505	“ Who ’s that ? ”
15287	15294	15276	15276	everyone	210	“ Good morning , Mr. Hoult . ”
15376	15382	15390	15390	He	1543	“ Good morning , sir . ”
15383	15389	15390	15390	He	1543	“ Morning , Mr. Hoult . ”
15430	15434	15435	15435	I	1543	“ Mr. Hoult , ”
15438	15442	15435	15435	I	1543	“ Ms. Hanna . ”
15487	15494	15495	15495	he	1543	“ How are you this morning ? ”
15499	15506	15507	15507	I	1543	“ Very well , thank you , ”
15552	15566	15567	15567	I	1543	“ I did start a little nervous , but I ’m better now , ”
15636	15641	15627	15627	he	1543	“ How are you ? ”
15648	15657	15642	15642	His	1543	“ Better now as well . Thank you . ”
15757	15761	15762	15762	he	447	“ Get ready , ”
15857	15861	15862	15862	Julian	1543	“ Ms. Hanna . ”
15879	15885	15886	15886	he	447	“ Little forward of you , ”
15892	15895	15896	15896	I	1543	“ Sorry , ”
15910	15925	15896	15896	I	1543	“ Do n’t be sorry , just do n’t make that face right now . ”
15926	15930	15886	15886	he	447	“ What face ? ”
15931	15946	15896	15896	I	1543	“ The one you made right before you put my cock in your mouth . ”
15977	15985	15986	15986	Julian	1543	“ Now you ’re just teasing me , ”
16017	16022	16023	16023	I	1543	“ Risky of you , ”
16027	16039	16040	16040	Julian	1543	“ You bring it out of me , but I agree , ”
16043	16048	16040	16040	Julian	1543	“ Let ’s behave . ”
16208	16218	16222	16222	his	1543	“ I should fuck you right in this elevator . ”
16244	16249	16222	16222	his	1543	“ You ca n’t . ”
16250	16254	16222	16222	his	1543	“ Why not ? ”
16255	16263	16264	16264	I	1543	“ We do n’t have enough time , ”
16274	16289	16290	16290	he	1543	“ Is the lack of time your only qualm about getting fucked in here ? ”
16313	16316	16317	16317	I	1543	“ Yes , ”
16321	16328	16317	16317	I	1543	“ That ’s the only reason . ”
16345	16356	16357	16357	he	1543	“ Then let ’s do what we have time for , ”
16391	16394	16395	16395	I	1543	“ Julian ! ”
16410	16415	16398	16398	he	1543	“ Oh my God . ”
16515	16518	16519	16519	he	1543	“ Ready ? ”
16717	16772	16773	16773	Colin	95	“ She ’s pretty much memorized on general information – facts about the building , architecture , Basque Country itself . She ’s going to take information home to keep studying , but the past hour , she ’s been looking at the quarterlies . Just so she can start getting acquainted with sales , ”
16847	16855	16927	16927	she	240	“ So she ’s right on schedule . ”
16856	16876	16927	16927	she	240	“ Ahead , if anything . Like you said , the Roths are unlikely to ask about numbers tomorrow . ”
16877	16903	16927	16927	she	240	“ Yes , and she knows the short - term goal here is to get the Roths to agree on a trip out to Biarritz ? ”
16904	16907	16908	16908	Colin	95	“ Yes , ”
16911	16925	16908	16908	Colin	95	“ She ’s confident she can influence them . She ’s very eager . ”
17024	17028	17017	17017	Lukas	355	“ similar workaholic tendencies ”
17286	17300	17301	17301	Colin	95	“ So if we ’re all set , I can send her home ? ”
17322	17336	17301	17301	Colin	95	“ Yes . But have her stop in here on her way out . ”
17337	17342	17311	17311	I	1543	“ You got it . ”
17343	17347	17348	17348	I	1543	“ Thank you , ”
17459	17467	17468	17468	I	1543	“ Come in . Have a seat . ”
17478	17485	17468	17468	I	1543	“ How was your first day ? ”
17486	17493	17494	17494	Sara	240	“ Good . I enjoyed myself , ”
17531	17553	17494	17494	Sara	240	“ Colin said you did a great job . Do you feel comfortable with the material you went over with him ? ”
17554	17561	17562	17562	She	240	“ Absolutely . That resort is … ”
17568	17593	17562	17562	She	240	“ So beautiful , Julian . I can hardly believe you want to sell it when you had it built from the ground up . ”
17653	17662	17679	17679	She	240	“ Do you have any questions thus far ? ”
17663	17674	17679	17679	She	240	“ About the resort ? Or my day in general ? ”
17675	17678	17679	17679	She	240	“ Either . ”
17698	17752	17679	17679	She	240	“ Well , I was wondering … obviously , Colin knows a few details about my contract since he ’s been training me on the resort information . But what does the rest of your office know about my role in this company ? Do they know … what I was hired for ? ”
17753	17793	17679	17679	She	240	“ Absolutely not . As far as the office is concerned , you ’re training to be a third assistant . They wo n’t at any point learn about the specifics of your contract . It ’s sensitive information . ”
17794	17800	17801	17801	she	240	“ Okay , thank God , ”
17804	17841	17801	17801	she	240	“ I just would n’t want my role here to be misconstrued , considering how it ’s kind of … risqué in nature . I obviously trust you with the information , but not anyone else . ”
17842	17877	17679	17679	She	240	“ Understood entirely . No one in this office or building will know about your contract . I have no intention of putting you in a position where you could be viewed differently here . ”
17878	17883	17884	17884	Sara	240	“ I appreciate it , ”
17897	17914	17884	17884	Sara	240	“ I take it then that what happens in the elevator before work is an exception . ”
17915	17928	17679	17679	She	240	“ Actually , I called you in here to touch upon that . ”
17929	17932	17933	17933	She	240	“ Oh ? ”
17938	17948	17933	17933	She	240	“ What exactly would you like to touch upon ? ”
17991	18044	18045	18045	I	1543	“ I wanted to talk to you about a rule I ’ve enforced at this company for as long as it ’s been around . It applies to everyone , myself included , and it ’s been crucial for us in terms of running business in a seamless , strictly professional way , ”
18095	18159	18160	18160	Sara	240	“ In short , I have a zero tolerance rule on interoffice dating . Romances , sexual relations of any kind – they ’re all off the table , and I felt the need to tell you that despite your unique contract , and despite what happened between us before work this morning , I ca n’t allow any exceptions to that rule . ”
18166	18177	18178	18178	she	240	“ So , what happened this morning did n’t count ? ”
18182	18194	18178	18178	she	240	“ Simply because I had n’t officially started the job yet ? ”
18195	18257	18258	18258	I	1543	“ I did n’t come in this morning with the intention of taking advantage of some loophole . I had n’t actually thought about it . My intention was to be professional with you from the start . Of course , I did n’t exactly control myself as I should have this morning , and I take full responsibility for that , ”
18261	18285	18258	18258	I	1543	“ But moving forward , I hope we can start anew and give your contract with this company the full respect it deserves . ”
18320	18323	18315	18315	Sara	240	“ Okay . ”
18341	18347	18348	18348	I	1543	“ I appreciate your understanding , ”
18376	18399	18400	18400	she	240	“ Of course . You might not know this , but if anyone were to understand work rules , it ’s me , ”
18403	18419	18420	18420	I	1543	“ Then that ’s a relief to hear . And thank you again for understanding , ”
18432	18438	18420	18420	I	1543	“ I do appreciate it . ”
18439	18451	18452	18452	she	240	“ Well , I appreciate the opportunity just to work here , ”
18456	18491	18452	18452	she	240	“ It ’s crazy how much I ’ve picked up from your staff in one day . I ’m pretty sure I ’ll learn quite a few things in just a few months here . ”
18492	18499	18523	18524	Mr. Hoult	95	“ I hope that you do . ”
18508	18522	18505	18505	she	240	“ Is that all you wanted to discuss with me , Mr. Hoult ? ”
18541	18544	18545	18545	I	1543	“ Yes , ”
18548	18562	18545	18545	I	1543	“ That ’s all . You ’re free to leave for the day . ”
18563	18572	18573	18573	she	240	“ Great . Thank you again for everything , ”
18580	18593	18573	18573	she	240	“ And have a good night . I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
18594	18598	18599	18599	I	1543	“ You too , ”
18673	18689	18690	18690	Lia	1543	“ I ’m so sorry , Sara . I feel like it ’s my fault , ”
18912	18914	18909	18909	I	1543	“ yes ”
18947	18969	19148	19148	God	1543	“ It ’s my fault , Lia , trust me . You did n’t tell me to take this job offer . ”
18970	18984	19148	19148	God	1543	“ Yeah , but I did try to set you up with Julian . ”
18985	19021	19148	19148	God	1543	“ And it might ’ve worked if I did n’t decide to become his subordinate . Now he ’s probably already ceased all sexual attraction for me like the work - addicted robot he is . ”
19022	19047	19148	19148	God	1543	“ Psh , right . Lukas said he ’s never seen Julian look at a girl with the intensity that he looked at you . ”
19048	19061	19062	19062	I	1543	“ Yeah , because I ’m an element of his job now , ”
19065	19108	19062	19062	I	1543	“ He salivates over me because he ca n’t wait to utilize me for the purposes of this stupid contract with the Perv Bros. I ’m as good as a stapler to him now . Or an extra - sturdy paper clip . ”
19109	19147	19152	19152	he	1543	“ Oh , shut it . You know that despite that stupid rule of his , he definitely still has sexual thoughts about you . I mean he admitted as much in the elevator yesterday , right ? ”
19274	19279	19256	19256	he	88	“ Earth to Sara . ”
19316	19327	19299	19299	she	487	“ Thanks . I needed to snap out of that . ”
19328	19347	19299	19299	she	487	“ Yeah , that was uncomfortable for me . You looked like you were seconds from the big O. ”
19348	19409	19299	19299	she	487	“ Shut up . And cut me some slack . I ’m dealing with an absurdly hot boss who ’s done everything but fuck me , and now that we work in the same office , I get nothing . I also have no idea how to un - turn myself on when I so much as think of him . ”
19410	19422	19423	19423	Lia	1543	“ Let me help . Your mom ’s calling . Again . ”
19440	19484	19299	19299	she	487	“ I ca n’t right now . I suck at lying to her and I ’m pretty sure she ’s calling because she has a sixth sense when it comes to me . She definitely knows I did a bad thing this week . ”
19485	19490	19491	19491	Lia	1543	“ A bad thing ? ”
19494	19515	19491	19491	Lia	1543	“ Which of your many bad things are you referring to ? You ’re like a different person this week . ”
19516	19546	19434	19434	she	1543	“ Hey , do n’t you talk to me about abrupt transformations – you went from celibate for three years to having sex with Lukas in a public bathroom . ”
19547	19550	19551	19551	Lia	1543	“ Sara ! ”
19567	19588	19589	19589	she	1543	“ Oh God . You need to get out of here or I ’m never going to finish this batch , ”
19592	19608	19589	19589	she	1543	“ And do n’t you have your super important meeting with the Perv Bros today ? ”
19609	19635	19589	19589	she	1543	“ Yes . But I can be a little late . I have to pick up lunch for the meeting from some restaurant in SoHo . ”
19636	19643	19644	19644	Lia	1543	“ And you ’re wearing that ? ”
19652	19655	19656	19656	I	1543	“ Totally , ”
19714	19724	19738	19738	Lia	1543	“ I brought a change of clothes , obviously . ”
19725	19737	19738	19738	Lia	1543	“ Okay , phew . Then get your cute butt going , ”
19747	19782	19738	19738	Lia	1543	“ And girl , you better kill it ‘ cause I ’m pissed at Julian on your behalf and I want you to torture him with how hard you bring it for this meeting . ”
19783	19805	19738	19738	Lia	1543	“ Trust me , I ’m well prepared , and I have every intention of making it hurt for him today . ”
19806	19818	19819	19819	Lia	1543	“ Atta girl . Is that what that thing is about ? ”
19834	19839	19840	19840	I	1543	“ Mm - hm , ”
19884	19888	19831	19831	her	1543	“ I could never ”
20216	20220	20198	20198	they	92	“ the assistant . ”
20221	20230	20231	20231	Turner	319	“ Sara . She looks like a Sara , ”
20239	20247	20248	20248	Carter	87	“ What does a Sara look like ? ”
20251	20260	20248	20248	Carter	87	“ Brunette . Long legs . Great tits . ”
20261	20264	20265	20265	I	1543	“ Gentlemen . ”
20331	20339	20340	20340	Turner	319	“ Jesus Christ . She seems fun , ”
20352	20368	20340	20340	Turner	319	“ My question is who thought it was a good idea to knock her up ? ”
20369	20379	20380	20380	Carter	87	“ I want to buy that guy a beer , ”
20383	20395	20396	20396	Turner	319	“ Fuck a beer . Double Scotch is what he needs , ”
20399	20422	20396	20396	Turner	319	“ See , that ’s the thing about hiring women . You got ta hire them pretty to make it worth it . ”
20434	20444	20423	20423	I	1543	“ Do n’t talk about my employees like that . ”
20445	20458	20459	20459	Turner	319	“ Oh … Je - sus . Mr. No Fun right here , ”
20677	20679	20662	20662	I	1543	“ Delivered ”
20770	20776	20777	20777	she	240	“ Thank you so much ! ”
20789	20813	20814	20814	he	319	“ You ’re very welcome . Sara , right ? I ca n’t believe Julian ’s got you carrying heavy bags like this , ”
20828	20838	20839	20839	she	240	“ Oh , he knows I can take it , ”
20934	20943	20944	20944	I	1543	“ Gentlemen , why do n’t we sit ? ”
21074	21077	21078	21078	Sara	240	“ So , ”
21082	21131	21132	21132	she	240	“ I ’m excited to finally meet you gentlemen . Julian told me while I was out in Biarritz that there were a lot of people interested in the property and it made me so happy . And , well , a little sad at the same time , ”
21143	21152	21139	21139	Turner	319	“ Happy and sad ? Why ’s that ? ”
21153	21158	21159	21159	Sara	240	“ Oh , well , ”
21168	21217	21159	21159	Sara	240	“ I think Julian hates when I say this , but that resort is to die for . It ’s so elegant , so beautifully designed . Every detail is deliberately thought out to ensure the most relaxing time ever – I barely felt like I was working . ”
21218	21221	21222	21222	Turner	319	“ Wow , ”
21262	21268	21269	21269	Turner	319	“ That true , Hoult ? ”
21282	21324	21269	21269	Turner	319	“ I do hate when she says that . It ’s not like I wo n’t miss the place once it ’s gone . I ’m just moving away from hospitality , and the resort does n’t suit my direction anymore . ”
21325	21337	21338	21338	Sara	240	“ But it more than suits yours , right , gentlemen ? ”
21347	21366	21338	21338	Sara	240	“ I understand you guys were pro surfers – which , by the way , is really amazing . ”
21371	21382	21367	21367	Turner	319	“ I was pro . Carter was semi - pro . ”
21383	21388	21389	21389	Carter	87	“ I was pro , ”
21392	21399	21400	21400	Sara	240	“ You were both pro then , ”
21409	21423	21400	21400	Sara	240	“ And I understand you ’re in the market for the resort because … ”
21474	21488	21489	21489	Sara	240	“ You ’re looking to bring a … luxury surfing competition to Biarritz ? ”
21497	21500	21489	21489	Sara	240	“ Wow . ”
21506	21512	21501	21501	She	240	“ That ’s so interesting . ”
21604	21606	21633	21633	she	240	“ wow ”
21608	21610	21612	21612	he	319	“ absolutely ”
21639	21666	21667	21667	Sara	240	“ And Carter – I ’m so lost . Could you help me with the logistics of bringing a brand new surfing event to this town ? ”
21677	21685	21667	21667	Sara	240	“ How long would that even take ? ”
21738	21741	21742	21742	Sara	240	“ Wow , ”
21749	21762	21742	21742	Sara	240	“ So you ’ll be needing this property sooner than I thought . ”
21800	21814	21815	21815	he	319	“ Damn , I guess so . We got ta get shit moving , ”
21889	21904	21905	21905	she	240	“ You guys can teach me how to surf like I ’ve always wanted , ”
21908	21931	21905	21905	she	240	“ And , of course , we can have you check out the property firsthand so you can really gauge your interest . ”
21932	21953	22008	22008	them	516	“ Oh , I ’ll teach you to surf . I ’ll have you rippin ’ waves like The Duke . ”
21954	21980	21981	21981	Sara	240	“ I have no idea who that is , but I look forward to getting a full - on surf education from you , Turner , ”
21984	22000	22008	22008	them	516	“ You will , you will . We ’ll have to set a date soon . ”
22323	22332	22333	22333	I	1543	“ Gentlemen . We ’ll touch base soon , ”
22356	22389	22390	22390	Turner	319	“ Yeah , yeah , well , why do n’t we shoot for sometime next week ? I ’m booked through the weekend , but how about we link up again Monday ? ”
22413	22418	22419	22419	I	1543	“ Monday it is , ”
22453	22463	22464	22464	she	240	“ You did n’t think I could do it , ”
22483	22487	22464	22464	she	240	“ Excuse me ? ”
22488	22504	22505	22505	she	240	“ You texted me before the meeting started . ‘ Possible change of plans ? ’ ”
22536	22577	22505	22505	she	240	“ I was n’t doubting your ability so much as trying to give you an out . The Roths were being particularly intolerable before you arrived , and it gave me certain ideas of how they ’d behave around you . ”
22578	22584	22637	22637	sir	95	“ Certain ideas ? Like ? ”
22595	22616	22585	22585	I	1543	“ Like using certain language and putting their hands all over you in ways I did n’t care to see . ”
22617	22631	22637	22637	sir	95	“ I thought you ’d hired me for that specific reason , sir . ”
22639	22651	22652	22652	I	1543	“ I did . Today , I entertained second - thoughts , ”
22656	22668	22669	22669	Sara	240	“ I did n’t pin you for someone who had those , ”
22684	22699	22669	22669	Sara	240	“ Well , I imagine there ’s a first time for everything , Sara . ”
22700	22723	22724	22724	she	240	“ Fine . But if it happened because you feel in some way protective or doubtful of me , you can relax , ”
22748	22797	22735	22735	My	1543	“ As far as I can tell , you have full confidence in Colin and Tori and every other employee of yours in this office . So if I ’m just another one of them , sir , you can feel free to let me do my job . ”
22798	22808	22809	22809	I	1543	“ There ’s a unique nature to your contract , ”
22838	22887	22888	22888	she	240	“ Yes , there ’s a unique nature to my contract , but if all the same rules apply to me , then what I simply ask is that you respect me in the same way you do everyone else . Anything short of that is completely hypocritical , ”
22909	22923	22902	22902	she	240	“ Anyway , may I go on my lunch break now , sir ? ”
22924	22931	22932	22932	I	1543	“ Why are you doing that ? ”
22940	22944	22935	22935	She	240	“ Doing what ? ”
22945	22960	22902	22902	she	240	“ The way you ’re calling me ‘ sir . ’ It ’s odd . ”
22961	22977	22935	22935	She	240	“ I ’m just trying to be as professional as you want me to be . ”
22997	23010	22902	22902	she	240	“ I believe the term you ’re looking for is passive aggressive . ”
23014	23023	23011	23011	Sara	240	“ What would you prefer I call you ? ”
23024	23027	22988	22988	she	240	“ Julian . ”
23028	23045	23046	23046	she	240	“ Alright , Julian . Is it alright if I go on my lunch break now ? ”
23088	23095	23065	23065	her	240	“ You may go to lunch . ”
23096	23102	23082	23082	I	1543	“ Thank you , Julian . ”
23103	23110	23111	23111	I	1543	“ You ’re welcome , Sara , ”
23418	23420	23401	23401	He	88	“ morning ”
23572	23584	23585	23585	she	1543	“ I do n’t think you ’re bringing it hard enough , ”
23605	23620	23585	23585	she	1543	“ This could be a double date right now , but it ’s not . ”
23829	23834	23835	23835	I	1543	“ Sorry , love . ”
23844	23856	23835	23835	I	1543	“ Pretty sure the boss and I are at a standstill . ”
23857	23868	23869	23869	Lia	1543	“ I should have known you two were too similar , ”
23874	23902	23869	23869	Lia	1543	“ You and Julian having sex would probably be nonstop rolling over to fight for the top . You would need wrestling mats and an entire gym . ”
23909	23921	23903	23903	I	1543	“ Please keep in mind the man works in this building . ”
23922	23933	23835	23835	I	1543	“ He owns the building . What do I care ? ”
23934	23950	23903	23903	I	1543	“ Yeah , also , please do n’t remind me that he owns the building . ”
23951	23955	23956	23956	Lia	1543	“ Why not ? ”
23966	23974	23956	23956	Lia	1543	“ Because his power turns you on ? ”
23975	24003	23903	23903	I	1543	“ Yes , very much so , actually . And right now , I ’m trying to manage my arousal for the sake of maintaining utmost professionalism . ”
24004	24016	23956	23956	Lia	1543	“ Right . How ’s that going , by the way ? ”
24017	24024	23903	23903	I	1543	“ Swimmingly . Hence the standstill . ”
24025	24043	23956	23956	Lia	1543	“ So you ’ve officially mastered the casual - despite - my - wet - panties look ? ”
24044	24055	23903	23903	I	1543	“ You ’ll be proud to know that I have . ”
24066	24086	24056	24056	Lia	1543	“ Well , that ’s good because here comes my boyfriend and your boss looking like an Armani billboard . ”
24143	24148	24149	24149	Lia	1543	“ Hey , Julian , ”
24180	24183	24185	24185	her	1543	“ Hello . ”
24193	24196	24185	24185	her	1543	“ Sara . ”
24197	24201	24172	24172	she	1543	“ Mr. Hoult . ”
24202	24207	24208	24208	Lia	1543	“ Oh , God , ”
24211	24221	24222	24222	she	1543	“ Do you really make her call you that ? ”
24246	24253	24254	24254	He	88	“ I do n’t , actually . ”
24261	24271	24254	24254	He	88	“ I remember telling you as much , Sara . ”
24272	24281	24254	24254	He	88	“ My apologies . I must have forgotten . ”
24282	24290	24291	24291	Lia	1543	“ Oh no . Couple ’s quarrel ? ”
24300	24303	24304	24304	She	1543	“ What ? ”
24308	24326	24304	24304	She	1543	“ I can tell you guys what Lukas and I do to fix things after we fight . ”
24327	24330	24331	24331	I	1543	“ Lia , ”
24353	24379	24404	24404	ME	1543	“ Seriously . You all know I ignored this advice for too long myself , but sometimes you just got ta bang it out and – ”
24380	24387	24388	24388	I	1543	“ I ’m getting a coffee , ”
24510	24520	24497	24499	the young barista	552	“ I should have considered Lia before hiring you . ”
24550	24555	24497	24499	the young barista	552	“ What about her ? ”
24556	24567	24568	24568	Julian	88	“ She ’s here enough as it is for Lukas , ”
24586	24610	24568	24568	Julian	88	“ But aside from that , I ’d prefer you two refrain from discussing whatever it was that you clearly were just now . ”
24621	24654	24497	24499	the young barista	552	“ I would think this was obvious , but forbidding certain topics of conversation with my friends is way outside the realm of what you ’re allowed to do as my boss . ”
24655	24662	24663	24663	he	88	“ I ’m aware of that , ”
24667	24723	24663	24663	he	88	“ What I ’m asking is for you to not discuss anything sexual that happened between us while you ’re on work premises . I ’m sure you ’ve noticed , but this large building is a rather small community . People talk , and I have no interest in giving them anything to discuss . ”
24724	24735	24736	24736	I	1543	“ Fair enough . I apologize on Lia ’s behalf , ”
24740	24748	24736	24736	I	1543	“ She ’s not usually like this . ”
24749	24765	24497	24499	the young barista	552	“ I know her as well , Sara , and she ’s always like this . ”
24766	24782	24783	24783	I	1543	“ You ’ve only known her for as long as she ’s been dating Lukas , ”
24786	24832	24783	24783	I	1543	“ And it ’s only because of him that she ’s gotten this carefree and outspoken , which , in her defense , is not a bad thing . I guess it ’s just what happens when you ’re in a happy and fulfilling relationship . ”
24833	24837	24838	24838	Julian	88	“ You guess ? ”
24846	24854	24838	24838	Julian	88	“ Yes . I can only guess . ”
24855	24860	24861	24861	Julian	88	“ That ’s right . ”
24884	24896	24897	24897	he	88	“ Fulfilling was the opposite of the last relationship you had , ”
24909	24920	24897	24897	he	88	“ See you back at the office , Ms. Hanna . ”
25086	25097	25098	25098	Colin	95	“ Sure you do n’t want to come with us ? ”
25111	25120	25098	25098	Colin	95	“ Is it because of the pineapple shorts ? ”
25127	25139	25098	25098	Colin	95	“ Oh God , it ’s because of the pineapple shorts . ”
25140	25150	25151	25151	I	1543	“ It ’s not because of the pineapple shorts , ”
25310	25312	25301	25301	LIA	1543	“ reasonably ”
25375	25380	25359	25359	I	1543	“ Jesus , Lia , ”
25394	25405	25406	25406	She	559	“ reasonably sexy summer clothes , but nothing too crazy . ”
25473	25476	25477	25477	he	95	“ Whoa , ”
25538	25545	25546	25546	he	95	“ You look … very wow , ”
25576	25588	25589	25589	he	95	“ Oh Christ , he ’s gon na fire me now , ”
25660	25666	25651	25651	his	88	“ Sara . A word . ”
25697	25708	25691	25691	he	95	“ I need you to change out of that first . ”
25712	25716	25709	25709	I	1543	“ Excuse me ? ”
25717	25732	25733	25733	Julian	88	“ That ’s not workplace appropriate . Put on what you were wearing before , ”
25873	25879	25880	25880	I	1543	“ Was that really necessary ? ”
25894	25903	25904	25904	he	88	“ You ca n’t dress like that here , ”
25920	25931	25904	25904	he	88	“ Everyone changed after work today . Not just me . ”
25932	25950	25951	25951	Julian	88	“ Everyone changed into something casual , like a summer dress , or a polo and shorts . ”
25962	25978	25951	25951	Julian	88	“ Denim panties were n’t what I had in mind when I sent that memo . ”
25979	25985	25986	25986	I	1543	“ Well , I apologize , ”
25997	26041	25986	25986	I	1543	“ But I do feel the need to point out that several other women in this office left in dresses that were the same length as my shorts , with no sleeves , and you did n’t call them in to reprimand them . ”
26042	26051	26052	26052	he	88	“ You ’re right . I did n’t , ”
26123	26136	26137	26137	Julian	88	“ So , I do n’t get an explanation for that inconsistency ? ”
26151	26154	26155	26155	he	88	“ No , ”
26165	26192	26193	26193	I	1543	“ That hardly seems fair , and again , I ca n’t help but suspect you ’re treating me differently than the rest of the office , ”
26197	26259	26193	26193	I	1543	“ Actually , you are treating me differently than the rest of the office . The fact of the matter is , I know why you ’re singling me out . We both do . And for you to use that as a reason to make my life difficult today is completely unfair given your problem is something you alone created . ”
26292	26303	26283	26283	I	1543	“ if you want to fuck me , then fuck me ”
26317	26331	26332	26332	he	88	“ And for what reason do you think I ’m singling you out ? ”
26335	26352	26283	26283	I	1543	“ Can I say it or do I need to use your beloved corporate - speak ? ”
26353	26358	26283	26283	I	1543	“ Just say it . ”
26359	26369	26370	26370	I	1543	“ Because you want to fuck me , Julian , ”
26374	26407	26408	26408	I	1543	“ You want to fuck me , you wo n’t let yourself fuck me , so you ’re taking it out on me – since that makes so much sense , right ? ”
26419	26470	26408	26408	I	1543	“ Right . Well , if you have nothing left to say , then I ’m going to go . I have to find some Starbucks to change in now , and I ’m pretty sure I ’ll be late to meet the guys for happy hour , so bye . ”
26471	26477	26530	26530	I	1543	“ Who are you meeting ? ”
26506	26513	26514	26514	I	1543	“ Guys from Kinsley - Weiss , ”
26544	26550	26530	26530	I	1543	“ Just you and them ? ”
26551	26557	26530	26530	I	1543	“ Just me and them . ”
26558	26569	26530	26530	I	1543	“ I thought you were going to drinks with Colin . ”
26578	26620	26570	26570	I	1543	“ I decided against it . He works in my office , so it ’s probably safer to have drinks with men I do n’t run the risk of losing my job with should I choose to go home with them . ”
26647	26658	26627	26627	He	88	“ So your plan is to sleep with someone tonight . ”
26659	26672	26673	26673	I	1543	“ That ’s none of your business , and I ’m leaving , ”
26710	26733	26734	26734	I	1543	“ It ’s every bit my business when you ’re going with people I know , and in particular do n’t trust . ”
26740	26813	26814	26814	I	1543	“ You strike me as someone who does n’t trust , period , and we ’ve already established the parameters of your authority over me , Julian . Yes , you can tell me what I can and can not wear , but no , you do n’t get to decide where I go after work or who I want to fuck , especially when I ’m the one waiting for you , ”
26817	26841	26814	26814	I	1543	“ You ’re the one with the rule , so either make a move , asshole , or get out of my way . ”
26874	26881	26882	26882	he	1543	“ Take a seat , Sara , ”
26885	26892	26859	26859	his	1543	“ Julian , I told you – ”
26893	26902	26912	26912	my	1543	“ Unbutton your shirt before you sit down . ”
26930	26941	26942	26942	I	1543	“ What exactly are you asking of me right now ? ”
26945	26974	26942	26942	I	1543	“ I ’m asking you to take a seat in front of my desk , Sara . And I want you to take your shirt off for me . ”
27047	27050	27051	27051	he	88	“ Unbutton , ”
27073	27076	27069	27069	he	88	“ Slowly . ”
27080	27088	27077	27077	I	1543	“ Are you going to fuck me ? ”
27089	27116	27077	27077	I	1543	“ I do n’t enjoy contradicting myself . If you ’re making me break my rule , I ’m going to take my time with you . ”
27232	27235	27236	27236	he	88	“ Slow , ”
27271	27283	27268	27268	He	88	“ Am I exhausting your patience right now , Ms. Hanna ? ”
27284	27289	27291	27291	my	1543	“ You ’ve been . ”
27317	27333	27309	27309	my	1543	“ You ’re torturing me , actually , but I realize that ’s the point . ”
27334	27342	27343	27343	he	88	“ You do pick things up quickly , ”
27356	27366	27343	27343	he	88	“ You know what I want to see next . ”
27509	27514	27515	27515	he	88	“ Keep it on , ”
27518	27524	27515	27515	he	88	“ Stand up for me . ”
27528	27533	27534	27534	I	1543	“ Let me guess , ”
27615	27619	27620	27620	he	88	“ Do it , ”
27623	27627	27620	27620	he	88	“ Touch yourself . ”
27890	27893	27894	27894	I	1543	“ Julian . ”
27987	27992	27993	27993	he	88	“ Stand for me , ”
28099	28103	28104	28104	Julian	88	“ Three days . ”
28118	28128	28107	28107	he	88	“ You got me to break in three days . ”
28166	28171	28172	28172	he	88	“ Look at me , ”
28195	28207	28208	28208	he	88	“ You do know you ’re playing with fire , right ? ”
28234	28237	28219	28219	I	1543	“ Yes . ”
28289	28292	28293	28293	His	88	“ Good . ”
28394	28406	28389	28389	Julian	88	“ You should see how fucking sexy you look right now . ”
28407	28418	28389	28389	Julian	88	“ Why do n’t you just make me feel it ? ”
28419	28429	28389	28389	Julian	88	“ I ’ll be fucking you harder for that . ”
28430	28434	28435	28435	I	1543	“ Do it , ”
28566	28573	28574	28574	he	88	“ Is this what you wanted ? ”
28581	28598	28574	28574	he	88	“ Or do you want me to pin you down and fuck you on the floor ? ”
28608	28621	28622	28622	he	88	“ Where do you want me to fuck you tomorrow , Sara ? ”
28649	28657	28643	28643	he	88	“ I do n’t care , Julian . ”
28665	28678	28643	28643	he	88	“ I just want you to fuck me and make me come . ”
28679	28708	28709	28709	His	88	“ I will . You ’ve opened the floodgates , Sara , so I have every intention of fucking you whenever and however I want in this office . ”
28720	28731	28732	28732	He	88	“ And I promise I ’ll make that pussy come . ”
28738	28741	28732	28732	He	88	“ Again . ”
28744	28748	28749	28749	I	1543	“ And again . ”
28752	28756	28757	28757	he	88	“ And again , ”
28782	28796	28797	28797	he	88	“ I may just have to carry you home when I ’m done , ”
28852	28874	28844	28844	he	88	“ You ’re such a good girl in my office . Who knew I could get you to be so loud ? ”
28875	28879	28880	28880	I	1543	“ Screw you , ”
29162	29167	29168	29168	Julian	88	“ Look at me , ”
29185	29202	29175	29175	His	88	“ Look at me , Sara . You ’re going to let me watch you come . ”
29252	29258	29249	29249	Julian	88	“ I ’ve got you , ”
29286	29288	29283	29283	he	88	“ fuck ”
29439	29442	29443	29443	His	88	“ Sara . ”
29933	29936	29937	29937	I	1543	“ Fuck . ”
30084	30087	30088	30088	I	1543	“ What ? ”
30091	30105	30081	30081	Emmett	319	“ Think it ’s cool if I bring a girl again this week ? ”
30106	30117	30081	30081	Emmett	319	“ No . I think it 's cruel , actually . ”
30118	30125	30126	30126	Emmett	319	“ To who ? The girl ? ”
30146	30150	30136	30136	him	319	“ Or Mom ? ”
30151	30183	30138	30138	his	319	“ Mom . You ’re teasing her with the idea of marriage despite the fact that we all know you ’re going to take another fifteen to twenty years for that . ”
30204	30212	30213	30213	he	319	“ You guys give me no credit , ”
30222	30260	30213	30213	he	319	“ I date a lot in order to effectively assess my preferences , as well as her true potential . I ’m sure you can understand that , especially since I phrased it in Julian - speak . ”
30261	30265	30213	30213	he	319	“ Very nice . ”
30266	30293	30213	30213	he	319	“ I do n’t appreciate the sarcasm , but at least I can take comfort in the fact that I ’ll still get married before you . ”
30294	30297	30298	30298	I	1543	“ Unlikely , ”
30331	30351	30352	30352	I	1543	“ If you ask about her again , I ’m going to kill you the second I see you , ”
30358	30373	30352	30352	I	1543	“ Would that be worth it though ? Jail time means no fucking Sara . ”
30374	30382	30395	30395	I	1543	“ Do n’t talk about fucking her . ”
30383	30394	30352	30352	I	1543	“ I ’m talking about you fucking her , asshole . ”
30406	30419	30420	30420	I	1543	“ Do n’t talk about her in general is what I mean , ”
30428	30462	30420	30420	I	1543	“ And in case you still smell like last night ’s tequila , I suggest you shower now and get going so you ’re not thirty minutes late like you were last week . ”
30463	30479	30514	30514	I	1543	“ Fine . Hey , anyone ever tell you how much fun you ’re not ? ”
30493	30507	30420	30420	I	1543	“ I ’m hanging up , Emmett . See you at the stadium . ”
30508	30513	30480	30480	I	1543	“ Who ’s that ? ”
30562	30572	30573	30573	Mom	1031	“ You ’re not going to pick it up ? ”
30620	30636	30607	30607	I	1543	“ Since when have you been eager for me to take work calls on Sundays ? ”
30637	30642	30643	30643	she	1031	“ I ’m not , ”
30770	30830	30747	30747	she	1031	“ I just figured it might be someone important calling . And yes , I know , ‘ it ’s always someone important calling , ’ but considering you ’ve let two whole calls go to voicemail since we ’ve been here , I thought maybe something , or someone had taken your mind off of work for once . ”
30831	30853	30854	30854	I	1543	“ Emmett introduces you to a new girlfriend every week . Why not pin your hopes of grandchildren on him instead ? ”
30857	30876	30747	30747	she	1031	“ Because of that reason exactly . He ’s not going to settle down with anyone anytime soon . ”
30877	30884	30885	30885	Emmett	319	“ You do n’t know that ! ”
30946	30952	30953	30953	Emmett	319	“ Gram , no more , ”
31067	31070	31065	31066	the Hoults	135	“ rolled deep ”
31240	31248	31249	31249	she	1031	“ You were so good with them , ”
31252	31263	31249	31249	she	1031	“ You always helped me keep the little ones behaved . ”
31264	31281	31223	31223	Mom	1031	“ Despite being a kid myself . I was ten when you had me babysitting everyone . ”
31282	31313	31314	31314	she	1031	“ But you had fun , remember ? You loved making up games to keep them distracted . I ca n’t even count the number of tantrums you saved us , ”
31326	31346	31314	31314	she	1031	“ You ’re like your father . Very stern , very serious . But you light up around children . ”
31347	31350	31351	31351	I	1543	“ Mom , ”
31354	31359	31360	31360	She	1031	“ Okay , alright . ”
31374	31399	31400	31400	she	1031	“ I ’m sorry . I was just going through the old photo albums last night , and I found so many baby pictures , ”
31403	31423	31400	31400	she	1031	“ I actually have a nice one of Lucie . I do n’t know if you might want that . ”
31439	31448	31424	31424	I	1543	“ No . I do n’t want that . ”
31449	31454	31455	31455	She	1031	“ Okay . Sorry . ”
31492	31497	31498	31498	she	1031	“ Listen , Julian , ”
31521	31527	31518	31518	she	1031	“ Ozzy ’s my grandchild . ”
31541	31550	31551	31551	I	1543	“ Yes . Your drooling , orange grandchild , ”
31610	31656	31567	31567	Emmett	319	“ Anyway , I meant to tell you I made a reservation at Greta ’s for Father ’s Day next week , since that ’s Dad ’s favorite . All six of your cousins will be in attendance this year . Significant others , too . ”
31657	31662	31663	31663	I	1543	“ That sounds good , ”
31687	31711	31677	31677	I	1543	“ There ’s a slight chance I ’ll be away on business , but I doubt it ’ll fall on Father ’s Day . ”
31712	31715	31716	31716	Her	132	“ Oh . ”
31722	31730	31716	31716	Her	132	“ Are you finally selling the thing ? ”
31758	31779	31737	31737	she	132	“ Yes . As soon as possible , and hopefully to Turner and Carter Roth . You ’ve met them . ”
31780	31789	31737	31737	she	132	“ Oh yes , I remember those two . ”
31790	31825	31826	31826	I	1543	“ Yeah , they ’re … idiots . But idiots that can do a lot of good for this stadium . Their resources can help us make this stadium what we all dreamed of , ”
31864	31872	31873	31873	she	1031	“ You ’ve been working so hard , ”
31881	31900	31873	31873	she	1031	“ They would both be so proud of you , Julian . I sincerely hope you know that . ”
31957	31971	31947	31947	Mom	1031	“ Emmett , maybe you should get him a brother to play with . ”
31972	31994	31947	31947	Mom	1031	“ Ma , you got ta be kidding me . Ozzy ’s three . I ca n’t handle another one now . ”
31995	32013	31947	31947	Mom	1031	“ I read somewhere it ’s not good to keep a dog without giving it a friend . ”
32014	32017	32018	32018	Emmett	319	“ Mom . ”
32024	32031	32032	32032	he	319	“ Stop with the grandkid thing , ”
32035	32044	32032	32032	he	319	“ Ask Julian about a girl named Sara . ”
32053	32056	32045	32045	Mom	1031	“ Who ? ”
32319	32322	32312	32312	I	1543	“ What ? ”
32323	32334	32335	32335	I	1543	“ Jesus Christ . Hello to you too , Hoult . ”
32343	32353	32312	32312	I	1543	“ Sorry . I thought you were my brother . ”
32354	32361	32312	32312	I	1543	“ Emmett ? Love that guy . ”
32362	32366	32367	32367	I	1543	“ You would , ”
32373	32387	32388	32388	Turner	319	“ Yeah , I do n’t even know how you two are related , ”
32399	32415	32388	32388	Turner	319	“ Anyway , listen , I know we said we were gon na meet tomorrow … ”
32416	32426	32312	32312	I	1543	“ You ’re not going to cancel on me . ”
32427	32466	32467	32467	he	319	“ Easy , Hoult . I was n’t going to cancel , I was gon na say I know we set it for noon at your office tomorrow , but some … thing just came up for me , ”
32475	32512	32467	32467	he	319	“ I ’m in Miami right now , and I ’m actually going to be flying back to New York at around five tomorrow , so what do you say we all meet up around six ? ”
32555	32563	32564	32564	I	1543	“ Where do you want to meet ? ”
32567	32592	32669	32669	He	1543	“ I really liked that hotel you set me up with a couple weeks back . When I fucked that thing with the ass ? ”
32593	32596	32669	32669	He	1543	“ Cass . ”
32597	32655	32669	32669	He	1543	“ Jesus , you really do n’t forget shit . Yeah , her . They have a few rooftop bars there . A few pools . Figured we could have our meeting on a nice part of the roof with a good view – get ourselves some sun to set the mood to talk Biarritz . Right ? ”
32656	32668	32669	32669	He	1543	“ It ’s going to be ninety degrees out , Turner . ”
32679	32720	32721	32721	he	1543	“ Oh , I know . Did you hear me say pools ? Besides , you can just wear a T - shirt and shorts – you know I do n’t give a fuck . Keep it casual for once , ”
32737	32766	32721	32721	he	1543	“ Matter fact , I have a surprise for Sara , so you should both bring swimsuits , actually . Or something you do n’t mind getting wet . ”
32774	32782	32769	32769	my	1543	“ That ’s not happening at all . ”
32783	32810	32721	32721	he	1543	“ Do n’t say that to me . Also , I sent a little gift basket to your office . Should get there by tomorrow morning . ”
32811	32816	32817	32817	I	1543	“ What is it ? ”
32820	32855	32856	32856	Turner	319	“ Anthrax – the fuck do you think it is ? It ’s surfing gear from my line . Shit that sold out in stores the week it hit , so you ’re welcome , ”
32894	32916	32917	32917	I	1543	“ Jesus Christ , Turner . I ’ll talk to you tomorrow . Six o’clock at the top of The Victorian , ”
32931	32938	32940	32940	SARA	240	“ See you there , buddy . ”
33413	33416	33421	33421	Julian	88	“ Hey . ”
33448	33452	33453	33453	he	88	“ You alright ? ”
33456	33459	33460	33460	I	1543	“ Yes , ”
33465	33475	33460	33460	I	1543	“ You look like you just saw a ghost . ”
33476	33481	33482	33482	I	1543	“ I ’m fine , ”
33597	33603	33604	33604	Julian	88	“ You spilled on yourself , ”
33629	33637	33638	33638	I	1543	“ Oh . I did n’t realize , ”
33704	33708	33694	33697	A part of me	641	“ bang it out ”
33736	33740	33729	33729	Julian	88	“ my office . ”
33758	33791	33729	33729	Julian	88	“ So , I know you ’re probably prepared to meet with the Roths in a few hours , but I should let you know they postponed our meeting till six tonight . ”
33806	33809	33810	33810	I	1543	“ Really ? ”
33827	33837	33823	33823	we	646	“ Actually , yeah . That sounds about right . ”
33838	33863	33882	33882	his	88	“ It does , does n’t it ? Though I should ’ve told you to save your initial surprise for the location he chose . ”
33864	33873	33874	33874	I	1543	“ Oh no . Where did he choose ? ”
33924	33932	33917	33917	he	88	“ He wants us at the hotel . ”
33933	33937	33938	33938	I	1543	“ The hotel ? ”
33941	33945	33946	33946	Julian	88	“ The Victorian . ”
33959	33968	33946	33946	Julian	88	“ I believe you ’re familiar with it . ”
33975	33978	33979	33979	My	1543	“ Yes . ”
33995	33999	33979	33979	My	1543	“ I am . ”
34049	34052	34053	34053	he	88	“ Unfortunately , ”
34074	34101	34053	34053	he	88	“ We wo n’t be meeting in the comfort of a room tonight so much as some private part of the roof , despite this weather . ”
34107	34115	34102	34102	I	1543	“ We ’re going to be burning . ”
34116	34156	34053	34053	he	88	“ I know . I ’m not entirely sure what Turner has up his sleeve for tonight , but as you can see , he sent us a lot of surfing gear that we really have no use for . ”
34162	34168	34102	34102	I	1543	“ What is he on ? ”
34169	34191	34200	34200	Julian	88	“ I wish I knew . But he did say the surprise he had in store for us tonight required swimsuits . ”
34205	34246	34200	34200	Julian	88	“ And while I have no intentions for either of us to play into the swimsuit request , I would recommend you either go home and find a change of clothes or take this to buy something lightweight for tonight . ”
34262	34277	34278	34278	he	88	“ Company expense . You can either buy something or grab it from home , ”
34292	34325	34278	34278	he	88	“ Whichever option you choose , feel free to take the day off till six , since you ’ll be working from then till presumably eight or nine o ’ clock tonight . ”
34326	34329	34278	34278	he	88	“ Oh . ”
34403	34411	34412	34412	I	1543	“ Should I … leave right now ? ”
34415	34423	34424	34424	Julian	88	“ Yes , I ’d prefer that . ”
34439	34473	34474	34474	he	88	“ I was a little eager to make use of the time that opened up after the Roths rescheduled , so I have back - to - back meetings starting in fifteen minutes , ”
34484	34509	34481	34481	he	88	“ In case I ’m not being clear enough , I do n’t regard fifteen minutes as enough time to do anything for pleasure . ”
34521	34528	34560	34560	Julian	88	“ Thank you for the clarification . ”
34529	34535	34560	34560	Julian	88	“ You ’re very welcome . ”
34536	34559	34560	34560	Julian	88	“ But in that case , I should remind you of what you subjected me to on my first day working here . ”
34579	34617	34618	34618	I	1543	“ Bluntly put , Mr. Hoult , you licked my pussy in the elevator for about six seconds before you had to stop . In your opinion , that was what we had time for , so , ”
34624	34646	34618	34618	I	1543	“ I ca n’t help but imagine that fourteen minutes is more than enough time for what I have in mind . ”
34659	34670	34726	34726	He	88	“ And what is it that you have in mind ? ”
34671	34684	34726	34726	He	88	“ I want to finish what I started the night we met . ”
34685	34689	34726	34726	He	88	“ Please clarify . ”
34690	34701	34702	34702	I	1543	“ I want your cock in my mouth , Julian , ”
34713	34725	34702	34702	I	1543	“ And this time , I want to make you come . ”
34741	34747	34748	34748	he	88	“ You ’re killing me , ”
34814	34819	34807	34807	he	88	“ Close the door . ”
34853	34863	34864	34864	Julian	88	“ You ’ve got to be fucking kidding me . ”
34992	34998	34999	34999	Julian	88	“ What are you doing ? ”
35065	35069	35070	35070	he	88	“ Fucking hell , ”
35151	35154	35155	35155	His	88	“ Fuck . ”
35182	35187	35188	35188	Julian	88	“ Christ , Sara , ”
35326	35341	35350	35350	Colin	95	“ Hey , Julian . McKinley ’s here a little early for the meeting . ”
35452	35469	35470	35470	Julian	88	“ If you could get him water or coffee for now , that ’d be great , ”
35483	35494	35470	35470	Julian	88	“ I ’ll meet him in the conference room shortly . ”
35495	35507	35519	35519	his	95	“ Great . He says Eli could n’t make it because – ”
35508	35513	35514	35514	Julian	88	“ That ’s fine , ”
35546	35555	35556	35556	he	95	“ That ’s fine . Just … go , ”
35560	35567	35556	35556	he	95	“ I ’ll be there soon . ”
35697	35701	35702	35702	he	95	“ Get up , ”
35714	35720	35702	35702	he	95	“ Give me your panties . ”
35837	35844	35845	35845	he	95	“ Was that amusing for you ? ”
35870	35880	35860	35860	I	1543	“ You enjoyed tormenting me , did n’t you ? ”
35889	35892	35924	35924	his	88	“ Yes . ”
35893	35920	35921	35921	Julian	88	“ I could feel you smiling against my cock while I was talking to Colin . I ’m glad you had so much fun with that , ”
35961	35971	35972	35972	Julian	88	“ But now that you ’ve had your fun – ”
35988	35997	35972	35972	Julian	88	“ – I ’m going to have mine . ”
36092	36096	36073	36073	He	88	“ Holy shit . ”
36291	36294	36295	36295	I	1543	“ Julian ! ”
36368	36373	36345	36345	he	88	“ Oh my God . ”
36484	36491	36502	36502	His	88	“ Oh my God , Julian … ”
36492	36501	36502	36502	His	88	“ Fuck , I ’m going to come . ”
36555	36560	36561	36561	Julian	88	“ Fuck , Sara , ”
36598	36608	36609	36609	he	88	“ Jesus fucking Christ , you ’re so sexy , ”
36619	36626	36609	36609	he	88	“ Get the fuck up here . ”
36929	36932	36933	36933	Her	240	“ Hey . ”
36946	36960	36933	36933	Her	240	“ I thought you ’d be upstairs already . It ’s past six . ”
36961	36974	36975	36975	I	1543	“ Yes . Turner has kept me painfully aware of the time , ”
36988	36994	36975	36975	I	1543	“ He ’s early again . ”
36995	37005	36933	36933	Her	240	“ Shocking , actually . And you ’re late . ”
37006	37017	36975	36975	I	1543	“ I preferred to wait for you to go in . ”
37018	37033	36933	36933	Her	240	“ Mm . Did n’t think I could handle being alone with those two ? ”
37034	37062	36975	36975	I	1543	“ No , I did n’t want those two to see the way I looked at you tonight . I needed some time to react alone first . ”
37063	37066	36933	36933	Her	240	“ Oh . ”
37108	37116	37117	37117	Sara	240	“ So have you fully reacted yet ? ”
37131	37134	37135	37135	I	1543	“ Almost , ”
37304	37318	37319	37319	he	319	“ I ’ve got a surprise for you . Do n’t you worry , ”
37430	37435	37436	37436	Julian	88	“ I ’m sorry , ”
37442	37462	37436	37436	Julian	88	“ I ’m not drinking tequila with these guys . We ’ll get actual drinks when this is over . ”
37525	37544	37545	37545	Turner	319	“ Obviously , we ’re going to need more than a few rooms when we go out there , ”
37571	37597	37598	37598	He	87	“ It ’s not gon na be just me and Carter out there . I ’ve got my business advisors , financial consultants , lawyers . ”
37674	37683	37684	37684	Julian	88	“ I look forward to meeting your advisors , ”
37688	37718	37684	37684	Julian	88	“ You should . They ’re smart men . I ’m bringing the whole fuckin ’ team , and they sure as shit ai n’t gon na share rooms . ”
37719	37751	37752	37752	Julian	88	“ It ’s high season , but once you agree on an actual date , I ’ll be sure to call the resort to arrange for the proper amount of suites , ”
37755	37779	37780	37780	Turner	319	“ Yeah … I ’m bringing a bunch of old fucks who sleep at like , ten , so their rooms actually matter , ”
37817	37839	37806	37806	he	319	“ The four of us though … I hope you know we ’re going to have some late nights in Biarritz . ”
37840	37846	37847	37847	Julian	88	“ And why is that ? ”
37850	37899	37806	37806	he	319	“ Well , I have n’t been out there in years , and you two are the experts . You got ta show me where the gems are . I got ta feel like I wanna take my business to that town , you know what I mean ? ”
37900	37916	37917	37917	Julian	88	“ That just sounds like an excuse for you to get shitfaced instead of work , ”
37954	37977	37978	37978	Julian	88	“ What can I say ? You know me by now , Hoult . I work hard , and I play hard . ”
38021	38053	38009	38009	he	88	“ Well , regardless , I ’ll at least have your advisors on board at that point . That ’ll guarantee me at least a couple sober minds to talk to . ”
38054	38079	38080	38080	Turner	319	“ Yeah , maybe you can all talk shop and sleep at ten while I take Sara out for drinks . How about that ? ”
38090	38099	38100	38100	Julian	88	“ How about we get back on topic ? ”
38605	38611	38612	38612	I	1543	“ What ’s going on ? ”
38629	38656	38687	38688	SARA Lights	240	“ Oh , I was just telling Julian that before we set a date for the trip , we got ta make sure of one thing . ”
38662	38667	38657	38657	I	1543	“ What ’s that ? ”
38673	38685	38668	38668	Turner	319	“ We got ta make sure you know how to surf . ”
38821	38823	38817	38817	He	319	“ Sarah ”
38871	38891	38892	38892	he	319	“ Could n’t possibly commit to a date for the trip till I knew Sara had the basics down , ”
38908	38933	38892	38892	he	319	“ Besides , you ca n’t possibly say no when I went to such great lengths to make this a nice night . Right ? ”
39018	39040	39041	39041	he	88	“ He ’s trying to see how much he can get me to do for free before committing to the trip , ”
39068	39082	39064	39064	his	88	“ And , obviously , he wants to see you in a swimsuit . ”
39083	39089	39090	39090	I	1543	“ I figured as much , ”
39134	39216	39129	39129	I	1543	“ It ’s not a big deal , Julian . We ’ll take a swim , we ’ll pretend to party for him , and then we ’ll set a date for the trip . If humoring Turner gets us to Biarritz and connects you with his advisors , it ’s worth it . At least then you wo n’t have to deal with trying to talk to him or Carter about business they clearly do n’t know how to discuss . ”
39240	39243	39244	39244	I	1543	“ What ? ”
39265	39271	39260	39260	Julian	88	“ That was oddly arousing . ”
39272	39276	39260	39260	Julian	88	“ What was ? ”
39277	39293	39260	39260	Julian	88	“ You taking control . I can only imagine how good you look on top . ”
39300	39315	39294	39294	I	1543	“ We can find out tonight . That is , if you ’re interested . ”
39316	39331	39332	39332	Julian	88	“ I think you know at this point that I ’m interested , Sara , ”
39339	39348	39332	39332	Julian	88	“ Whether I want to be or not . ”
39353	39362	39349	39349	My	1543	“ You had to add that last part ? ”
39363	39369	39294	39294	I	1543	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
39370	39380	39381	39381	I	1543	“ I do n’t know . Because it hurt , ”
39385	39396	39397	39397	Julian	88	“ You know what it ’s like to have rules , ”
39402	39413	39397	39397	Julian	88	“ You should know how it feels to break them . ”
39414	39426	39427	39427	I	1543	“ It ’s felt nothing but good for me so far , ”
39436	39449	39427	39427	I	1543	“ But I take it you regret what ’s happened between us . ”
40016	40024	40003	40005	a normal woman	700	“ You are so , so bad … ”
40221	40226	40250	40255	the girl in the blue bikini	709	“ There she is . ”
40850	40858	40859	40859	Turner	319	“ You look good in this swimsuit , ”
40926	40934	40935	40935	he	88	“ Riding is n’t the hard part , ”
40948	40961	40935	40935	he	88	“ Paddling out then popping up – that ’s half the battle . ”
41124	41126	41107	41107	he	88	“ waves ”
41355	41363	41353	41353	him	88	“ was trying to fuck with him . ”
41364	41369	41370	41370	I	1543	“ Dolphins are smart , ”
41374	41381	41382	41382	Turner	319	“ And a little shitty sometimes , ”
41385	41432	41382	41382	Turner	319	“ He was circling me like he knew that ’s what sharks do in the movies . Then right when I was gon na have a heart attack , he popped up with this big smile , like ‘ psych , got you , bitch . ’ ”
41503	41508	41509	41509	He	88	“ What are these ? ”
41531	41534	41535	41535	We	727	“ Whoa . ”
41561	41567	41554	41554	he	88	“ Sore spot , eh ? ”
41568	41576	41577	41577	I	1543	“ That ’s incredibly rude , Turner , ”
41595	41603	41604	41604	he	88	“ What , are you embarrassed now ? ”
41607	41628	41604	41604	he	88	“ Do n’t be . Nothing wrong with having a bit of a dark side . Lord knows I do . ”
41660	41663	41629	41629	My	1543	“ Roth . ”
41697	41705	41706	41706	Julian	88	“ We ’re done here , correct ? ”
41722	41734	41735	41735	Turner	319	“ She did great . Ca n’t fucking wait for Biarritz , ”
41769	41783	41756	41756	Julian	88	“ Perfect . Have your assistants email Colin or me in the morning . ”
41784	41793	41756	41756	Julian	88	“ You got it . Hey , Sara . ”
41822	41832	41833	41833	he	319	“ What ’s the ‘ F ’ stand for ? ”
41878	41883	41884	41884	I	1543	“ Goodnight , Turner , ”
41887	41894	41884	41884	I	1543	“ Drink lots of water tonight . ”
41902	41911	41895	41895	He	319	“ Ai n’t my first rodeo , love . ”
42178	42186	42170	42170	Julian	88	“ What did Turner say to you ? ”
42209	42215	42216	42216	My	1543	“ Not much , actually . ”
42229	42239	42216	42216	My	1543	“ What ’s going on ? Are you okay ? ”
42409	42414	42415	42415	I	1543	“ I ca n’t … ”
42459	42465	42466	42466	My	1543	“ I need a minute . ”
42492	42500	42485	42485	Julian	88	“ You ’re having a panic attack . ”
42501	42505	42485	42485	Julian	88	“ I know . ”
42506	42527	42528	42528	he	88	“ If you ’ve had them before , then you know everything is going to be fine . Just breathe , ”
42557	42565	42541	42541	I	1543	“ Do you know what triggers these ? ”
42566	42580	42485	42485	Julian	88	“ Lots of things . Have n’t had one in a long time . ”
42581	42590	42541	42541	I	1543	“ What does it feel like right now ? ”
42591	42607	42608	42608	I	1543	“ Ca n’t breathe . Heart ’s beating fast . Feels like I could die . ”
42622	42643	42608	42608	I	1543	“ I know it sounds like I ’m being a drama queen . When I say that . I just – ”
42644	42660	42661	42661	Julian	88	“ I ’m informed on panic attacks . I know you ’re not being dramatic , ”
42675	42682	42665	42665	he	88	“ Stand up and turn around . ”
42683	42686	42691	42691	him	88	“ What ? ”
42698	42742	42665	42665	he	88	“ I ’m not about to fuck you in the middle of your panic attack , Sara , so do n’t look at me like that . I want you to run your wrists under the cold water and see if that helps . ”
42847	42854	42855	42855	I	1543	“ You ’ve seen everything already , ”
42872	42885	42855	42855	I	1543	“ I ’m not interested in getting hard right now , Sara . ”
42933	42940	42941	42941	I	1543	“ Do you get them too ? ”
42944	42947	42941	42941	I	1543	“ What ? ”
42948	42952	42929	42929	my	1543	“ Panic attacks . ”
42958	42961	42953	42953	He	88	“ No . ”
42977	42985	42986	42986	I	1543	“ Where ’d you learn that trick ? ”
43023	43037	43038	43038	he	88	“ Let ’s get you home before Turner realizes we ’re still here , ”
43048	43057	43047	43047	JULIAN	88	“ How is everything so far , gentlemen ? ”
43220	43232	43233	43233	Lukas	355	“ We should be done with everything around Lia ’s birthday , ”
43236	43248	43233	43233	Lukas	355	“ So it can be a birthday - housewarming combo party . ”
43249	43273	43202	43202	he	355	“ Christ , you sound like you drive a mini van and shit on the refs at your kids ’ Little League games . ”
43274	43289	43290	43290	Lukas	355	“ That ’s actually the goal at some point , minus the ref abuse , ”
43293	43306	43307	43307	he	355	“ By the way , you should bring Sara to the party , ”
43320	43334	43202	43202	he	355	“ You should stop letting your girlfriend influence the things we talk about . ”
43335	43377	43378	43378	he	355	“ That suggestion was actually all mine , though I wo n’t deny that Lia ’s been rooting for you two to become some sort of thing . Which is strange , honestly , because she loves Sara , but you , ”
43381	43386	43378	43378	he	355	“ not so much . ”
43387	43408	43202	43202	he	355	“ I would say the feeling is mutual , but I ’d prefer you not throw a tantrum in public . ”
43409	43421	43422	43422	Lukas	355	“ Good call . Any decent man would defend his woman , ”
43425	43455	43422	43422	Lukas	355	“ I ’m sure you ’ve been well acquainted with the feeling lately . Something tells me you do n’t particularly enjoy watching the Roths slobber all over Sara . ”
43456	43462	43202	43202	he	355	“ You ’re not incorrect . ”
43698	43706	43707	43707	Emmett	319	“ Who are you texting , anyway ? ”
43718	43722	43707	43707	Emmett	319	“ No one . ”
43723	43734	43735	43735	Emmett	319	“ Well , no one sure has you worked up , ”
43766	43775	43776	43776	he	355	“ You have got to be shitting me , ”
43790	43798	43776	43776	he	355	“ Mind your own business , Emmett . ”
43799	43809	43810	43810	he	355	“ How the fuck is this not my business ? ”
43820	43836	43810	43810	he	355	“ I thought you were putting an official end to that chapter in your life . ”
43837	43855	43776	43776	he	355	“ Trust me , I am . Do you not see me trying to sell that resort ? ”
43869	43903	43856	43856	Emmett	319	“ You know , it ’s fucking crazy . You ’re a hard - ass ninety - nine - point - nine percent of the time , and then the other one percent – ”
43904	43910	43810	43810	he	355	“ Your math is off . ”
43911	43941	43942	43942	Emmett	319	“ Shut up . Listen to me . I do n’t ever give you shit , Julian . I ’m as easy as they come . You know that , ”
43946	43993	43942	43942	Emmett	319	“ So when I say that you need to cut that crazy person off , I fucking mean it . You do n’t owe anyone anything . Aside from your family – your real family – you should n’t have to break your back for anyone . ”
44165	44170	44171	44171	I	1543	“ Move past it , ”
44175	44185	44171	44171	I	1543	“ How much money are you sending this time ? ”
44186	44193	44171	44171	I	1543	“ I said move past it . ”
44255	44270	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ Fine , well now you owe me a couple minutes talking about Sara . ”
44271	44287	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ I ca n’t at all grasp why you ’re so interested in this topic . ”
44288	44326	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ Well , I have n’t seen you actually invested in a girl in a long fucking time , and the sooner you settle down and have kids , the sooner Mom stops bugging me about it . ”
44337	44350	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ You gon na take her on a real date anytime soon ? ”
44351	44355	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ Absolutely not . ”
44356	44362	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ Why the fuck not ? ”
44363	44378	44327	44327	Emmett	319	“ I see her every day at work . What more do I need ? ”
44394	44403	44404	44404	he	319	“ Wait . Is that a serious question ? ”
44429	44450	44420	44420	Lukas	355	“ He just said he ’ll never ask Sara out , because he already sees her at work every day . ”
44456	44466	44451	44451	Lukas	355	“ Jesus . Yeah , that sounds about right . ”
44498	44504	44505	44505	she	333	“ Is everything okay here ? ”
44509	44521	44522	44522	I	1543	“ Yes , I ’ll just take the check , please , ”
44581	44608	44574	44574	I	1543	“ You know , you ’re both fairly intolerable on a regular basis , but when your forces combine , it can really clear a room . ”
44609	44614	44615	44615	Emmett	319	“ You love us , ”
44631	44641	44642	44642	I	1543	“ Enjoy the rest of your lunch , gentlemen , ”
44680	44683	44688	44688	He	319	“ Hey . ”
44684	44687	44688	44688	He	319	“ What ? ”
44694	44788	44688	44688	He	319	“ Listen , do me a favor , alright ? Do n’t … text ol’ Crazy Person back till after Sunday . Give yourself a break from that shit , and just enjoy the good things going on right now , like the fact that you got a date set for this trip , the hard part is over , and you may or may not have a girl you ’re interested in . Focus on just the good . For the next five days . That ’s all I ask of you . ”
44792	44801	44789	44789	I	1543	“ So live like you , you mean . ”
44802	44818	44819	44819	Emmett	319	“ Yes . Why the fuck else do you think I ’m always so happy ? ”
44828	44851	44819	44819	Emmett	319	“ If I like something , man , I let myself have it – without stressing myself out about the possible consequences . ”
44852	44864	44789	44789	I	1543	“ That ’s incredibly reckless , I ’m sure you know . ”
44865	44886	44887	44887	Emmett	319	“ Of course . That ’s why I ’m not you . I ’m not a fuckin ’ workaholic billionaire , ”
44890	44965	44966	44966	he	319	“ But since you already are , you might as well give yourself a couple days to actually chill and indulge in the things you want . I ’m not telling you to take a whole week of sick days and bail on work , I ’m just telling you to relax for once . Do n’t force yourself to put out all the little fires . Just let them burn for a bit , ”
44969	44998	44966	44966	he	319	“ Till Sunday – how about that ? Then after our big fat Father ’s Day brunch , you can go back to being ol’ No Fun Julian . ”
44999	45009	45047	45047	SARA	240	“ You really sold it with the last line . ”
45013	45016	45010	45010	Emmett	319	“ Right ? ”
45022	45027	45017	45017	I	1543	“ See you Sunday . ”
45028	45034	45035	45035	he	319	“ Just think about it ! ”
45048	45072	45073	45073	Mom	1031	“ What kind of assignment is this ? You ’ve had a thousand deadlines , Sara . You would still always text back , ”
45169	45180	45181	45181	I	1543	“ It ’s … a very complicated assignment , Mama , ”
45191	45219	45220	45220	Mom	1031	“ Tell Robin you ca n’t work any more Sundays . Tell her that will put less pressure on you , and you ’ll have more energy , ”
45268	45277	45278	45278	I	1543	“ I ’ll talk to her about it , ”
45389	45408	45409	45409	I	1543	“ Listen , Ma – Robin ’s coming by , so I got ta get off the phone , ”
45438	45463	45423	45423	I	1543	“ Yeah . Okay . I promise I ’ll call you tonight to talk longer . Okay , will do – bye - bye . ”
45537	45548	45531	45531	he	88	“ I ’m almost certain my name is n’t Robin . ”
45549	45562	45563	45563	I	1543	“ Yes . It ’s not . It ’s just , um … ”
45568	45574	45563	45563	I	1543	“ The thing is that – ”
45575	45593	45594	45594	he	88	“ It ’s okay , you do n’t have to explain if you do n’t want to , ”
45604	45621	45594	45594	he	88	“ I only came out here to see if you wanted to join me for lunch . ”
45626	45634	45622	45622	My	1543	“ I thought you just had lunch ? ”
45635	45651	45594	45594	he	88	“ I spent it in poor company . I ’d like to do it over . ”
45652	45655	45656	45656	I	1543	“ Oh . ”
45667	45678	45679	45679	I	1543	“ Is this so we can discuss the Biarritz itinerary ? ”
45682	45707	45594	45594	he	88	“ No . Remember , we ’ll be doing that with Colin at three in the conference room . I reminded you this morning . ”
45708	45715	45716	45716	Wanted	149	“ You did , I just – ”
45732	45736	45716	45716	Wanted	149	“ Never mind , ”
45747	45753	45737	45737	I	1543	“ Let ’s go eat . ”
45814	45821	45822	45822	I	1543	“ Do you come here often ? ”
45829	45842	45822	45822	I	1543	“ Not as often as other places . Why do you ask ? ”
45843	45850	45822	45822	I	1543	“ You know everyone ’s names . ”
45851	45881	45822	45822	I	1543	“ I try to remember names once they ’ve been given . It ’s only ever been helpful to me , especially when it comes to running a business . ”
45887	45907	45882	45882	I	1543	“ That makes sense . Is that the trick to owning the empire that you do at your age ? ”
45908	45913	45914	45914	he	88	“ One of several , ”
45917	45940	45914	45914	he	88	“ It also took a fair amount of sleepless nights and busting my ass . Nothing you do n’t know about though . ”
45986	46012	46013	46013	I	1543	“ Yes , of course , all your ass - busting led to where you are now , whereas mine was apparently all in vain , ”
46019	46040	46013	46013	I	1543	“ I do n’t know why I put so much time into that company when they treated me like shit . ”
46069	46091	46065	46065	He	1543	“ I take it you do n’t want me to get you your job back there when our contract is finished . ”
46092	46101	46102	46102	I	1543	“ No , actually . I do n’t , ”
46111	46128	46129	46129	he	1543	“ Are there any other magazines under Hoult Publishing that you ’d like to work for ? ”
46132	46135	46136	46136	I	1543	“ Several , ”
46152	46171	46147	46147	I	1543	“ Actually , one magazine in particular is the reason I even switched majors to journalism in college . ”
46172	46175	46176	46176	He	1543	“ Really ? ”
46182	46185	46176	46176	He	1543	“ Which ? ”
46186	46190	46191	46191	I	1543	“ Una Magazine , ”
46194	46207	46191	46191	I	1543	“ I think your company acquired it two or three years ago . ”
46208	46211	46147	46147	I	1543	“ Four . ”
46226	46250	46191	46191	I	1543	“ Right . It ’s named after The Una , which was one of the first women ’s periodicals back in the day . ”
46251	46258	46191	46191	I	1543	“ The eighteen hundreds , correct ? ”
46259	46265	46266	46266	I	1543	“ Eighteen fifty - three , ”
46276	46287	46266	46266	I	1543	“ You keep knowing more than I think you would . ”
46288	46296	46191	46191	I	1543	“ Thank you , I ’m sure . ”
46300	46354	46297	46297	I	1543	“ It ’s a compliment . But anyway , that ’s pretty much my dream magazine . It had a very significant impact on me during my most formative years , and if I could work for them and help change even one other girl ’s life then I ’d be incredibly grateful . ”
46387	46406	46355	46355	Julian	88	“ I ’ll be sure to find you a position there when we ’re done with the Roths . ”
46412	46415	46407	46407	I	1543	“ Really ? ”
46416	46432	46407	46407	I	1543	“ Did I not promise you that when you first agreed to work for me ? ”
46433	46440	46407	46407	I	1543	“ You did , I just … ”
46441	46447	46407	46407	I	1543	“ Did n’t believe me . ”
46448	46485	46407	46407	I	1543	“ I ’m pretty sure I believed you , but I really did n’t know you at all at the time , and I was n’t entirely sure anything coming out of your mouth was true . ”
46499	46504	46494	46494	his	88	“ That angers me . ”
46511	46546	46505	46505	I	1543	“ It ’s not meant as a slight toward you , Julian . I just did n’t know you at all back then . I still do n’t know that much about you now . ”
46547	46555	46494	46494	his	88	“ What do you want to know ? ”
46575	46590	46591	46591	I	1543	“ What do n’t I want to know is probably a more appropriate question , ”
46605	46609	46591	46591	I	1543	“ Start small . ”
46633	46636	46637	46637	I	1543	“ Okay . ”
46651	46664	46637	46637	I	1543	“ You mentioned you have a brother . Tell me about him . ”
46665	46682	46637	46637	I	1543	“ Emmett ? He ’s the one who barged in on us the night we met . ”
46683	46690	46691	46691	I	1543	“ You ’ve mentioned that before , ”
46694	46704	46691	46691	I	1543	“ And with deep irritation , might I add . ”
46705	46719	46720	46720	Julian	88	“ He lives to irritate me deeply , so that would make sense , ”
46739	46772	46728	46728	he	88	“ He ’s five years younger than me , and were it not for the fact that we share many of the same features , no one would believe we were related . ”
46773	46783	46784	46784	I	1543	“ Now I ’m curious to see a picture , ”
46809	46817	46818	46818	he	88	“ I do n’t have many pictures , ”
46825	46837	46838	46838	he	88	“ This is about the best you ’re going to get , ”
46866	46874	46875	46875	I	1543	“ Wow . Look at that smile , ”
46918	46928	46911	46911	they	778	“ You look so happy . When was this ? ”
46929	46963	46974	46974	his	88	“ Last year , when the Empires won the American League pennant . First time since the eighties , and the first time in my era of ownership , so that was nice . ”
46994	47000	47001	47001	I	1543	“ And who ’s this ? ”
47071	47080	47081	47081	he	88	“ That ’s my grandma . Rosemarie Hoult , ”
47096	47129	47081	47081	he	88	“ She immigrated from Germany when she was eighteen , and the first thing she did when she arrived was go to a baseball game . She said it felt appropriately American . ”
47130	47135	47136	47136	I	1543	“ Sounds about right , ”
47142	47154	47136	47136	I	1543	“ I ’m going to assume it was an Empires game . ”
47155	47218	47081	47081	he	88	“ Absolutely . She was hell - bent on learning every detail of the game , and her sisters were very much disinterested , so she went alone , and eventually , my grandfather spotted her . He was an usher , and the day she sat in his section – according to him – he decided he had to marry her . ”
47219	47228	47136	47136	I	1543	“ Oh God , that ’s too cute . ”
47229	47233	47234	47234	Julian	88	“ It is . ”
47257	47269	47243	47243	I	1543	“ Needless to say , we grew up an Empires family . ”
47270	47278	47279	47279	I	1543	“ And now you own the team . ”
47284	47305	47279	47279	I	1543	“ If that ’s not the happiest story I ’ve ever heard , then I do n’t know what is . ”
47311	47335	47336	47336	he	88	“ Yes , well , there ’s certainly a lot that happened in between , but ultimately , it ’s a happy story , ”
47427	47434	47421	47421	I	1543	“ Was there … something that – ”
47435	47442	47443	47443	Julian	88	“ Tell me about your family , ”
47477	47487	47470	47470	He	88	“ You told your mother my name was Robin . ”
47499	47514	47488	47488	I	1543	“ If you ’d like to explain that now , I ’m all ears . ”
47529	47553	47554	47554	I	1543	“ Robin was my last boss . I said her name because my mom … does n’t know I quit June Magazine yet . ”
47568	47600	47554	47554	I	1543	“ She sees that place as my miracle job – prestigious , decent pay , full health benefits . So , I ’ve been acting as if I still work there . ”
47601	47624	47658	47658	He	88	“ Why ca n’t you tell her you now work for Hoult Communications ? I imagine that would sound even more prestigious . ”
47625	47642	47643	47643	I	1543	“ Well , because my contract with Hoult Communications ends within a few months , sir , ”
47673	47684	47658	47658	He	88	“ I ’m glad you ’re so pleased with yourself . ”
47685	47694	47658	47658	He	88	“ Getting reactions out of you is fun . ”
47695	47704	47705	47705	he	88	“ I hope you and Emmett never meet , ”
47715	47736	47705	47705	he	88	“ Can you not tell your mom that after this contract is over , you ’ll be with Hoult Publishing ? ”
47743	47802	47737	47737	I	1543	“ Again , this is no slight to you , but I would rather not tell her anything like that until a contract has been signed , and everything is solid . She is absolutely paranoid and untrusting when it comes to me , and she leaves no stone unturned when questioning even minor changes in my life . ”
47869	47886	47864	47864	he	88	“ Una Magazine is based near Columbus Circle . Is that close to where you live ? ”
47887	47914	47864	47864	he	88	“ No , but I can take the D train from Broadway - Lafayette . I live on Mulberry Street . I ’m a downtown girl . ”
47915	47921	47864	47864	he	88	“ I prefer downtown myself . ”
47922	47930	47864	47864	he	88	“ Oh ? Where do you live ? ”
47931	47934	47864	47864	he	88	“ TriBeCa . ”
47943	47957	47935	47935	I	1543	“ Of course . I ’m sure you own entire buildings in TriBeCa . ”
47958	47974	47864	47864	he	88	“ No . Just one . But I have others nearby in SoHo and DUMBO . ”
47975	47982	47983	47983	I	1543	“ I was just teasing you , ”
47986	48030	47983	47983	I	1543	“ But thank you for reminding me of the full extent of your wealth . Meanwhile , I ’m just hoping I can afford to buy a five hundred - square - foot studio in this city before I turn thirty - five . ”
48031	48047	47864	47864	he	88	“ Well , I hear Una Magazine compensates well , so you ’re in luck . ”
48048	48052	48053	48053	I	1543	“ Oh yeah ? ”
48058	48074	48053	48053	I	1543	“ What else do you hear about Una , since you know so very much ? ”
48084	48102	48075	48075	He	1543	“ I know it ’s a women ’s magazine that deals specifically with mental health and trauma . ”
48217	48220	48221	48221	I	1543	“ Um . ”
48259	48270	48271	48271	Julian	88	“ Why did that particular magazine influence you so much ? ”
48319	48322	48323	48323	I	1543	“ Reasons , ”
48332	48343	48323	48323	I	1543	“ I ’m not sure that constitutes as an answer . ”
48344	48357	48358	48358	I	1543	“ Why is n’t your purchase of the Empires a happy story ? ”
48365	48373	48361	48361	He	1543	“ Touché . How ’s your paillard ? ”
48374	48378	48379	48379	I	1543	“ Very good . ”
48384	48389	48379	48379	I	1543	“ And your steak ? ”
48390	48393	48361	48361	He	1543	“ Excellent . ”
48519	48529	48530	48530	I	1543	“ Okay , I guess I ’ll see you … ”
48588	48595	48569	48569	he	88	“ Okay , later . Bye . ”
48613	48617	48608	48608	I	1543	“ Shut up ! ”
48907	48914	48915	48915	She	240	“ Oh my God , Julian . ”
48929	48934	48915	48915	She	240	“ You scared me . ”
48935	48940	48915	48915	She	240	“ I ’m sorry . ”
48941	48948	48949	48949	she	240	“ You do n’t sound it , ”
48972	48975	48960	48960	Her	240	“ What ? ”
48976	48985	48986	48986	I	1543	“ You did n’t respond to my text , ”
49000	49008	49009	49009	She	240	“ What was I supposed to say ? ”
49022	49031	49032	49032	I	1543	“ You could have let me kiss you , ”
49035	49059	49032	49032	I	1543	“ I ’ve done it before . In fact , I ’ve put my mouth on just about every part of your body . ”
49060	49077	49078	49078	she	240	“ Do n’t get me turned on right now . Colin should be here in ten , ”
49094	49106	49032	49032	I	1543	“ He should be here now . Why is he late ? ”
49107	49152	49032	49032	I	1543	“ Whoever he was meeting at the stadium was n’t there when he arrived , so he had to wait . He asked me to tell you , and he said he did n’t call because he did n’t want to disrupt your meeting . ”
49153	49163	49164	49164	I	1543	“ Fair enough . Are those extras you printed ? ”
49176	49182	49032	49032	I	1543	“ Yes . Want one ? ”
49183	49186	49032	49032	I	1543	“ Please . ”
49237	49248	49217	49217	she	240	“ Are you peeking up my skirt , Mr. Hoult ? ”
49249	49252	49253	49253	I	1543	“ Yes , ”
49260	49263	49264	49264	I	1543	“ Colin , ”
49285	49306	49307	49307	I	1543	“ Yes , she told me McKinley was n’t there when you got to the stadium . It ’s fine , ”
49372	49396	49397	49397	I	1543	“ If he says he ’ll be there soon , just wait it out for him , Colin . You ’re already there , ”
49444	49465	49441	49441	I	1543	“ I ’ll review the itinerary with Sara for now . We ’ll catch you up once you get back . ”
49466	49476	49477	49477	Sara	240	“ Wow . You are such an understanding boss , ”
49485	49491	49493	49493	my	1543	“ What can I say . ”
49528	49544	49519	49519	I	1543	“ Do me a favor . Read me the time of our flight next week ? ”
49545	49560	49519	49519	I	1543	“ May I sit , or would you like me to stay like this ? ”
49561	49566	49567	49567	I	1543	“ Stay like this , ”
49581	49589	49567	49567	I	1543	“ Now what time is our flight ? ”
49609	49618	49619	49619	Sara	240	“ Six - fifteen private charter from Teterboro , ”
49633	49637	49638	49638	I	1543	“ Good girl , ”
49648	49658	49638	49638	I	1543	“ And what time do we arrive in Biarritz ? ”
49678	49682	49685	49685	her	240	“ We arrive … ”
49692	49701	49685	49685	her	240	“ Oh God , what are you doing ? ”
49702	49711	49685	49685	her	240	“ I ’m admiring how wet you are . ”
49712	49732	49685	49685	her	240	“ I mean are you going to do more than that ? Because I ca n’t take the teasing . ”
49733	49737	49738	49738	I	1543	“ You can , ”
49743	49757	49738	49738	I	1543	“ And you will . Now tell me what time our flight arrives . ”
49758	49765	49766	49766	Sara	240	“ Eight at night in Biarritz , ”
49804	49809	49810	49810	I	1543	“ Not so loud , ”
49838	49841	49836	49836	her	240	“ thank God ”
49853	49869	49836	49836	her	240	“ Now tell me how much time we have in Biarritz before the Roths arrive . ”
49870	49918	49836	49836	her	240	“ You and I will be arriving the night before the Roths , so I can get acquainted with the property . Colin will be arriving the next morning , the same time that Turner , Carter and their advisors touch down . Oh God , Julian … ”
49944	49947	49948	49948	She	240	“ Julian … ”
49969	49977	49961	49961	I	1543	“ Please . Tell me what now . ”
49978	49991	49992	49992	I	1543	“ Unbutton your shirt . Only enough to pull your bra down , ”
50032	50036	50014	50014	she	240	“ What now ? ”
50049	50059	50037	50037	I	1543	“ I want you to sit on my cock . ”
50115	50118	50119	50119	I	1543	“ Easy , ”
50137	50140	50119	50119	I	1543	“ Fuck . ”
50205	50213	50214	50214	she	240	“ God , it does n’t stop , ”
50221	50226	50214	50214	she	240	“ Am I close ? ”
50227	50232	50197	50197	she	240	“ Few inches left . ”
50233	50246	50247	50247	she	240	“ Holy shit , I just felt you get so much harder , ”
50250	50257	50197	50197	she	240	“ Keep talking dirty like that . ”
50258	50265	50197	50197	she	240	“ I ’m not trying to . ”
50266	50274	50275	50275	I	1543	“ That ’s why I like it , ”
50303	50306	50283	50283	she	240	“ Breathe . ”
50369	50378	50379	50379	she	240	“ God , you feel so fucking big , ”
50394	50399	50386	50386	she	240	“ Take it slow . ”
50410	50415	50386	50386	she	240	“ Breathe for me . ”
50416	50419	50420	50420	she	240	“ Breathing , ”
50424	50439	50386	50386	she	240	“ Good girl . Sit all the way . Give me all your weight . ”
50488	50495	50496	50496	she	240	“ Oh … that feels nice , ”
50508	50517	50496	50496	she	240	“ Oh God , that feels really nice . ”
50518	50521	50522	50522	I	1543	“ Good . ”
50537	50541	50542	50542	I	1543	“ Keep going . ”
50555	50572	50548	50548	she	240	“ Keep riding me like that . Just like that . That feels so fucking good . ”
50656	50669	50670	50670	Sara	240	“ Oh God , Julian . I ’m going to be loud , ”
50673	50677	50678	50678	I	1543	“ Be loud , ”
50705	50708	50709	50709	I	1543	“ Shit , ”
50712	50717	50709	50709	I	1543	“ I warned you . ”
50718	50723	50724	50724	I	1543	“ I liked it . ”
50772	50789	50790	50790	I	1543	“ Come on my cock , Sara . I can feel your pussy tightening around me , ”
50857	50864	50849	50850	The visual	806	“ Come inside me , Julian . ”
50983	51010	51011	51011	she	240	“ I had a question about who would be giving the tour on day two . Is it going to be the staff there or me ? ”
51038	51070	51071	51071	I	1543	“ It ’s going to be a bit of both , depending on how well acquainted we can get you with the resort in the time that we ’re there alone , ”
51144	51153	51154	51154	Lia	1543	“ Thank God it ’s finally perfect out . ”
51248	51259	51366	51366	She	240	“ Maybe your sex life with Julian controls the weather . ”
51282	51299	51265	51265	I	1543	“ I hesitate to ask , but what in the fresh hell are you talking about ? ”
51300	51308	51309	51309	she	240	“ How do you not see it ? ”
51312	51365	51309	51309	she	240	“ The heat wave came when you guys were being cold and mean to each other . Now it ’s gone because you ’ve been having nonstop sweaty office sex . And it ’s particularly cool out today because you guys … really went for it this morning , I mean damn . ”
51397	51407	51366	51366	She	240	“ I think he learned that move from Lukas . ”
51408	51411	51412	51412	I	1543	“ Lia ! ”
51416	51419	51412	51412	I	1543	“ Ew ! ”
51420	51449	51450	51450	Lia	1543	“ What ? I ’m talking about the location , not the actual positions ! But fine , fine , Lukas did not invent fucking in the bathroom , ”
51588	51599	51600	51600	he	1543	“ I need to get my fill before I go , ”
51642	51656	51657	51657	Lia	1543	“ I take it all the people in the office know by now ? ”
51667	51675	51657	51657	Lia	1543	“ That you ’re sleeping with Julian ? ”
51676	51693	51614	51614	he	1543	“ I think if you say it any louder , Lia , they ’ll definitely know . ”
51694	51711	51712	51712	Lia	1543	“ I ’m pretty sure it ’s not my volume that ’s giving you guys away , ”
51715	51734	51712	51712	Lia	1543	“ Did you not tell me you guys had a moaning contest in the conference room on Wednesday ? ”
51735	51748	51614	51614	he	1543	“ I ’m almost certain I did n’t phrase it that way . ”
51749	51758	51759	51759	Lia	1543	“ You ’re starting to talk like him , ”
51762	51770	51771	51771	I	1543	“ I take that as a compliment , ”
51774	51804	51614	51614	he	1543	“ Oh God , you guys are gross . Your level of admiration for each other is almost self - congratulatory , because you ’re basically the same person . ”
51820	51825	51826	51826	Lia	1543	“ It ’s true ! ”
51829	51876	51877	51877	Lia	1543	“ But I secretly love that about you two . You both are very similar in great ways , and that ’s exactly why I called it in the first place that you ’d make an awesome couple . Me . Lia . I said it , ”
51884	51903	51877	51877	Lia	1543	“ I actually made a bet about it , which reminds me that Lukas owes me twenty dollars . ”
51904	51910	51911	51911	I	1543	“ Lukas bet against me ? ”
51916	51920	51911	51911	I	1543	“ How rude . ”
51921	51936	51937	51937	Lia	1543	“ In all fairness , he bet against Julian ’s ability to feel things , ”
51940	51983	51937	51937	Lia	1543	“ That guy . I swear he never has girlfriends . He never even talks about flings or one - night stands , so we ’re not even fully sure that he has them . He ’s just so crazy about work . ”
51984	52001	51911	51911	I	1543	“ Yeah , well … we ’ll see if this thing between us lasts past work . ”
52002	52009	52010	52010	Lia	1543	“ What are you talking about ? ”
52021	52041	52042	52042	I	1543	“ I do n’t know , Lia , nor do I really want to get into it right now , ”
52053	52099	52042	52042	I	1543	“ My contract lasts three months or however long the Roth negotiations take . After that , I have trouble imagining that Julian is going to think much about me if I ’m not at his office and in front of his face every day . ”
52100	52107	52042	52042	I	1543	“ You do n’t know that . ”
52108	52131	52132	52132	I	1543	“ No , I do n’t know anything for sure , but I do know what the most realistic turnout would be , ”
52151	52158	52159	52159	Lia	1543	“ And what would that be ? ”
52174	52277	52167	52167	I	1543	“ That even if Julian Hoult did feel some tiny fraction of a thing for me , he would probably be really good at forcing himself to forget it if he had to . I mean look at who he is , where he ’s gotten himself . I ’m a workaholic , but he ’s a machine , and a month - long whirlwind is n’t going to affect a machine . It ’s just going to bounce off of him because he ’s made of steel . That ’s what it takes to run an empire like his . Right ? ”
52302	52307	52308	52308	she	1543	“ Jesus , girl , ”
52311	52318	52308	52308	she	1543	“ That ’s not the attitude . ”
52326	52349	52319	52319	I	1543	“ Sorry . I just want to be a big girl about it now , so it does n’t hurt me later . ”
52350	52355	52356	52356	she	1543	“ I get it , ”
52363	52374	52375	52375	She	1543	“ You know I totally get that . I just … ”
52386	52405	52406	52406	she	1543	“ I would n’t have snagged Lukas without you pushing me and being the little troublemaker you were , ”
52409	52471	52406	52406	she	1543	“ Sometimes I think about what might have slipped through my fingers if you did n’t force me to woman up and just go for it with him . He ’s the best thing that ’s ever happened to me , and after all the shit you ’ve been through , I just want the best thing to happen to you . ”
52472	52477	52478	52478	I	1543	“ Daw . Lia . ”
52494	52499	52500	52500	I	1543	“ I appreciate that , ”
52510	52513	52503	52503	she	1543	“ sorry , ”
52529	52551	52526	52526	I	1543	“ But hey , have you ever considered that maybe you ’re the best thing that ’s ever happened to me ? ”
52552	52561	52562	52562	she	1543	“ Oh , I agree wholeheartedly I am , ”
52569	52594	52562	52562	she	1543	“ But I ’m the best thing in a different category . There ’s a few . Social life , love life and career . ”
52595	52603	52604	52604	I	1543	“ Jesus , you have it all , ”
52607	52612	52604	52604	I	1543	“ You dirty whore . ”
52613	52637	52562	52562	she	1543	“ Ha ! Is this a bad time to say that Lukas is texting and wants us to leave now for the Hamptons ? ”
52638	52657	52658	52658	I	1543	“ No , it ’s not a bad time , because I ’m thoroughly done talking to you , ”
52672	52687	52658	52658	I	1543	“ Go furnish that beautiful beach house of yours , you domestic little thing . ”
52688	52709	52562	52562	she	1543	“ Are you sure you do n’t want to come with ? I can tell Lukas to wait till five . ”
52710	52742	52658	52658	I	1543	“ Absolutely not . You ’d hit rush hour . Also , I ’d puke out the window within the first two minutes of watching you two googly eye each other . ”
52743	52751	52752	52752	Lia	1543	“ We do get pretty gross sometimes , ”
52758	52781	52782	52782	she	1543	“ Alright , woman . Then enjoy your Friday and the rest of your weekend without being a Negative Nancy , alright ? ”
52792	52810	52811	52811	She	1543	“ No overanalyzing things while I ’m not here to talk it out with you . Just … ”
52822	52827	52811	52811	She	1543	“ Enjoy the now . ”
52828	52844	52811	52811	She	1543	“ I ’ll enjoy the now even more if you get out of here already . ”
52845	52852	52853	52853	Lia	1543	“ Rude . Hug me goodbye ! ”
52953	52965	52966	52966	Colin	95	“ Wow . Weather ’s gon na be nice this weekend , ”
52983	52987	52988	52988	he	95	“ Any plans ? ”
52991	52996	52997	52997	I	1543	“ Actually , no , ”
53005	53012	52966	52966	Colin	95	“ Aw man . Why not ? ”
53016	53054	53055	53055	I	1543	“ Probably because I ’m still not used to having weekends . I worked at least six days a week at my last job , and if I had Sundays off , it was strictly for decompressing , ”
53068	53111	53055	53055	I	1543	“ Also , now that I actually have some free time , my best friend is the one who ’s always busy . She and her boyfriend just bought a house out in the Hamptons , so they ’re always out there . ”
53112	53118	53119	53119	Colin	95	“ Wow ! Very nice , ”
53128	53146	53119	53119	Colin	95	“ On the bright side , we get to go to sunny Biarritz , France on Monday . ”
53147	53175	53055	53055	I	1543	“ Yes ! God , it came up so fast . I really ca n’t wait . I have n’t been out of the country in ages . ”
53176	53203	53119	53119	Colin	95	“ Well , you ’ll love it there . And Julian ’s pretty cool about giving employees time to explore when they ’re on business trips . ”
53204	53207	53208	53208	I	1543	“ Yeah ? ”
53211	53218	53208	53208	I	1543	“ That ’s nice of him . ”
53219	53236	53055	53055	I	1543	“ Yeah , he ’s a great boss . Ca n’t really beat working for him . ”
53293	53302	53303	53303	Colin	95	“ Alright , Sara , enjoy your weekend ! ”
53315	53319	53320	53320	I	1543	“ You too ! ”
53540	53544	53545	53545	Julian	88	“ Hi there , ”
53556	53559	53560	53560	I	1543	“ Hi , ”
53643	53649	53650	53650	Julian	88	“ How was your day ? ”
53653	53656	53657	53657	I	1543	“ Good , ”
53670	53679	53657	53657	I	1543	“ And how was yours , Mr. Hoult ? ”
53680	53685	53686	53686	Julian	88	“ Good as well , ”
53692	53698	53699	53699	I	1543	“ Glad to hear it , ”
53735	53742	53730	53730	Julian	88	“ Do you have plans tonight ? ”
53750	53755	53756	53756	I	1543	“ Not at all , ”
53769	53776	53778	53778	JULIAN	88	“ Good . Then get in . ”
53815	53831	53832	53832	she	240	“ Julian … I do n’t even know how to react to this right now , ”
53913	53928	53905	53905	her	240	“ You look like you ’re on your first field trip to the museum . ”
53929	53940	53897	53897	she	240	“ Quiet . You realize this is amazing , right ? ”
53941	53947	53948	53948	I	1543	“ I do enjoy it . ”
53963	53999	53956	53956	I	1543	“ I also enjoy how you ’ve paid no attention to the cars thus far . They were more of what I had in mind when I asked you to pick our ride for tonight . ”
54000	54006	54007	54007	Sara	240	“ But I want this , ”
54030	54047	54007	54007	Sara	240	“ Why do we have to take a car ? Look how beautiful this thing is . ”
54048	54080	54081	54081	I	1543	“ While you have impeccable taste , that ’s an F131 Hellcat Combat , and it has no passenger seat , so I promise you , we ’re not taking that , ”
54100	54117	54118	54118	she	240	“ Hm . Something tells me you ride motorcycles for the express purpose of being alone , ”
54134	54144	54145	54145	she	240	“ Uh - oh . Look what I found , ”
54173	54181	54164	54164	she	240	“ Looks like we have a winner . ”
54182	54196	54197	54197	She	240	“ Sara . I ’d prefer something with doors . And seat belts . ”
54213	54221	54222	54222	she	240	“ Why ? You ride these things , ”
54226	54232	54197	54197	She	240	“ Yes . I do . ”
54233	54253	54203	54203	she	240	“ Well , if you ’re not worried about your safety , then no need to worry about mine . ”
54254	54264	54265	54265	I	1543	“ We ’ve established I have difficulty with this , ”
54298	54303	54304	54304	she	240	“ Oh . Norton , ”
54309	54314	54289	54289	she	240	“ You know it ? ”
54315	54331	54332	54332	she	240	“ Not really . It ’s just my dad had a Norton belt growing up , ”
54341	54352	54332	54332	she	240	“ It had this logo and a little British flag . ”
54353	54359	54289	54289	she	240	“ He had a bike ? ”
54360	54378	54332	54332	she	240	“ Definitely not , but he was British . Still is , as far as I know . ”
54395	54409	54289	54289	she	240	“ Not sure why I did n’t expect your parents to be Brits . ”
54410	54439	54440	54440	she	240	“ They ’re not . Just Dad . Mom is from a tiny , tiny , mountain village that Dad was photographing many years ago during his travels , ”
54477	54484	54485	54485	I	1543	“ Was your dad a photographer ? ”
54488	54493	54494	54494	she	240	“ Not at all , ”
54497	54585	54494	54494	she	240	“ He was an eighteen - year - old gap year backpacker when he met my poor , unsuspecting mom . She says she did n’t like him at all the first summer they met . He was loud and excitable and a little overwhelming . But despite how young he was , he said she was ‘ too pretty to just forget , ’ so he kept visiting her summer after summer till she started finding his quirks charming enough to move to London with him . ”
54586	54593	54475	54475	herself	240	“ That ’s some serious persistency . ”
54594	54640	54494	54494	she	240	“ Yeah , my dad is … whimsical , as he likes to say . He ’s a lawyer who loves his colorful socks and chatting anyone ’s ear off . Says ‘ he ’s never met a stranger . ’ He ’s that guy . ”
54641	54653	54475	54475	herself	240	“ Mm . Yeah , I ’m familiar with that guy . ”
54654	54659	54660	54660	Sara	240	“ Oh , yeah , ”
54672	54705	54660	54660	Sara	240	“ Meanwhile , my mom trusts no one in this world . Except him . You ’ll never see her admit it , because she ’s as ridiculously stoic as you are , ”
54714	54740	54706	54706	Sara	240	“ but she still finds my dad to be so very charming and ‘ unbearably funny , ’ as she says . It ’s cute . ”
54741	54747	54748	54748	I	1543	“ Sounds like my parents , ”
54751	54756	54706	54706	Sara	240	“ Forever in love ? ”
54757	54760	54706	54706	Sara	240	“ Yes . ”
54767	54775	54761	54761	Sara	240	“ That ’s the way to be . ”
54776	54790	54706	54706	Sara	240	“ So I hear . You ’re in heels , by the way . ”
54791	54794	54761	54761	Sara	240	“ What ? ”
54795	54807	54706	54706	Sara	240	“ You ’re not exactly dressed to ride a motorcycle tonight . ”
54819	54832	54761	54761	Sara	240	“ Oh . I have a change of shoes in my purse . ”
54833	54836	54761	54761	Sara	240	“ Seriously ? ”
54837	54861	54761	54761	Sara	240	“ Yes . Any girl in heels who ’s carrying a big purse has flats or sneakers in it . I guarantee you . ”
54866	54879	54862	54862	I	1543	“ Your pencil skirt does n’t lend well to mounting a bike . ”
54880	54889	54761	54761	Sara	240	“ I ’ve mounted you in this skirt . ”
54896	54935	54936	54936	I	1543	“ Listen , everything you ’re doing on that bike right now is already going straight to my cock , so for the sake of getting to our plans on time , do n’t talk about mounting me , ”
54947	54962	54936	54936	I	1543	“ Tell me why you ’re hell - bent on taking the bike tonight . ”
54963	54984	54985	54985	Sara	240	“ Because you said you ’re choosing where we go , so I get to choose how we get there , ”
54989	55009	55010	55010	she	240	“ And I choose this . Also , I ’ve kind of been obsessed with motorcycles since high school , ”
55014	55018	55010	55010	she	240	“ Also unexpected . ”
55019	55034	55035	55035	she	240	“ Yeah , well , I fantasized in great detail about escaping that place , ”
55056	55061	55035	55035	she	240	“ Escaping what place ? ”
55067	55084	55085	55085	she	240	“ Save for speedboats , motorcycles are also the coolest form of getaway in heist movies , ”
55094	55131	55085	55085	she	240	“ So , a hundred percent , we ’re taking this bike . And if you ’re concerned about it being my first ride , it ’s not . So , done . It ’s decided . ”
55139	55204	55205	55205	Sara	240	“ Fine . But you ’re wearing a helmet , and I ’m going to teach you the proper way to mount and ride as a passenger . Most importantly , when I lean , you lean . Do n’t try to balance me by going the opposite way . Even if you feel like we ’re about to fall , which you will . ”
55212	55223	55224	55224	she	240	“ Are you trying to scare me out of this ? ”
55230	55239	55205	55205	Sara	240	“ Somewhat . Last chance to back out . ”
55240	55243	55244	55244	she	240	“ Never , ”
55248	55259	55260	55260	I	1543	“ You do n’t even know where we ’re going , ”
55274	55281	55266	55266	she	240	“ What difference does that make ? ”
56208	56212	56213	56213	I	1543	“ Good Lord , ”
56259	56268	56269	56274	one of the sun hat ladies	876	“ Oh , honey , is he yours ? ”
56285	56300	56301	56301	she	876	“ Oh , yes , you match too well not to be with him , ”
56304	56314	56315	56315	I	1543	“ Yes , I guess he is mine today , ”
56338	56360	56361	56361	she	876	“ Ah , ah – just today ? Oh , no , no , dear . That is not the attitude , ”
56413	56416	56417	56417	He	1543	“ Hey . ”
56457	56463	56452	56452	he	1543	“ How does it feel ? ”
56482	56488	56489	56489	I	1543	“ You mean the ride ? ”
56502	56512	56489	56489	I	1543	“ It ’s good . Not bad at all . ”
56513	56523	56489	56489	I	1543	“ When else have you been on a motorcycle ? ”
56534	56542	56543	56543	I	1543	“ With my best friend in college , ”
56579	56585	56586	56586	I	1543	“ Should we get going ? ”
56642	56646	56647	56647	he	1543	“ Good girl , ”
56736	56739	56740	56740	I	1543	“ Ridiculous , ”
56750	56754	56755	56755	he	355	“ I agree , ”
56861	56870	56871	56871	Lia	1543	“ Oh my God ! I knew it ! ”
56888	56899	56900	56900	she	1543	“ Hi , hi , hi , hi , hi ! ”
56941	56946	56947	56947	I	1543	“ Hey , crazy , ”
56967	56985	56956	56956	She	1543	“ You ! You could ’ve told Lukas you were bringing her so I had some warning ! ”
56986	56992	56993	56993	Julian	1543	“ I did tell Lukas , ”
57011	57014	57006	57006	she	1543	“ Lukas ! ”
57055	57076	57045	57045	he	1543	“ It ’s hard to believe stories that she was ever anything resembling a calm or mild - mannered person . ”
57082	57091	57077	57077	I	1543	“ She really was pretty reserved for awhile . ”
57092	57099	57045	57045	he	1543	“ I ca n’t imagine it . ”
57100	57104	57105	57105	I	1543	“ I swear , ”
57119	57156	57105	57105	I	1543	“ She ’s from a small , shitty town like me , and that place did a number on her for awhile , so I think when Lukas came around , that was the turning point . ”
57157	57167	57168	57168	Julian	1543	“ You ’re from a small , shitty town ? ”
57174	57177	57168	57168	Julian	1543	“ Where ? ”
57212	57240	57193	57193	My	1543	“ You know , it ’s every bit like you to weed out anything I say about Lia , and just listen to the part about me . ”
57241	57258	57193	57193	My	1543	“ Yes . I do n’t like her . I like you . Is that surprising ? ”
57274	57334	57193	57193	My	1543	“ Do n’t you dare say you do n’t like my best friend , Julian . I mean it . Especially when I know you do like her as a human being . If you ’re Lukas ’s friend , you have to . It ’s not like she did n’t do worlds of good for him , too . ”
57335	57338	57402	57402	his	1543	“ Fair . ”
57339	57347	57193	57193	My	1543	“ Say one nice thing about Lia . ”
57348	57363	57402	57402	his	1543	“ She has the good sense to associate with people like Lukas and yourself . ”
57364	57370	57371	57371	I	1543	“ That does n’t count ! ”
57408	57421	57422	57422	he	1543	“ I like how you look when you get defensive of her , ”
57429	57435	57436	57436	I	1543	“ Still does n’t count , ”
57504	57513	57488	57488	I	1543	“ Oh shit ! Look who it is ! ”
57853	57865	57833	57833	He	319	“ Nice to meet you . Julian has spoken about you . ”
57875	57878	57866	57866	He	319	“ What ? ”
57890	57900	57880	57880	Julian	1543	“ What ? I did n’t say anything weird ! ”
57946	57954	57955	57955	Julian	1543	“ You guys have a nice introduction ? ”
57974	57993	57994	57994	Emmett	319	“ We had a perfectly normal introduction , during which I revealed no more information than was necessary , ”
58011	58028	57999	57999	He	319	“ Sometimes I talk like him so he ’ll understand what the hell I ’m saying . ”
58029	58039	58040	58040	Julian	1543	“ I still do n’t understand him for shit , ”
58138	58153	58154	58154	she	1543	“ Oh my God , he ’s being so un - Julian right now , ”
58165	58174	58154	58154	she	1543	“ He ’s definitely being … super cute . ”
58175	58216	58154	58154	she	1543	“ And that is definitely the first time ‘ cute ’ has ever been used to describe Julian Hoult . Pretty sure even when he was a baby , his mom called him ‘ handsome ’ and ‘ efficient . ’ ”
58251	58270	58271	58271	Lia	1543	“ Like that . That just now ? You guys are acting like a couple or some shit , ”
58274	58298	58271	58271	Lia	1543	“ Sara , I swear to God , I am presently overwhelmed with the possibilities of our summer if you start dating Julian . ”
58299	58309	58310	58310	I	1543	“ Oh my God , will you cool it ? ”
58313	58326	58310	58310	I	1543	“ Can I take this a day at a time , please ? ”
58327	58360	58271	58271	Lia	1543	“ That ’s what normal people who practice caution say . You ’re not that person anymore . You just did two hours on the road as your first motorcycle ride ever . ”
58361	58381	58310	58310	I	1543	“ To be fair , I ’ve ridden the back of a motorcycle around an empty parking lot before . ”
58382	58388	58389	58389	Lia	1543	“ Yeah . Totally comparable , ”
58439	58446	58447	58447	I	1543	“ Sorry , what ’s happening ? ”
58464	58491	58492	58492	he	319	“ I was just saying how I invested in this place because I did post - prom in Southampton after high school , and these assholes , ”
58499	58522	58492	58492	he	319	“ are telling me post - prom in the Hamptons is ridiculous , so I wanna know what everyone did for theirs . ”
58523	58528	58529	58529	I	1543	“ Post - prom ? ”
58549	58556	58535	58535	I	1543	“ Um , in my town … ”
58566	58603	58559	58559	My	1543	“ People went to party venues for the ‘ after prom party , ’ and it was adult supervised , but I know that they were able to still get away with bringing alcohol and stuff . ”
58604	58615	58635	58635	She	161	“ You do n’t sound like you went to it , ”
58652	58660	58661	58661	I	1543	“ Yeah , I did n’t go , ”
58664	58668	58661	58661	I	1543	“ Why not ? ”
58669	58672	58635	58635	She	161	“ Um . ”
58745	58754	58755	58755	I	1543	“ I graduated high school a year early , ”
58780	58802	58803	58803	she	161	“ So you were a little younger your senior year . That does n’t mean you ’re not allowed at prom , ”
58823	58829	58830	58830	I	1543	“ Yeah , I just … ”
58850	58868	58869	58869	Julian	88	“ Emmett , why do n’t you tell everyone about the fire you started at your prom ? ”
58885	58896	58897	58898	some guy	905	“ You started a fire at your prom , E ? ”
58901	58906	58907	58907	Julian	88	“ You ’re surprised ? ”
58910	58917	58918	58918	Lukas	355	“ I for one am not , ”
58921	58932	58918	58918	Lukas	355	“ But I definitely need to hear the story now . ”
59009	59017	59018	59018	I	1543	“ Lia , who is that woman ? ”
59042	59055	59018	59018	I	1543	“ The one in the green who grilled me about my prom . ”
59056	59102	59018	59018	I	1543	“ I do n’t know , but trust me , I was asking Lukas the same question after she pulled that I’m - so - curious shit . Like , could n’t she see that you did n’t want to talk about it ? Jesus . ”
59103	59116	59117	59117	I	1543	“ What did Lukas say ? Does he know who she is ? ”
59120	59123	59124	59124	Lia	1543	“ No . ”
59131	59159	59124	59124	Lia	1543	“ I swear there ’s so much even he does n’t know about Julian , and he ’s by far the closest to Julian outside of family . ”
59227	59234	59235	59235	I	1543	“ So , Emmett ’s funny , ”
59242	59249	59250	59250	Lia	1543	“ Yeah , he ’s crazy , ”
59253	59277	59250	59250	Lia	1543	“ And a party animal . Give him another few hours , he ’ll turn this kumbaya into a full - on rager . ”
59278	59287	59288	59288	I	1543	“ Oh God . Looking forward to it , ”
59302	59308	59309	59309	Lia	1543	“ Oh , come on , ”
59345	59378	59334	59334	I	1543	“ It ’s okay . No biggie . That ’s probably fair game when people leave their seats for the bathroom . It is n’t war unless they refuse to get up . ”
59388	59391	59392	59392	she	161	“ Oh , ”
59418	59445	59446	59446	she	161	“ Can we exchange for a bit ? I just need to catch up with this man . It ’s been way , way too long , ”
59482	59488	59489	59489	he	88	“ Sara , come here , ”
59508	59513	59514	59514	Lia	1543	“ Oh my God , ”
59601	59605	59596	59596	he	88	“ Stop that . ”
59606	59610	59611	59611	I	1543	“ Stop what ? ”
59615	59646	59596	59596	he	88	“ Clenching your pussy . I can feel it on my thighs , and I ’d rather not get any harder than I currently am in front of these people . ”
59676	59684	59685	59685	she	161	“ So , you rode pillion today , ”
59688	59691	59692	59692	I	1543	“ Pillion ? ”
59710	59719	59695	59695	She	161	“ That means the passenger seat , sweetie . ”
59736	59738	59731	59731	her	161	“ sweetie ”
59751	59767	59768	59768	I	1543	“ Oh . Well , in that case , yes . I did ride pillion , ”
59780	59798	59799	59799	Pixie	161	“ I ’m a bit surprised you would take someone inexperienced for a two - hour ride , ”
59804	59814	59799	59799	Pixie	161	“ You ’re usually so big on following rules . ”
59815	59820	59821	59821	Julian	88	“ Yes , well . ”
59841	59848	59821	59821	Julian	88	“ She can be very persuasive . ”
59900	59907	59908	59908	Emmett	319	“ What ’s up , Giggles ? ”
59911	59934	59941	59941	she	1543	“ Oh , nothing . I just overheard Julian calling Sara ‘ very persuasive , ’ and I just had to agree . ”
59954	59990	59941	59941	she	1543	“ She is unrivaled when it comes to making people do things . Right , Lukas ? Let ’s not forget that this bad bitch over here is the reason you and I got together . ”
60002	60012	60013	60013	he	355	“ I do owe you a big thank you , ”
60016	60048	60049	60049	he	355	“ Thank you for meddling when I was courting this woman . You are the best , and any uptight billionaire assholes in this vicinity would be lucky to have you , ”
60071	60089	60090	60090	she	1543	“ Did everyone hear that ? Sara is the best , so do n’t fuck with her , ”
60109	60118	60119	60119	Emmett	319	“ Yeah , she ’s fuckin ’ Superwoman , ”
60123	60141	60119	60119	Emmett	319	“ Pretty sure no one else could ’ve trapped those Roth assholes as fast as you did . ”
60160	60163	60164	60164	Julian	88	“ Emmett , ”
60494	60505	60506	60506	Pixie	161	“ So , wait , I do n’t get it . ”
60515	60526	60506	60506	Pixie	161	“ You ’re like … an escort for these men ? ”
60542	60548	60549	60549	She	161	“ Wow , that ’s … ”
60561	60564	60549	60549	She	161	“ Yikes . ”
60646	60649	60628	60628	her	161	“ Sara . ”
60650	60660	60661	60661	I	1543	“ I do n’t want to talk to you , ”
60667	60671	60661	60661	I	1543	“ Or anyone . ”
60672	60691	60692	60692	he	355	“ My brother is a fucking idiot , Sara , I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry , ”
60719	60727	60712	60712	I	1543	“ Please let me talk to you . ”
60728	60745	60746	60746	I	1543	“ I do n’t want to be here right now , Julian , I feel disgusting , ”
60749	60774	60775	60775	I	1543	“ I feel so dirty and disgusting right now . Those guys – they were looking at me like I was some kind of … ”
60991	61001	61002	61002	Julian	88	“ Come on . You ’re coming with me . ”
61246	61254	61255	61255	Sara	240	“ You really need to know this ? ”
61328	61334	61335	61335	I	1543	“ I need to know , ”
61358	61392	61349	61349	she	939	“ I do n’t enjoy feeling like I ca n’t protect you . The more you tell me , the better I know how to keep someone from hurting you . So talk . ”
61393	61406	61407	61407	she	939	“ You first . Who was that woman in the green dress ? ”
61415	61425	61407	61407	she	939	“ She seemed a bit possessive of your attention . ”
61426	61431	61432	61432	I	1543	“ That was Madeline , ”
61435	61469	61432	61432	I	1543	“ I met her five years ago while I was out with Emmett one night . I do n’t know where he found her . He generally collects new friends throughout the night . ”
61470	61478	61479	61479	she	939	“ And you two have slept together ? ”
61482	61485	61486	61486	I	1543	“ Twice , ”
61489	61546	61486	61486	I	1543	“ She ’s just a woman I ’ve slept with before , Sara . Your issue with her should be solely with the fact that she crossed the line in conversation today . You have no reason to feel threatened by any woman I ’ve had a history with , no matter how long or brief . ”
61547	61555	61556	61556	Sara	240	“ No ? Tell me why not , ”
61586	61606	61559	61559	Her	240	“ I care about you more than I ’ve ever cared about another woman . That ’s your answer . ”
61607	61614	61615	61615	she	240	“ That ’s hard to believe , ”
61639	61642	61643	61643	I	1543	“ Why ? ”
61646	61661	61643	61643	I	1543	“ What reason have I given you to doubt that I care for you ? ”
61662	61665	61666	61666	she	240	“ None , ”
61670	61686	61687	61687	she	240	“ I just do n’t know you . I do n’t know anything about you , ”
61704	61787	61698	61698	her	240	“ I ’m obviously feeling things for you . You do n’t make it easy for me to avoid that , but I want to keep myself at least a little protected from you . Explaining my past to you is just me volunteering to knock down whatever ’s left of my wall , and I do n’t know if that ’s worth it for you , Julian . Not when this little thing here will be done before I know it . ”
61809	61818	61819	61819	I	1543	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
61830	61854	61855	61855	she	240	“ Are you really going to pretend whatever ’s going on between us is something you ’re willing to invest your time in ? ”
61858	61964	61855	61855	she	240	“ Look at you . Look at who you are . You do n’t do this kind of thing . You do n’t have girlfriends . There ’s a good portion of your life you have n’t revealed to your own best friend . You ’re guarded , and I get it . It ’s the best way to get work done . We ’ve both employed that method of living . We both know what it ’s like , so why are you asking me to expose myself for you when you ’d never do the same for anyone else , let alone me ? ”
62020	62039	62052	62052	she	945	“ I ’ll tell you whatever you want to know about me if you tell me about you . ”
62058	62077	62078	62078	she	945	“ You wo n’t want to look at me let alone talk to me after I ’m done , ”
62101	62128	62052	62052	she	945	“ You know that is n’t true . I ca n’t stop looking at you . That ’s been the problem since the night we met . ”
62141	62221	62222	62222	she	945	“ Fine . If you ’re so convinced of that , let me go right ahead . I stayed at June Magazine for almost ten years , despite how they treated me , because I was convinced no other company would ever hire me . My mom was convinced June neglected my background check because I was hired directly out of my internship . I was arrested in college , Julian . Can you guess what the charges were ? ”
62245	62257	62258	62258	she	945	“ It was prostitution . Would you like to run now ? ”
62420	62425	62426	62426	I	1543	“ Look at me , ”
62477	62561	62466	62466	I	1543	“ Look at me , Sara . You see me . You know I ’m not going anywhere . I ’m right here , and all I want is to know that I can fix the way you feel . I ca n’t stand it when you ’re unhappy , and I ’m going to have you smiling by the end of this night , I promise you that . I just need you to talk to me first , Sara . Please . ”
62609	62623	62603	62603	she	947	“ The scar I have ... you know what I ’m talking about . ”
62624	62635	62636	62636	I	1543	“ The one Turner mentioned the night at the pool , ”
62639	62658	62636	62636	I	1543	“ That one . You saw it when you were helping me come down from my panic attack . ”
62659	62662	62636	62636	I	1543	“ Yes . ”
62663	62701	62636	62636	I	1543	“ I usually have it covered with makeup . It ’s in the shape of an ‘ F ’ because the girls at school wanted to burn the word ‘ freak ’ on me with their cigarettes . ”
62781	62786	62787	62787	I	1543	“ You were bullied ? ”
62790	62801	62802	62802	she	948	“ From the start . But what did I expect , ”
62812	62947	62948	62948	She	949	“ My dad … he moved us to Texas on a whim . After his mom died , he wanted to leave London , and he picked this little town where one of his travel buddies from forever ago lived . I was already different when we got there – I looked different . I talked different . My dad had an accent , my mom was too nervous to speak to other moms . I was an easy target . But it got so much worse when my dad decided to represent his friend in an assault case . Some bar fight . The defendant was popular around town – he was the high school football coach , and he had a kid in my grade . Also well liked . Also popular . ”
62957	62980	62948	62948	She	949	“ So everyone made my life miserable from that point on . And it got that much worse after my dad won . ”
63012	63016	63017	63017	I	1543	“ Go on , ”
63050	63063	63064	63064	she	949	“ It took a couple days for them to finish the F , ”
63067	63130	63131	63131	She	949	“ The girls would corner me in the bathroom . One time , they even snuck some boys in to keep me restrained while they burned me . I remembered crying , but I did n’t make a sound because I felt like that was validation for them . I was just thinking of how to get myself out of the place . ”
63136	63278	63131	63131	She	949	“ I fantasized about getaways a lot . That ’s where the motorcycle thing came in . But that was n’t realistic , obviously , so I just worked to graduate early and start completely anew in college . I already knew where I wanted to go that we could afford , and I knew what sorority I wanted to join . I knew how I would dress and act so I did n’t seem different again , like an outcast again . I had dreamt of going to prom since I was a little girl , and wearing that big , poufy dress . But since that clearly was n’t going to happen , I told myself I ’d go to frat parties , and mixers , and I ’d have that perfect all - American teen life in college . ”
63279	63283	63284	63284	I	1543	“ Did you ? ”
63317	63334	63309	63309	she	952	“ You said you rode the back of a motorcycle with your best friend in college . ”
63335	63338	63339	63339	Sara	240	“ Ashleigh , ”
63354	63527	63339	63339	Sara	240	“ Ash is what we called her . She was my big . I got into the sorority I wanted , I got all the friends I wanted , and I got her as my big sister , which seemed like winning the jackpot at the time . She was this insanely popular , Barbie - like girl who everyone adored on campus , and the fact that she took me under her wing was like a dream . We were inseparable from the second we met , and suddenly , just a summer after all that torture in high school , I had everything I ever wanted . I had this built in family with my sisters , and I had this girl who would drive me around , take me out , be a shoulder to cry on . I was seventeen , and she was like a god to me . She had me wrapped around her pinky so hard I did n’t question anything she asked of me . ”
63565	63573	63556	63556	her	240	“ What did she ask of you ? ”
63574	63579	63580	63580	She	240	“ She had me … ”
63586	63593	63594	63594	she	240	“ She had me perform favors , ”
63609	63716	63594	63594	she	240	“ For guys in the frat we were paired with . I knew I did n’t feel right , but I did n’t really understand what was happening . I was so desperate to believe these girls were my friends . I did n’t have coffee dates , or sleepovers , or parties back in high school , and I had all of that with these girls . They helped me study , they met me after class , they defended me to the death if anyone was even a little rude to me at a party . So I was so confused . I was … ”
63726	63731	63717	63717	Sara	240	“ So fucking stupid . ”
63732	63737	63738	63738	I	1543	“ You were seventeen , ”
63745	63789	63738	63738	I	1543	“ The kids in high school , they were blatant villains . You knew to run from them . But these girls were different . They acted like friends to play into your vulnerability , and what they did to you was heinous . ”
63790	63799	63800	63800	Sara	240	“ That was n’t even the worst part , ”
63809	63888	63800	63800	Sara	240	“ Ash convinced me she needed money . Something about her family being in trouble . She reminded me of all the times she drove me , or paid for me , or did whatever for me . And she guilted me into saying yes to something disgusting , because she said I ’d be screwed if I did n’t do it . That college could be as bad as it was in high school . Worse maybe . ”
63908	63917	63918	63918	I	1543	“ It ’s okay . Take your time , ”
63939	64019	64020	64020	She	955	“ They found someone – some man who would pay a lot of money to sleep with me . They told me he was one of our friend ’s older cousins , but when I got to the motel , the man was so much older , and from somewhere else . He said he found Ash online . I remember feeling so betrayed , and I remember how annoyed he got that I cried in front of him . ”
64069	64087	64061	64061	she	955	“ I need you to know that I did n’t have sex with that man . Okay ? ”
64088	64091	64092	64092	I	1543	“ Okay , ”
64095	64102	64092	64092	I	1543	“ It ’s okay , Sara . ”
64103	64225	64061	64061	she	955	“ One of my sisters called the cops . I told her before we left about what Ash and the other older girls were asking me to do , and I begged her to call the cops . I did n’t think she would , but she did . I felt so disgusting for being naked when they found me . I had already tried touching that man . It honestly felt like the cops came at the last possible second . But I thank God for them anyway , and I thank God for the girl who called them for me . I was n’t even mad at her for being like everyone else and ignoring me after the incident . ”
64226	64233	64092	64092	I	1543	“ Because you called the cops ? ”
64234	64411	64061	64061	she	955	“ Yes . Ash and the girls were arrested . Their names were in the paper , and mine got taken out when they realized I was a minor . They dropped the charges on me when they realized what was happening , and the kids at school thought that was unfair . They blamed me for everything – said I was asking for it with the way I dressed , the way I wore makeup . They had already saved the article that came out with my name in it . It ’s still archived online . I tried to have it taken down , but someone put it back up , even after I transferred thousands of miles away . And it just feels like this nagging reminder that I was once this … little thing that existed solely for sex . It makes me feel dirty and disgusting and guilty for wanting sex . Especially the way that I want it . A part of me feels like I should be repenting still . ”
64412	64428	64429	64429	I	1543	“ Do you feel guilty about what we ’ve done in the past few weeks ? ”
64476	64479	64480	64480	she	956	“ No , ”
64518	64621	64514	64514	she	956	“ All I feel is good around you . I feel like I ’m doing something a little wilder and crazier than I ’m used to , but I do n’t ever feel bad about it . Not with you . I do n’t feel guilty about anything between us , and it makes me feel like I ’m actually free around you . Like I ’m really acting like myself instead of the girl I forced myself to be . I was just trying to make it up to myself and my parents for what I did when I was seventeen . ”
64622	64666	64505	64505	her	956	“ That was ten years ago , Sara . It was n’t your fault , nor should you feel guilty about what you want . You ’re not defined by what those girls did to you . You ca n’t keep blaming yourself . ”
64667	64680	64681	64681	she	959	“ I pushed it to the back of my head for awhile , ”
64685	64761	64681	64681	she	959	“ I did n’t even think about it much while I was at June Magazine . I was so overworked , but I think I liked it . I was always exhausted , too busy to do too much drinking , definitely no dating , and it made me feel like I had successfully transformed into someone new . Someone not filthy and reckless . My mother was proud of me . Everything seemed okay . ”
64762	64767	64854	64854	She	959	“ Until you quit . ”
64768	64771	64772	64772	Her	959	“ Yes . ”
64786	64853	64772	64772	Her	959	“ I took your job offer because I wanted to be near you . I ’m not even going to lie about it at this point . But since I ’ve started , I ’ve felt just … better about myself . Like I ’m allowed to enjoy the things I used to feel guilty about , and like I ’m the one in control now . ”
64883	64891	64892	64892	she	959	“ You make me feel … happy , ”
64898	64909	64910	64910	she	959	“ Like I ’ve never felt before in my life , ”
64922	64970	64915	64915	she	959	“ And I know that ’s a lot for you to hear right now , so you do n’t have to say anything . Just nod or say one word to acknowledge you heard it , and we ’ll move on . Just say ‘ okay . ’ ”
64971	64978	64979	64979	I	1543	“ How about ‘ same ’ ? ”
64989	64995	64982	64982	she	959	“ I feel the same . ”
65009	65020	65021	65021	I	1543	“ But I want to make sure you stay happy , ”
65029	65048	65021	65021	I	1543	“ I ’m not going to let anyone hurt you again . I promise you that . Okay ? ”
65062	65065	65067	65067	SARA	240	“ Okay . ”
65832	65847	65813	65813	Julian	88	“ I care about you more than I ’ve ever cared about another woman . ”
65941	65944	65945	65945	Julian	88	“ Morning . ”
65993	65996	65997	65997	I	1543	“ Morning , ”
66016	66025	66026	66026	I	1543	“ I thought it was for work purposes , ”
66033	66041	66026	66026	I	1543	“ I did n’t realize it was … ”
66042	66045	66046	66046	Julian	88	“ What ? ”
66050	66064	66065	66065	he	88	“ What is it that you think you ’re looking at right now ? ”
66071	66079	66026	66026	I	1543	“ Remnants of a very passionate affair . ”
66080	66083	66084	66084	He	88	“ No . ”
66090	66100	66084	66084	He	88	“ For the most part , you ’re wrong . ”
66101	66107	66108	66108	My	1543	“ For the most part ? ”
66138	66148	66149	66149	I	1543	“ Will you tell me the story behind it ? ”
66173	66176	66177	66177	he	88	“ Yes , ”
66180	66192	66177	66177	he	88	“ But we ’re going to need to get breakfast first . ”
66276	66305	66306	66306	I	1543	“ If this is your way of keeping me distracted while you confess your secrets , I do n’t appreciate it , because it ’s kind of working , ”
66380	66383	66384	66384	He	88	“ Actually . ”
66397	66408	66384	66384	He	88	“ The boat is for the purpose of distracting me . ”
66409	66412	66384	66384	He	88	“ Oh . ”
66482	66492	66493	66493	I	1543	“ How ’d you learn to drive a boat ? ”
66511	66517	66518	66518	He	88	“ My grandfather taught me . ”
66557	66563	66564	66564	I	1543	“ Your mother ’s father ? ”
66567	66617	66543	66543	I	1543	“ My father ’s father . He taught me how to steer a boat , how to line a fishing rod – he also taught all eight grandkids how to use our chest voices when heckling opposing outfielders . So we ’d be loud enough to actually distract them . ”
66656	66663	66543	66543	I	1543	“ Your grandfather sounds like fun . "
66664	66681	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ He was . He was also ‘ that guy . ’ Similar to your dad . ”
66692	66754	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ Yeah , he was loud and happy and animated . He asked my grandmother on a date about two minutes after he first spotted her at the stadium , and when he took her out that night , he told her he was going to marry her , have three kids with her , and buy the Empires for her . ”
66755	66760	66761	66761	I	1543	“ And he did ? ”
66764	66772	66761	66761	I	1543	“ I mean the three kids part . ”
66773	66830	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ Yes . That he got right . Same with the marriage part , obviously . He was a lower - middle class kid from Brooklyn , but he wound up making most of his money through property rentals , and he did try to buy the Empires twice before , but his bids were rejected . ”
66831	66850	66761	66761	I	1543	“ Oh no . Was your grandma holding him to the whole thing about buying her the team ? ”
66851	66888	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ Not at all . She teased him every day about how she did n’t believe he ’d ever be able to do it , and that he was batting six sixty - seven on promises . ”
66889	66897	66898	66898	I	1543	“ Lord . Such a baseball family , ”
66901	66916	66898	66898	I	1543	“ They sound too cute . Is your dad also ‘ that guy ? ’ ”
66917	66928	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ No , my dad would be more like me . ”
66929	66934	66898	66898	I	1543	“ Serious and scary ? ”
66938	66955	66935	66935	Julian	88	“ Yes , but less scary . A little nicer . No – a lot nicer . ”
66956	66964	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ Really ? Tell me about him . ”
66965	67033	66935	66935	Julian	88	“ Well , he did inherit some of my grandfather ’s romantic side . To the point that I grew up thinking all kids celebrated Mother ’s Day with the same fanfare as Thanksgiving and Christmas . We used to spend the entire month before the day planning her surprise . We would get all her favorite foods , decorate the entire house with her favorite flowers . ”
67034	67038	66682	66682	Julian	88	“ Which were ? ”
67039	67043	67044	67044	Julian	88	“ Ranunculus flowers , ”
67056	67067	67044	67044	Julian	88	“ The name is misleading . They ’re really beautiful . ”
67076	67084	67068	67068	I	1543	“ Huh . Julian Hoult likes flowers ? ”
67085	67105	67106	67106	he	88	“ Hard not to with the way I grew up . Every April of my life revolved around flowers , ”
67109	67169	67106	67106	he	88	“ Dahlias were also high on the list . Hydrangeas , too . Mom liked all the harder to find colors , so Emmett and I usually started ordering a month before Mother ’s Day . Dad was in charge of planning and executing the menu for the night , and Emmett and I were on ordering and décor . ”
67170	67180	67068	67068	I	1543	“ And by Emmett and you , you mean … ”
67181	67185	67186	67186	Julian	88	“ Just me , ”
67197	67246	67186	67186	Julian	88	“ There were these big , chocolate - covered strawberries that were Mom ’s favorite , and timing that order so they stayed fresh would always cause Emmett to melt down . There was always a point where he got overwhelmed and meditated by coloring and making cards . ”
67247	67255	67256	67256	I	1543	“ Oh , no ! Poor Emmett . ”
67303	67319	67296	67299	the Hoult Family Mother	987	“ So , is this where Julian Hoult ’s famous organizing and planning skills originated ? ”
67320	67381	67280	67281	baby Emmett	319	“ Possibly . Though my father did start me on business classes around middle school . He said all my grandfather ’s real estate was purchased on a whim , when property was cheap , so it was unreasonable to believe that his kind of success would just replicate or fall in our laps . We had to earn it . ”
67382	67396	67397	67397	I	1543	“ Ah . Now I see how you and Dad are more alike , ”
67427	67437	67525	67525	I	1543	“ I take it Emmett ’s more like Mom ? ”
67438	67476	67280	67281	baby Emmett	319	“ No , my mom is a good balance of fun and serious . Emmett would be more like my crazy grandfather . Not a surprise at all that he was always my grandparents ’ favorite grandchild . ”
67477	67485	67525	67525	I	1543	“ Really ? It was n’t you ? ”
67486	67493	67494	67494	Julian	88	“ I was a close second , ”
67497	67524	67494	67494	Julian	88	“ I was a bit fickle . I was n’t easy to amuse at all , and that just kills the fun of playing with kids . ”
67576	67586	67563	67563	he	88	“ So Emmett was the happy , smiley kid . ”
67587	67592	67593	67593	Julian	88	“ Shocking , right ? ”
67600	67681	67593	67593	Julian	88	“ I ’ll admit he was hilariously cute as a kid . Pretty much never stopped smiling – thought anything you said or did was fucking amazing . My grandpa used to bring him around the bleachers when Emmett was a toddler , and he ’d just introduce him to complete strangers . He just thought there was no chance someone at an Empires game would prefer to actually watch the game than meet this ‘ fine young gentleman . ’ ”
67682	67693	67694	67694	I	1543	“ Oh , God . That ’s actually too cute . ”
67737	67773	67718	67718	his	88	“ Meanwhile , my grandmother was glued to the game . She loved her grandkids , but if there was baseball going on , she was n’t taking her eyes off the field for anything . ”
67774	67807	67808	67808	I	1543	“ So , she came here from Germany , went straight to a game to get a feel of Americana , and then became the most hardcore baseball fan in your family ? ”
67814	67817	67818	67818	Julian	88	“ Absolutely , ”
67830	67902	67825	67826	The man	88	“ She likes to pull my President of Baseball Operations aside every once in awhile , and give her some pointers on who to sign during free agency . She ’s almost ninety now , but still keeps a mental Rolodex of player contracts and salaries throughout the league , just to think of possible trade scenarios . The players think she ’s terrifying . They call her Rosemarie The Reaper . ”
67903	67908	67909	67909	I	1543	“ Oh my God . ”
67933	67948	67909	67909	I	1543	“ Are you sure it ’s not your grandma you take after , Julian ? ”
67949	67966	67967	67967	Julian	88	“ You know , it ’s got ta be a mix of both her and Dad , ”
67974	67989	67967	67967	Julian	88	“ I ’m a reflection of them . Emmett ’s a reflection of Grandpa . ”
67990	68014	67909	67909	I	1543	“ In that case , your entire family had to be your grandparents ’ favorites . There ’s no way they were n’t . ”
68015	68034	67967	67967	Julian	88	“ Oh , we were . And we still are . Though for different reasons now , probably . ”
68090	68225	68298	68301	a big enough family	994	“ I was twenty - three when my grandpa ’s cancer spread to his bones . I remember me and Emmett and my parents spending a lot of time in hospice with him and Grandma . We would just play cards , or talk , or watch the game , but it was good . It felt like we were taking our time to say goodbye , and we were leaving off on some laughter and good conversation . We took the time to make new memories instead of just talking about the old ones . Though we did that too . It was just a nice , peaceful time , all things considered . Both my grandparents accepted what was happening , and for the most part , they were at peace with it .
68226	68271	68298	68301	a big enough family	994	“ But my aunts and uncles and cousins visited occasionally to quickly ask how my grandpa was feeling before interrogating him about the will . They were afraid he was leaving his best real estate to my father , because he was the favorite . ”
68272	68277	68278	68278	I	1543	“ Oh , Jesus , ”
68332	68342	68343	68343	Julian	88	“ Yeah , they were shameless . And horrible , ”
68410	68421	68422	68422	Julian	88	“ My dad wanted to keep peace with his siblings , ”
68425	68625	68422	68422	Julian	88	“ He felt like my grandpa deserved to see his family whole before he went . And I resented that . I hated keeping quiet when these people came barreling in during our last conversations with him . We would be talking about something that was making Grandpa laugh when they ’d storm through demanding answers about the will . My cousin , Paul , was the worst of anyone . He was the oldest , he was married , and he had his second child on the way , so he was hell - bent on inheriting some real estate . He pushed everyone aside to badger my grandfather till he was in tears . I do n’t remember what I did , but I snapped . I remembered everyone screaming for me to stop , and I know I at least dragged Paul out of the room before I choked him out . Emmett pulled me off of him before I could do any more damage . But really , the damage was done . Everyone was screaming and crying . My dad pulled me aside and tore me a new asshole for treating family like that . ”
68626	68638	68639	68639	I	1543	“ But what about the way they were treating their family ? ”
68665	68682	68652	68655	Julian ’s asshole cousin	1816	“ How could he possibly care about just the property when your grandfather was about to – ”
68704	68790	68652	68655	Julian ’s asshole cousin	1816	“ I know . Nothing made sense to me that day , and I felt like I was helpless for once . Everyone was furious with me , and I could n’t stick around without doing more damage , so I talked alone with my grandfather . He said he loved me , he understood , and he knew I needed to just get away for a bit – to cool off . He said that we ’d say goodbye now . Just in case . ”
68861	68877	68878	68878	Julian	88	“ I took my bike , actually . It was my preferred getaway , too , ”
68955	68961	68962	68962	I	1543	“ Where did you go ? ”
68966	68971	68972	68972	he	88	“ Nowhere in particular , ”
68975	69026	68972	68972	he	88	“ I just rode . I rode for probably five hours to calm myself down . I was close to Martha ’s Vineyard by the time my heart was beating normally again . But when I checked my phone , I had more than fifty missed calls , texts and voicemails .
69035	69040	69041	69041	I	1543	“ Your grandfather passed ? ”
69065	69068	69069	69069	he	88	“ No , ”
69072	69090	69069	69069	he	88	“ It was my dad . He had a massive heart attack an hour after I left . ”
69285	69318	69319	69319	he	591	“ She ’s apologized profusely since , but she blamed me then . She said I drove my father to that point . And I did . You ca n’t deny that , ”
69330	69336	69337	69337	he	591	“ You really ca n’t , ”
69349	69406	69337	69337	he	591	“ I shocked him , and I angered him so badly it killed him . I did n’t get to say goodbye to him . We just left off . It still feels like we ’re up in the air , and wherever he is , he ’s always wishing he could say something to me . ”
69470	69483	69484	69484	I	1543	“ You have to know he ’s proud of you , Julian , ”
69487	69605	69484	69484	I	1543	“ How could he be anything but that ? You put his early business lessons to work , you founded your company – you even followed through on your grandfather ’s promise to buy the New York Empires . That ’s crazy , Julian . You and the people around you might be used to your success and achievements at this point , but as an outside party , let me tell you that I am constantly in awe of you . You are unstoppable , and considering the unreal accomplishments you ’ve had so far , I ca n’t imagine a greater honor than being the motivation for your success , the way your family is . ”
69622	69639	69640	69640	I	1543	“ You told me yesterday to stop blaming myself and trying to repent for the past , ”
69645	69701	69702	69702	I	1543	“ so I ’m telling you now to allow the same for yourself . A part of you has to know you deserve it . You gave your grandmother the opportunity to be Rosie The Reaper to a bunch of big pro ballers . Your grandfather is definitely somewhere laughing with your dad about that , ”
69717	69725	69702	69702	I	1543	“ They ’re definitely pleased about that . ”
69726	69729	69702	69702	I	1543	“ Exactly . ”
69750	69758	69759	69759	he	88	“ My guilt does n’t end there , ”
69772	69777	69759	69759	he	88	“ What else happened ? ”
69778	69790	69759	69759	he	88	“ I was estranged for years from my mother and Emmett . ”
69834	69924	69759	69759	he	88	“ I went home for my father and grandfather ’s funerals , but I moved overseas shortly after . Just weeks after . There was a sudden wall between me and the rest of my family . My mom could n’t look at me . She did n’t want to . Emmett claimed it was because I reminded her too much of our father , and not because she blamed me for his death , but I knew that was a lie . So , I moved to Stockholm . ”
69925	69932	69933	69933	I	1543	“ Stockholm ? As in Sweden ? ”
69938	70021	69759	69759	he	88	“ Yes . People do n’t associate the city with being the tech hub it is , but it was there that I wound up starting the company that would become Hoult Communications . It was Hoult Media at the time , and it offered mobile content like news , sports scores , et cetera . Once we developed a mobile payment technology , the company surpassed a billion dollars in value . I was twenty - seven when I sold it . ”
70022	70026	70027	70027	I	1543	“ Holy shit . ”
70047	70058	70059	70059	I	1543	“ So you spent four years away from your family , ”
70094	70248	70068	70069	my dad	249	“ It was n’t easy . But as time went on , the wall between us just got higher and higher . More and more miscommunications built up . My mother can be incredibly proud and hard headed , and when I asked if I could send her money , she took it as a slight . She thought I was trying to buy her forgiveness for abandoning them when this entire time , I swore she was the one who abandoned me . I was so angry for so long , and I missed my dad . A lot . I had always grown up telling myself I would be exactly like him , so with my mother and my relationship on the rocks , and Emmett just doing whatever he could to keep her afloat , I filled the void with a woman I worked with . Elizabet . Or Liz . ”
70249	70259	70068	70069	my dad	249	“ I ’m going to guess she ’s French . ”
70260	70275	70068	70069	my dad	249	“ Yes . She was something of an assistant to me at Hoult Media . ”
70276	70284	70285	70285	I	1543	“ You were in love with her ? ”
70302	70388	70068	70069	my dad	249	“ I thought I was . In reality , I just wanted to replace the family I lost , and I was hasty . I picked someone I thought was important to me because I conflated her significance to me with the success of my company . She was in the office every day watching me grow it from a startup , and my perception of her was skewed thanks to that . After we split for good , I made a rule for myself . ”
70389	70401	70402	70402	I	1543	“ Zero tolerance . Never sleep with or date an employee , ”
70414	70417	70068	70069	my dad	249	“ Yes . ”
70418	70423	70424	70424	I	1543	“ Split for good ? ”
70430	70437	70424	70424	I	1543	“ What caused the final split ? ”
70465	70505	70445	70445	he	88	“ Liz said for a long time , it was easy to pretend I loved her the way she loved me . But then Lucie came along , and she saw what real love looked like in my eyes . ”
70509	70512	70513	70513	I	1543	“ Lucie ? ”
70528	70532	70513	70513	I	1543	“ My daughter . ”
70548	70555	70556	70556	Julian	88	“ She is n’t biologically mine , ”
70563	70617	70556	70556	Julian	88	“ Liz got pregnant with her around the time of one of our breaks , but I specifically did n’t do anything to confirm paternity when Liz said the child belonged to me . I wanted a kid . I wanted that family . I raised Lucie till she was four years old . ”
70618	70623	70624	70624	I	1543	“ Oh my God , ”
70641	70647	70624	70624	I	1543	“ How old were you ? ”
70648	70653	70654	70654	Julian	88	“ Twenty - five , ”
70657	70740	70654	70654	Julian	88	“ From the ages of twenty - five and twenty - nine , I was a dad . And a fucking good one . I was the father my own father raised me to become , and I was proud of myself . I adored Lucie in a way I did n’t know was possible . But Liz could n’t handle it . Lucie and I were closer than she was to either of us . Lucie had anxiety . Panic attacks . ”
70800	70817	70818	70818	Julian	88	“ I was the only one who could calm her down , and Liz resented that , ”
70821	70860	70818	70818	Julian	88	“ She resented that she was second best to the both of us . She resented that the love Lucie and I had together upstaged anything we had for her , and it was a painful daily reminder . ”
70861	70866	70867	70867	I	1543	“ That sounds hard , ”
70912	70932	70933	70933	Julian	88	“ It had to be hard . I did n’t even realize myself how much it had to hurt , ”
70941	71000	70933	70933	Julian	88	“ I was just so hell - bent on having a family again . I was transfixed with Lucie , and with being a father . It felt like through the universe , my dad and I were somehow sharing a connection again . I knew exactly what he had felt when he was raising Emmett and me . ”
71016	71063	71064	71064	He	88	“ Lucie would look at pictures of my dad and say ‘ Grandpa , ’ and it was the best feeling . I was so over the moon , I did n’t know Liz was unhappy . I had no idea I was hurting her constantly . ”
71067	71082	71064	71064	He	88	“ And I had no idea that she was plotting to hurt me back . ”
71091	71094	71064	71064	He	88	“ How ? ”
71095	71147	71064	71064	He	88	“ I woke up one morning in December , and they were gone . Bags packed . Just gone . Liz did n’t tell me where she went with Lucie , and it was n’t till months later that I found out they moved to France , where Liz is from . ”
71148	71151	71152	71152	I	1543	“ Biarritz ? ”
71155	71192	71064	71064	He	88	“ No , but close by . She had always talked about going there with her family growing up , and how it was always a dream , and she wanted to raise her children there . ”
71193	71200	71201	71201	I	1543	“ So you built the resort , ”
71214	71272	71064	71064	He	88	“ Yes . Before all the renovations and additions , it started out as a home . A big one . Liz said if I somehow showed her my love , maybe she would come back . Just maybe . So I designed a fucking mansion for her . At least I said it was for her . ”
71273	71280	71315	71317	this little girl	88	“ But it was for Lucie . ”
71281	71284	71064	71064	He	88	“ Yes . ”
71386	71433	71516	71516	his	1543	“ They live somewhere outside of Paris now . Liz told me she would make sure I ’d never be close to Lucie again . She promised me she would stop speaking English to her , and place her in a strictly French - speaking school . ”
71446	71457	71516	71516	his	1543	“ So Lucie would be unable to communicate with you ? ”
71458	71512	71516	71516	his	1543	“ Yes . She writes letters here and there , and I provide financial support here and there . But the relationship we once had is gone , and now that she ’s almost nine , I doubt she really remembers it . Which is okay . It ’s less painful for her . ”
71620	71623	71624	71624	I	1543	“ Hey . ”
71661	71672	71636	71636	He	88	“ I know it was hard to say all that . ”
71688	71698	71673	71673	He	88	“ Not as hard as it could ’ve been . ”
71735	71740	71741	71741	she	240	“ You ’re awake , ”
71748	71754	71741	71741	she	240	“ I can see it . ”
71758	71769	71755	71755	I	1543	“ I ’m awake . But I ’m still recovering . ”
72195	72205	72206	72206	Sara	240	“ You came all over my hand last night , ”
72222	72234	72206	72206	Sara	240	“ You were a very sleepy , sexy girl last night . ”
72235	72256	72209	72209	I	1543	“ Mm , well , I ’m not going to lay there doing nothing if my man needs to come . ”
72262	72266	72257	72257	I	1543	“ Your man ? ”
72528	72531	72532	72532	I	1543	“ Easy , ”
72536	72553	72532	72532	I	1543	“ Tell me what you want for breakfast . I ’m going to cook for you . ”
72557	72561	72554	72554	She	240	“ You are ? ”
72562	72573	72554	72554	She	240	“ Yes . But that requires a few things first . ”
72574	72577	72554	72554	She	240	“ What ? ”
72578	72607	72554	72554	She	240	“ We need to pack so we ’re ready to go after we eat . But even before that , we need to go on a grocery run . ”
72608	72614	72615	72615	Sara	240	“ And even before that ? ”
72657	72667	72638	72638	I	1543	“ I think you know the answer to that . ”
72668	72673	72674	72674	Sara	240	“ Mm - hm . ”
72830	72839	72840	72840	she	240	“ I ’m on the pill , Julian , ”
72843	72849	72840	72840	she	240	“ And I ’m clean . ”
73225	73242	73243	73243	Julian	88	“ Let ’s just stay another night . We ’ll leave for the airport from here , ”
73263	73296	73297	73297	I	1543	“ What ? You just told me you had somewhere to be at two . I ’m all packed . Once I finish drying this glass , we ’re good to go , ”
73319	73333	73389	73389	Julian	88	“ You ’re cute when you ’re mad at me for something small . ”
73334	73337	73338	73338	I	1543	“ Versus ? ”
73351	73370	73389	73389	Julian	88	“ When you ’re mad at me for something like forcing you to change into work appropriate clothes . ”
73379	73388	73371	73371	I	1543	“ God , that feels like forever ago . ”
73392	73397	73398	73398	he	88	“ Was n’t it ? ”
73443	73457	73458	73458	I	1543	“ Hey , are n’t you always getting on Emmett for being late ? ”
73472	73481	73458	73458	I	1543	“ Julian . Get up off the couch . ”
73485	73489	73482	73482	He	88	“ Come here . ”
73524	73529	73530	73530	I	1543	“ What ’s up ? ”
73535	73547	73530	73530	I	1543	“ Are you idling because you do n’t want to go ? ”
73548	73551	73530	73530	I	1543	“ Yes . ”
73566	73616	73552	73552	I	1543	“ I can imagine how hard it is to have to smile and fake nice for the rest of your family . I could n’t forgive them either . But it ’s only one day a year . It ’s for your grandma . And for Grandpa and Dad . ”
73617	73621	73622	73622	Julian	88	“ I know . ”
73641	73650	73631	73631	He	88	“ I want you to come with me . ”
73655	73658	73659	73659	I	1543	“ What ? ”
73672	73675	73659	73659	I	1543	“ Really ? ”
73676	73682	73659	73659	I	1543	“ Yes . Will you ? ”
73683	73687	73688	73688	I	1543	“ Of course , ”
73691	73703	73688	73688	I	1543	“ But … wo n’t everyone think I ’m your girlfriend ? ”
73704	73715	73659	73659	I	1543	“ Yes . But you can fake it , right ? ”
73716	73737	73688	73688	I	1543	“ I have n’t had to fake it this entire last month , so I might be out of practice . ”
73743	73758	73738	73738	Julian	88	“ Are you trying to turn me on or get me out the door ? ”
73759	73763	73764	73764	I	1543	“ The latter , ”
73776	73795	73764	73764	I	1543	“ Come on , Hoult . Let ’s get our asses on that bike . We got this . ”
73798	73815	73797	73797	SARA	240	“ Oh my God . I ’m seeing things . Rosie , am I seeing things ? ”
73856	73859	73860	73860	Julian	88	“ Mom , ”
73919	73941	73942	73942	she	181	“ Oh , no ! No handshake . I need to hug the first woman my son ’s ever brought home , ”
73986	73991	74024	74024	I	1543	“ Well , technically – ”
73992	74023	74024	74024	I	1543	“ Oh , I know , Julian , technically , we ’re not home , this is a restaurant , but still . Sara , please . Come meet Rosemarie . ”
74064	74072	74060	74060	Rosemarie	150	“ Has he told you my nickname ? ”
74073	74078	74079	74079	I	1543	“ Rosemarie The Reaper , ”
74090	74095	74096	74096	Rosemarie	177	“ That ’s right , ”
74101	74109	74096	74096	Rosemarie	177	“ Those boys are terrified of me . ”
74193	74201	74202	74202	Julian	88	“ You did better than I did , ”
74257	74264	74265	74265	I	1543	“ Thanks . Are you okay ? ”
74280	74291	74292	74292	he	88	“ I ’m pretty damned good right now , actually , ”
74307	74316	74317	74317	Julian	88	“ Well . Now I ’m just okay , ”
74375	74380	74381	74381	I	1543	“ Hi , Emmett , ”
74384	74396	74397	74397	he	88	“ Hi . I … think I owe you an apology , ”
74403	74414	74397	74397	he	88	“ Mind if I borrow her a sec , brother ? ”
74415	74419	74420	74420	Julian	88	“ I do . ”
74428	74435	74420	74420	Julian	88	“ Where are you taking her ? ”
74436	74439	74440	74440	I	1543	“ Julian , ”
74453	74471	74420	74420	Julian	88	“ Fine , borrow her . But return her to me as soon as possible , please . ”
74472	74480	74481	74481	I	1543	“ You got it , lover boy . ”
74533	74538	74539	74539	Emmett	319	“ Look , I … ”
74544	74556	74539	74539	Emmett	319	“ I do n’t even … well , first of all – ”
74557	74564	74565	74565	I	1543	“ Emmett . Do n’t worry , ”
74569	74649	74565	74565	I	1543	“ I know it looked pretty bad that night when I ran away . I ’m not going to try to explain why I reacted so strongly , but what I will say is that your brother took pretty damned good care of me that night . I ’m fine now . You slipped up , but it ’s not the end of the world . I had a great weekend , and I ’m not angry at all . ”
74658	74670	74650	74650	Emmett	319	“ Wow . That went a lot better than I thought . ”
74671	74687	74688	74688	I	1543	“ What , you thought I was going to be a raging bitch about it ? ”
74691	74735	74650	74650	Emmett	319	“ No , but Julian tore me a new one all night after you guys left . He really did n’t let it go , he was beyond pissed for you . I was about to offer him my truck as an apology . ”
74736	74748	74749	74749	I	1543	“ Well , we did take your truck home that night , ”
74752	74781	74782	74782	Emmett	319	“ Yeah , but I mean for keeps . Anyway , thank you , Sara . I ’m so fucking grateful that you ’re not pissed at me , ”
74795	74813	74782	74782	Emmett	319	“ You probably know this , but my brother likes you a lot . I can tell . ”
74817	74823	74814	74814	I	1543	“ How can you tell ? ”
74824	74827	74828	74828	Emmett	319	“ Man . ”
74846	74897	74828	74828	Emmett	319	“ It ’s kind of crazy , but I can see the difference in him . In just the way he looks and talks . Sometimes he can be kind of … vacant . Like he ’s on autopilot . And it just feels like he has n’t been lately . ”
74925	74956	74957	74957	he	319	“ It feels like he ’s actually in the moment , and present , and reacting . Like you flipped a light switch in him . Does that make sense ? ”
74960	74974	74957	74957	he	319	“ It makes perfect sense . And it ’s incredibly flattering to me . ”
74975	74987	74988	74988	Emmett	319	“ Well , I ’m actually not trying to flatter you , ”
74991	75050	74988	74988	Emmett	319	“ It ’s just the truth . And listen , I know you guys are leaving for Biarritz tomorrow , and I just wanna say , when you ’re there with him … if you see or hear anything that mentions the name Lucie , do n’t … jump to conclusions . It ’s not what you think . ”
75076	75094	75051	75051	I	1543	“ You ’re very sweet , Emmett , but Julian already told me about Liz and Lucie . ”
75095	75101	75102	75102	Emmett	319	“ Jesus fuck , seriously ? ”
75107	75113	75114	75114	He	319	“ Wow , that ’s … ”
75133	75155	75156	75156	He	319	“ That ’s really fucking amazing . That ’s really cool , ‘ cause I did n’t think he would ever – ”
75171	75268	75162	75162	He	319	“ Look , I ’m supposed to stop blowing up his spot , but I just got ta say – whatever he feels for you , Sara , I think it ’s pretty big . Right ? It ’s got ta be . It took me two years to get the full story about Liz and Lucie out of him . Lukas does n’t even know most of it , so … thank you for being someone my brother feels like he can talk to . He ’s never really chosen to have one of those . ”
75301	75304	75307	75307	Julian	88	“ Alright . ”
75319	75335	75336	75336	he	88	“ I ’m sure whatever you ’ve said by now , the damage is sufficient , ”
75342	75355	75336	75336	he	88	“ I ’ve come to collect her if you ’re finished here . ”
75356	75360	75307	75307	Julian	88	“ Sure am . ”
75369	75399	75361	75361	Julian	88	“ I know you might have just reached your limit of Hoults for today , but my mother is requesting some time with you , if that ’s okay . ”
75400	75407	75408	75408	I	1543	“ That ’s more than okay , ”
75411	75417	75418	75418	Emmett	319	“ Shit , hold on , ”
75421	75436	75437	75437	he	88	“ Actually , I have one more thing to say to Sara , okay ? ”
75450	75464	75465	75465	he	88	“ Just go , J. She ’ll be right there . I promise , ”
75495	75570	75571	75571	Emmett	319	“ Look , I just wanted to say … in case he ever pisses you off , because Lord knows he pisses me off a lot … my brother ’s a really good man . The best I know . And when he cares about someone , he ’ll stop at nothing to make sure that person is happy , and safe , and completely taken care of for the rest of their life , ”
75580	75610	75571	75571	Emmett	319	“ There ’s really only a few people he regards that highly outside his family – Lukas being one of them , and I guess you being the other . ”
75611	75626	75627	75627	I	1543	“ Sure you ’re not trying to butter me up right now , Emmett ? ”
75639	75655	75656	75656	Emmett	319	“ Yeah , I ’m not smart enough to blow smoke up people ’s asses , ”
75663	75692	75693	75693	he	319	“ What you see is what you get . And honestly , I was just telling you that because sometimes Julian … he can hurt people without realizing , ”
75704	75831	75832	75832	Emmett	319	“ He does n’t mean to – he ’s just so focused on something else , usually work . And if he somehow hurts your feelings during this trip because say , he ’s really busy , or distracted , or just plain being himself – just know that it ’s worth it to stick around with him . Even if you do n’t know what the hell he ’s thinking half the time , and you ca n’t stand that he does n’t say much . He ’s still a good man who ’s going to take care of you . I mean he ’s definitely the best guy I know . I ’m still kind of hoping to be him when I grow up , ”
75843	75853	75854	75854	I	1543	“ Thank you , Emmett . I appreciate it , ”
75862	75872	75873	75873	he	319	“ Alright . Go talk to my mom now , ”
75876	75888	75889	75889	he	319	“ And sorry ahead of time if she brings up grandkids ! ”
76141	76150	76151	76151	she	1031	“ There ’s more than where we live , ”
76171	76177	76178	76178	she	1031	“ Daddy taught me that , ”
76195	76215	76216	76216	I	1543	“ Yeah , he taught you that by bringing you to London and then forcing you to live here , ”
76220	76243	76178	76178	she	1031	“ Yes , but now I have a car . I have these big roads . I can go anywhere I want . ”
76244	76249	76178	76178	she	1031	“ You never do . ”
76250	76257	76178	76178	she	1031	“ What am I doing now ? ”
76258	76277	76278	76278	My	1543	“ What , it took me getting in trouble for you to start exploring ? That ’s sad . ”
76290	76296	76297	76297	Mom	1031	“ Maybe that ’s sad , ”
76300	76323	76297	76297	Mom	1031	“ But sometimes it takes a tragedy for us to get moving . To find the strength to look for better things . ”
76324	76332	76278	76278	My	1543	“ So I ’m a tragedy now ? ”
76959	76985	76986	76987	my dad	1571	“ You should have found a school to transfer to in London . Your mother would have moved back here with you in a heartbeat , ”
77003	77019	76986	76987	my dad	1571	“ Yeah , right . Like you ’d survive being away from her so much . ”
77020	77041	76986	76987	my dad	1571	“ I would fly to see you two every Friday . And then I ’d return to work on Monday . ”
77045	77070	77042	77042	I	1543	“ We do n’t have the money for that . Sorry . But one day , I ’ll earn it for you . Promise . ”
77071	77076	77077	77077	Dad	355	“ I believe you . ”
77085	77173	77077	77077	Dad	355	“ You ’re hardworking enough , and the fact that you chose New York to start over tells me you ’re not scared of anything . But let me tell you something . Some people with your brains and your talent still get lost in a city as big as that one , because there are so many people and so much to do . But I believe in you that you ’ll look temptation in the eye , walk right past it and make yourself proud . ”
77174	77181	77042	77042	I	1543	“ And you and Mama proud . ”
77182	77186	77187	77187	Dad	355	“ Us too , ”
77190	77322	77187	77187	Dad	355	“ No matter what you think sometimes , we could never stay mad at you . Sometimes , the heartbreak will hit us out of nowhere , because you ’re our daughter and we wish you never even had to experience what you did at that school . We get angry that you were hurt . You might see us during those times and think we ’re angry with you , but we ’re not . We ’re just going to take time to forget what happened , Sara . But eventually , we will . Your mother and I just want you to be safe and happy . That ’s all any parent wants . We ’re proud of you , Sara , and we believe very much in you . ”
77719	77728	77729	77729	Julian	88	“ I wish I ’d found you earlier , ”
77750	77763	77729	77729	Julian	88	“ I would have hired you to my company in a heartbeat . ”
77767	77791	77792	77792	I	1543	“ Yeah , but that ’s the point . You would n’t have found me earlier , because I felt too safe there , ”
77795	77829	77792	77792	I	1543	“ And after everything I ’d been through , there was nothing more important to me than feeling safe . Like there ’s nothing to worry about , and I can just relax . ”
77830	77833	77834	77834	Julian	88	“ Understood , ”
77957	77980	77981	77981	she	240	“ It ’s so crazy . There ’s old castles , but there ’s Art Deco , and there ’s this water , ”
78038	78055	78056	78056	she	240	“ If The Great Gatsby took place anywhere but West Egg , it would be here , ”
78402	78408	78409	78409	she	240	“ What are you thinking ? ”
78429	78432	78409	78409	she	240	“ Nothing . ”
78557	78564	78565	78565	Her	240	“ a glorious selection of condiments . ”
78575	78579	78580	78580	I	1543	“ Why Tuscany ? ”
78583	78587	78525	78525	her	240	“ Because wine . ”
78588	78595	78525	78525	her	240	“ Fair enough . Why Monaco ? ”
78596	78601	78525	78525	her	240	“ Because Grace Kelly . ”
78602	78615	78525	78525	her	240	“ Your best friend once said my mother looked like Grace Kelly . ”
78616	78653	78525	78525	her	240	“ She so does ! I totally thought that yesterday . And Lia totally went on her Grace Kelly kick because of me . She ’d never watch old Hollywood movies without me bugging her to . ”
78673	78677	78525	78525	her	240	“ Biggest goal ? ”
78690	78716	78717	78717	she	131	“ The thing I dreamed for longest about was definitely going to prom and feeling like a princess in some big , puffy ball gown , ”
78720	78760	78717	78717	she	131	“ Since I was five , I fantasized about every detail down to the big reveal of my dress , and the walk down the stairs , and my date putting on my corsage as my parents took pictures . ”
78761	78764	78678	78678	She	131	“ Jesus . ”
78765	78777	78778	78778	she	131	“ Do n’t blame me . The stupid movies ruined me , ”
78781	78838	78778	78778	she	131	“ But anyway , since that ship has clearly sailed , I ’d say the big goal is making enough money in the future to buy my parents a home in London . So they can fly back and forth between there and Texas . A three - bedroom , preferably . For when I visit . ”
78839	78850	78678	78678	She	131	“ Why three bedrooms ? Do your parents sleep separately ? ”
78851	78871	78778	78778	she	131	“ My dad does snore like a beast , but no . I imagined for like , my kids . ”
78872	78883	78678	78678	She	131	“ Yeah ? And how many kids do you want ? ”
78884	78887	78888	78888	She	1138	“ Three . ”
78898	78901	78888	78888	She	1138	“ Yourself ? ”
78902	78912	78913	78913	I	1543	“ At least one . No more than three , ”
79025	79028	79029	79029	he	95	“ Sorry , ”
79039	79086	79087	79087	Colin	95	“ So , Turner and Carter are here , and they ’re … clearly not accustomed to working straight off a flight . Carter is going to sleep in his room right now , but Turner insists he ’ll come for your meeting with the advisors . ”
79090	79112	79087	79087	Colin	95	“ He made it a really big deal that he was bestowing us with his presence , considering his jet lag . ”
79116	79133	79113	79113	I	1543	“ Jesus . I do n’t even need him here anymore . His work is done . ”
79134	79197	79198	79198	Colin	95	“ Yes , well , now he just needs to be babysat and ego - stroked while you talk to the guys with the brains . Speaking of them , they ’re early for the meeting in the salon , but I had the kitchen set up coffee and a breakfast platter in the meantime . Is , um , Sara joining ? ”
79223	79239	79240	79240	I	1543	“ I would say it ’s not what it looks like , but it is , ”
79261	79291	79251	79251	Colin	95	“ Oh . Well , she ’s extremely smart , kind and capable , so if a rule were to be broken for anyone , it should be her . ”
79292	79297	79298	79298	I	1543	“ I appreciate it , ”
79311	79343	79301	79301	We	1144	“ To answer your question , Sara wo n’t be joining this meeting . She needs to meet with members of hotel staff to prep the Roths ’ tour after breakfast , ”
79362	79385	79386	79386	he	95	“ Uh , sir – I know the itinerary is clear , but Turner specifically requested that she join us at breakfast , ”
79392	79414	79416	79416	SARA	240	“ She ’s busy right now , so I ’ll have her join late . See you down there in ten . ”
79585	79591	79541	79541	JULIAN	186	“ gem of the Basque Coast ”
79822	79826	79827	79827	he	95	“ This one ! ”
79830	79854	79827	79827	he	95	“ The party does n’t start till this one arrives . Gentlemen , meet the star of the show , Miss Sara Hanna . ”
79999	80012	80013	80013	Turner	319	“ Man , I ca n’t wait to take you surfing later , ”
80026	80045	80046	80046	I	1543	“ Turner , I think we made it clear that I ’m actually not very good at that , ”
80061	80090	80054	80054	He	186	“ Well , I thought it was clear that my enjoyment came less from watching you succeed , and more from watching you splash around in a bikini . ”
80353	80362	80363	80363	he	319	“ My back is stiff from the flight , ”
80426	80435	80436	80436	Turner	319	“ Sara looks like she needs a massage , ”
80450	80469	80470	80470	he	319	“ Maybe we should get a couple ’s massage . You look like you ’re probably very tight , ”
80476	80481	80482	80485	one of his advisors	1169	“ Jesus , Turner , ”
80503	80520	80484	80485	his advisors	2170	“ Turner . Let ’s get you an hour - long Swedish massage . Shall we ? ”
80521	80533	80484	80485	his advisors	2170	“ Trying to get me out of your hair , Hoult ? ”
80534	80537	80538	80538	Julian	88	“ Absolutely , ”
80548	80561	80538	80538	Julian	88	“ Come on . Let me introduce you to our spa manager . ”
80602	80618	80619	80619	Colin	95	“ Sara , he ’s paying us to get massages right now . Come on , ”
80632	80649	80650	80650	he	95	“ I just want you to have some time to enjoy yourself while you ’re here , ”
80657	80675	80650	80650	he	95	“ And I do like keeping elements of my business to myself . I hope you understand . ”
81010	81013	81021	81021	She	188	“ Oh . ”
81181	81188	81189	81189	I	1543	“ Oh my God – asshole ! ”
81210	81214	81215	81215	His	88	“ Lay down . ”
81253	81262	81263	81263	I	1543	“ Are you going to finish my massage ? ”
81266	81274	81263	81263	I	1543	“ I did have twenty minutes left . ”
81275	81283	81284	81284	Julian	88	“ You ’ll get your twenty minutes , ”
81323	81327	81305	81305	I	1543	“ Head down . ”
81576	81584	81585	81585	Julian	88	“ You ’re so ready for me , ”
81626	81633	81634	81634	I	1543	“ Put your fingers inside me , ”
81638	81646	81647	81647	he	88	“ I thought you wanted a massage , ”
81693	81703	81704	81704	he	88	“ Your ass looks so fucking good like this , ”
81722	81731	81710	81710	he	88	“ Look at how hard you have me . ”
81750	81755	81756	81756	I	1543	“ Take them off , ”
81760	81766	81767	81767	Julian	88	“ Lie on your back , ”
81818	81826	81827	81827	Julian	88	“ Massage the oil onto your tits , ”
81957	81967	81968	81968	he	88	“ I do n’t think you realize , Sara , ”
81977	81990	81991	81991	he	88	“ just how much of a fucking animal you turn me into , ”
82044	82089	82037	82037	I	1543	“ Do you have any idea how difficult it is to carry on with a meeting when all I can think about is you ? When all I can see is your perfect fucking body getting rubbed down by hands that are n’t mine ? ”
82090	82099	82100	82100	I	1543	“ I ’m sorry I ruined your meeting , ”
82103	82112	82113	82113	Julian	88	“ You ’ll make it up to me , ”
82132	82139	82129	82129	he	88	“ Spread your legs for me . ”
82192	82197	82198	82198	I	1543	“ Oh my God . ”
82330	82339	82340	82340	he	88	“ Tell me how that feels , baby , ”
82358	82364	82353	82353	I	1543	“ Does that feel good ? ”
82365	82369	82370	82370	I	1543	“ Too good , ”
82852	82860	82861	82861	Turner	319	“ Now this is quite the view , ”
82886	82910	82911	82911	he	1190	“ To be frank with you , Julian , the Roths have long made up their mind . I think you know that , ”
82922	82980	82911	82911	he	1190	“ At this point , we really only need to go through formalities . Then we ’ll get into the extensive paperwork , but as you know , we ’re all very pleased with how well this suits Turner and Carter ’s endeavors . I realize it ’s barely noon , but we should toast to that . ”
82981	82986	82987	82987	Colin	95	“ Just in time , ”
83003	83014	83015	83015	Irv	1816	“ Of course , you ’re always a step ahead , ”
83049	83056	83057	83057	he	189	“ Do you surf , Julian ? ”
83060	83064	83019	83020	the server	1194	“ I do . ”
83065	83079	83028	83029	his colleague	434	“ Ah , of course you do . What do n’t you do ? ”
83080	83089	83090	83090	I	1543	“ I have n’t in a long time , ”
83106	83123	83098	83098	I	1543	“ I ’m not sure how well I ’d fare out there after so many years . ”
83124	83132	83090	83090	I	1543	“ How many years has it been ? ”
83145	83153	83154	83154	I	1543	“ Probably five now . Maybe six , ”
83256	83259	83260	83260	she	302	“ hamster , ”
83689	83704	83673	83673	she	302	“ Hoult , Turner told me great things about the hot stone treatment here . ”
83924	83926	83913	83913	her	302	“ abandoned ”
83928	83931	83932	83932	she	1031	“ unavailable , ”
84394	84397	84451	84451	ME	1543	“ very nice ”
84423	84427	84414	84414	Julian	88	“ you look gorgeous ”
84429	84434	84451	84451	ME	1543	“ damn it Sara , ”
84438	84450	84451	84451	ME	1543	“ come back now so I can take your dress off . ”
84609	84615	84616	84616	he	319	“ Holy shit , enough , ”
84631	84654	84655	84655	he	319	“ Oh , shit ! Look who it is . Quick , press door close so she does n’t follow me in , ”
84673	84678	84679	84679	I	1543	“ Hello , Turner , ”
84685	84702	84703	84703	he	319	“ Hello yourself . Jesus , look at you . I just wanna pull on this , ”
84725	84730	84721	84721	I	1543	“ Please do n’t . ”
84731	84744	84745	84745	he	319	“ That ’s fine , I can see plenty as it is , ”
84783	84801	84802	84802	he	319	“ Listen , Sara , what can you tell me about the age demographics in this town ? ”
84815	84824	84881	84881	Ugh	101	“ The residential population or the tourist population ? ”
84828	84831	84825	84825	Turner	319	“ Whatever . ”
84832	84857	84881	84881	Ugh	101	“ Well , starting with the population on a regular basis , it ’s about twenty - five thousand with a median age around – ”
84858	84880	84825	84825	Turner	319	“ Honestly , all I really want to know is why I ’m having trouble finding girls as pretty as you . ”
84928	84940	84881	84881	Ugh	101	“ I think that ’s above my pay grade , Turner . ”
84941	84967	84968	84968	Turner	319	“ You ’re funny . Seriously though , Sara – what does it feel like to be the most beautiful woman in Biarritz right now ? ”
84983	85022	85023	85023	he	319	“ Do n’t laugh ! Trust me , I ’ve been looking around , I ’ve given it a few shots here and there , but so far , the talent is surprisingly bleak for a surf town , ”
85032	85041	85042	85042	I	1543	“ You never pressed your floor , Turner , ”
85061	85074	85075	85075	He	319	“ I have a question about the age demographics . Business stuff . ”
85086	85093	85075	85075	He	319	“ Can you help me out ? ”
85094	85130	85131	85131	I	1543	“ Absolutely . Would you like to schedule for all of us to meet a little early before dinner ? I ’m sure Julian ’s on the premises , so that can be easily arranged , ”
85150	85168	85169	85169	he	319	“ Nah . I ’ve already got you here . Let ’s just talk in your room , ”
85203	85215	85216	85216	I	1543	“ No , Turner , we should meet in the salon , ”
85220	85234	85239	85239	I	1543	“ Oh , come on , sweetheart . Do n’t be so rigid . ”
85271	85278	85266	85266	She	1543	“ Just humor me , Sara . ”
85279	85284	85285	85285	I	1543	“ Alright , Turner , ”
85310	85331	85302	85302	I	1543	“ Hit me with your question right here . About age demographics ? Is that what you wanted to ask ? ”
85365	85381	85382	85382	he	319	“ Jesus . You really do n’t trust me enough to come in your room ? ”
85390	85404	85363	85363	his	319	“ My room is not a space for a business meeting , Turner . ”
85405	85416	85363	85363	his	319	“ Fine , then let ’s do something besides business . ”
85434	85453	85363	85363	his	319	“ Considering business is precisely what we ’re here for , my answer is going to be no . ”
85454	85473	85479	85479	Turner	319	“ Let ’s be real – your business here is a little different than that of the guys . ”
85474	85478	85363	85363	his	319	“ Come again ? ”
85486	85501	85479	85479	Turner	319	“ Oh , no … you think I do n’t know , do you ? ”
85515	85519	85479	85479	Turner	319	“ Know what ? ”
85520	85526	85527	85527	he	319	“ Why you were hired , ”
85578	85590	85561	85561	I	1543	“ And why do you think I was hired , Turner ? ”
85591	85597	85598	85598	he	319	“ Come on , Sara , ”
85602	85653	85654	85654	he	319	“ Girls like you get jobs like these because they ’re pretty . Because their asses look good in little skirts . You ’re hired strictly to make deals go more smoothly for guys like Julian . It ’s why he hired you to oversee the changes at this resort , ”
85685	85732	85673	85673	I	1543	“ Julian put you out here because people are more inclined to do what you say , Sara . You ’re sweet , and friendly , and pretty , and they subconsciously want to please you . Hell , I know I want to please you . ”
85733	85756	85757	85757	I	1543	“ Turner , from what I observed before you joined me in the elevator , you have your choice of women here , ”
85761	85786	85673	85673	I	1543	“ Well , they do n’t do it for me . I tried using them to scratch the itch – it did n’t work . ”
85818	85835	85815	85815	I	1543	“ Turner , I do have to get ready . I ’ll see you at dinner . ”
85848	85860	85836	85836	His	1543	“ That ass of yours is telling me to come in . ”
85861	85869	85870	85870	I	1543	“ I assure you it ’s not , ”
85877	85895	85896	85896	he	1543	“ Christ . So why even dress like that if you do n’t want me to react ? ”
85912	85938	85899	85899	I	1543	“ You ’re asking me to fuck you and then telling me you do n’t want it . Is that not what ’s going on ? ”
86005	86101	86102	86102	I	1543	“ Mr. Roth , as it turns out , women sometimes do things for their own pleasure and happiness . I wear my clothes because I like them , and because I feel good in them . I enjoy feeling attractive , and if that catches your attention , then you are welcome to look . But unless I invite you , do not ever touch or assume you ’re entitled to . Using the way I dress as an excuse for your lack of respect or self - control is not justified or sufficient . ”
86107	86110	86111	86111	I	1543	“ Okay ? ”
86137	86150	86125	86125	Turner	319	“ You know , you ’re different than all the other girls . ”
86151	86183	86125	86125	Turner	319	“ I ’m not . I ’m just different from the ones you pursue . Cast a wider net and you ’ll meet plenty of women willing to speak their minds . ”
86192	86204	86205	86205	Turner	319	“ Why look for them when I ’ve already got you ? ”
86214	86228	86229	86229	he	319	“ Come on , sweetheart . Just let me in for a second , ”
86232	86243	86229	86229	he	319	“ I ’ll keep it strictly business – pinky swear . ”
86249	86261	86244	86244	I	1543	“ We can discuss anything you want right in this hall . ”
86262	86304	86305	86305	he	319	“ I do n’t want to discuss it in the hall , Sara , and considering I ’m the one making all the final decisions on this trip , you should probably think twice about being so difficult to work with , ”
86327	86412	86317	86317	He	319	“ You know Hoult needs this deal . I ’m by far his highest bidder for this resort , and Roth Entertainment is the only , and I mean only company that can launch Empire Stadium into becoming the most lucrative stadium in New York . Considering the competition , that ’s a big fucking deal in that town . And it ’s a big deal to his family – I ’m sure you know how important his family is to him . Right ? ”
86413	86417	86418	86418	I	1543	“ I do , ”
86599	86615	86616	86616	I	1543	“ I ’m sorry , Turner . But you ’re not coming in my room , ”
86659	86665	86666	86666	He	88	“ Come work for me . ”
86679	86691	86666	86666	He	88	“ I ’ll triple the salary you ’ve got with Hoult . ”
86692	86705	86747	86747	JULIAN	88	“ I appreciate the offer , Turner , but no thank you . ”
86709	86717	86706	86706	He	88	“ You barely gave it a thought . ”
86718	86730	86747	86747	JULIAN	88	“ I did n’t have to . See you at dinner . ”
87124	87134	87135	87136	the server	1194	“ Another glass of champagne for you , sir ? ”
87157	87167	87168	87168	he	1194	“ Another round for everyone . We ’re celebrating , ”
87174	87178	87179	87179	He	1194	“ Turner Roth . ”
87185	87217	87179	87179	He	1194	“ This is my brother , Carter . Remember the names , ‘ cause we ’re buying this resort , so you ’ll be seeing a lot more of us soon . ”
87362	87365	87366	87366	I	1543	“ Gentlemen , ”
87421	87432	87433	87433	Irv	1816	“ You ’re kidding . You have to go already ? ”
87454	87464	87442	87442	he	1816	“ But Turner just ordered a round of champagne . ”
87465	87483	87484	87484	I	1543	“ Yes , unfortunately , the three of us should be wrapping it up soon . Colin , ”
87493	87507	87484	87484	I	1543	“ Remind me the time of our meeting with the marketing team tomorrow ? ”
87508	87516	87442	87442	he	1816	“ Eight in the morning , sir . ”
87517	87522	87523	87523	Irv	1816	“ Oh , wow , ”
87538	87551	87552	87552	he	1816	“ Well , we look forward to seeing you tomorrow at noon , ”
87576	87596	87597	87597	he	1816	“ You shitting me , Hoult ? You gon na let Uncle Rob and Grandpa Irv outlast you tonight ? ”
87601	87620	87597	87597	he	1816	“ At least let Sara stay . Girl just wants to party . Do n’t you , Sara ? ”
87664	87678	87679	87679	she	1257	“ No , Turner , I think I ’d just like to sleep , ”
87686	87689	87690	87690	She	1257	“ Gentlemen . ”
87703	87713	87690	87690	She	1257	“ I look forward to our final meeting tomorrow . ”
87714	87722	87723	87723	Irv	1816	“ As do we , Ms. Hanna , ”
87726	87734	87723	87723	Irv	1816	“ You have a good night now . ”
87735	87740	87690	87690	She	1257	“ You as well . ”
87909	87915	87916	87916	I	1543	“ I need you now , ”
87961	87964	87965	87965	she	240	“ Julian , ”
88008	88013	88014	88014	she	240	“ You ’re crazy , ”
88048	88051	88052	88052	She	240	“ Julian . ”
88065	88072	88055	88055	I	1543	“ You ’re so fucking crazy . ”
88073	88085	88052	88052	She	240	“ You ’re the only one who gets me like this . ”
88086	88090	88091	88091	she	240	“ I know , ”
88094	88099	88100	88100	I	1543	“ Pleased with yourself ? ”
88121	88133	88134	88134	I	1543	“ Are you happy that I have no control around you ? ”
88153	88168	88134	88134	I	1543	“ You make me feel like I ’m losing my fucking mind , Sara . ”
88169	88177	88178	88178	she	240	“ You do it worse to me , ”
88271	88279	88261	88261	she	240	“ I want you to fuck me . ”
88304	88319	88320	88320	SARA	240	“ Seriously , man . Fuck Hoult for leaving right after I ordered champagne . ”
88426	88440	88441	88441	Carter	87	“ He ’s just mad you might fuck his assistant before he does , ”
88475	88518	88467	88467	Turner	319	“ That dude ’s got such a stick up his ass . If she worked for me , I ’d be smashing every day at the office . I ’d fuck her right in front of everyone . I would n’t care . ”
88519	88526	88527	88527	Carter	87	“ The guys would love that , ”
88530	88541	88527	88527	Carter	87	“ She ’s got some fuckin ’ tits on her . ”
88579	88616	88617	88617	he	319	“ Yeah , I ’m pissed I did n’t get to see those things that night at the pool . I swear she was shaking them around on purpose to get my dick fuckin ’ hard , ”
88645	88656	88636	88636	My	1543	“ Should ’ve fucked her right in front of Julian . ”
88706	88709	88710	88710	he	319	“ Baby , ”
88727	88743	88744	88744	I	1543	“ I fuckin ’ tried getting in her room today . She shut me down . ”
88859	88868	88869	88869	Carter	87	“ Just kick the door open next time , ”
88872	88891	88869	88869	Carter	87	“ For her I might have to . I ’m gon na fuck her one way or another . ”
88987	88999	89000	89000	Carter	87	“ We ’ll find a way to get her clothes off , ”
89089	89092	89093	89093	Julian	88	“ Mine , ”
89113	89119	89120	89120	He	88	“ You belong to me . ”
89132	89138	89120	89120	He	88	“ Only me , Sara . ”
89139	89146	89147	89147	I	1543	“ That ’s all I want , ”
89241	89248	89249	89249	Julian	88	“ Come for me , baby , ”
89750	89753	89754	89754	I	1543	“ Hey , ”
89796	89802	89803	89803	I	1543	“ You ’re almost there , ”
89829	89837	89838	89838	Julian	88	“ Thank you , by the way , ”
89866	89870	89871	89871	I	1543	“ For what ? ”
89875	89883	89871	89871	I	1543	“ Making this trip easier for me . ”
89884	89895	89851	89851	they	1295	“ I hardly did anything with the Roths this trip . ”
89896	89907	89908	89908	he	88	“ I do n’t mean in regards to the sale , ”
89926	89947	89908	89908	he	88	“ I mean just … being here . In Biarritz . It ’s not usually an easy trip for me . ”
90004	90022	90023	90023	I	1543	“ I did n’t even think about how hard it was for you to come back here , ”
90030	90072	90073	90073	Julian	88	“ It usually is , but it was n’t this time . I barely recognize this place when I ’m here with you . It just feels like another beautiful French city when I get to see it through your eyes , ”
90095	90124	90087	90087	He	88	“ That said I hope you did n’t enjoy your time here too much , because I have no intention of ever coming back once we ’re gone . ”
90125	90133	90134	90134	I	1543	“ I can always come here alone , ”
90137	90150	90151	90151	Julian	88	“ It would be a waste to let you go somewhere alone , ”
90154	90159	90087	90087	He	88	“ Why ’s that ? ”
90160	90175	90176	90176	he	88	“ Because you ’re so beautiful when you see something for the first time , ”
90180	90193	90176	90176	he	88	“ I would n’t want to miss all those faces you make . ”
90198	90208	90194	90194	I	1543	“ Are you trying to make my cheeks hurt ? ”
90209	90237	90238	90238	he	88	“ I ’m not . But I ’ve become pretty dependent on seeing that smile , so whatever makes you happy , I ’ll keep doing it , ”
90367	90372	90373	90373	I	1543	“ What ’s that ? ”
90391	90401	90383	90383	Julian	88	“ Hey . I ’m sorry I woke you . ”
90402	90414	90415	90415	I	1543	“ You did n’t . I just stir here and there , ”
90427	90433	90415	90415	I	1543	“ Is that from Lucie ? ”
90474	90503	90470	90470	he	88	“ It ’s the last letter she sent where she wrote that she missed me , and she still did n’t understand why she could n’t see me . ”
90504	90512	90470	90470	he	88	“ How long ago is it from ? ”
90513	90542	90543	90543	Julian	88	“ About two - and - a - half years ago . She had just turned six . She ’s thanking me for the birthday presents in this , ”
90553	90563	90470	90470	he	88	“ Oh . You … know where they live ? ”
90564	90567	90470	90470	he	88	“ Yes . ”
90568	90583	90584	90584	My	1543	“ And you do n’t ever get tempted to go there and find them ? ”
90605	90626	90627	90627	Julian	88	“ I thought about it every business trip I ’ve ever taken out here . I thought about it today , ”
90664	90680	90656	90656	I	1543	“ Figured it was almost like a last chance . But I decided against it . ”
90681	90684	90650	90650	his	88	“ Why ? ”
90685	90781	90656	90656	I	1543	“ Because she ’s perfectly adjusted now . She ’s moved on from her memories of me , and it would be selfish for me to barrel into her life now and ruin the peace . She ’s still too young to fully understand the situation . She would n’t know how to handle the fact that her mother has fed her lies about me . She ’d just feel confusion and resentment , and all I want is for her to be happy . I do n’t want her to feel what I feel . ”
90826	90841	90842	90842	I	1543	“ You ’re a good man to give her the peace to move on , ”
90845	90864	90842	90842	I	1543	“ Most people would just indulge their impulses without thinking about how it might affect the other person . ”
90876	90898	90899	90899	I	1543	“ I think it ’s noble for you to take on the hurt for her . Not everybody would do that , ”
91003	91025	91026	91026	I	1543	“ Maybe in the future , you two can reconnect , and you can give her your side of the story , ”
91029	91045	90981	90981	they	708	“ I hope she understands by then why I eventually stopped trying to see her . ”
91046	91050	91051	91051	I	1543	“ She will , ”
91054	91104	91051	91051	I	1543	“ Everyone finds out eventually how fragile the healing process is . Maybe she ’ll figure it out after her first big breakup , and she ’ll understand that even after the wound ’s closed , it ’s still delicate , and sensitive , and it still needs time . ”
91112	91117	91118	91118	he	88	“ What about yours ? ”
91121	91127	91128	91128	I	1543	“ What ? My wound ? ”
91134	91154	91128	91128	I	1543	“ It ’s been healing since we left the Hamptons . It ’s in pretty good shape so far . ”
91155	91158	91159	91159	Julian	88	“ Good . ”
91186	91197	91198	91198	he	88	“ By the way , you ’re good at this , ”
91201	91204	91198	91198	he	88	“ What ? ”
91205	91210	91176	91176	his	88	“ Making me happy . ”
91224	91234	91235	91235	I	1543	“ You have that touch with me , too , ”
91434	91437	91438	91438	I	1543	“ Julian ? ”
91500	91508	91509	91509	I	1543	“ Where did you just come from ? ”
91512	91540	91509	91509	I	1543	“ The last meeting . They wanted to move it up , and I did n’t want to wake you . You were smiling in your sleep . ”
91541	91545	91546	91546	I	1543	“ Was I ? ”
91554	91562	91563	91563	Julian	88	“ You were . It was cute , ”
91568	91588	91563	91563	Julian	88	“ But we have to go now . We have a flight to catch in less than an hour . ”
91593	91605	91606	91606	I	1543	“ Really ? So it ’s … all done ? Everything ? ”
91669	91675	91676	91676	he	88	“ Get dressed , Sara , ”
91689	91701	91676	91676	he	88	“ I need you ready to go as soon as possible . ”
91702	91713	91676	91676	he	88	“ Is everything okay ? Did you finalize the deal ? ”
91714	91727	91676	91676	he	88	“ All but . Everything will be finalized back in New York . ”
91728	91737	91738	91738	I	1543	“ Are n’t you happy it ’s done ? ”
91748	91751	91752	91752	Julian	88	“ Very , ”
91765	91782	91752	91752	Julian	88	“ But we can celebrate on the plane . We really do have to leave soon . ”
91843	91846	91847	91847	I	1543	“ Okay , ”
91851	91861	91847	91847	I	1543	“ I ’ll be ready to go in ten . ”
91895	91901	91884	91884	he	88	“ Stay with me tonight , ”
91983	91992	91993	91993	I	1543	“ Of course this is where you live , ”
92038	92041	92028	92028	they	1316	“ Whoa . ”
92101	92108	92109	92109	Julian	88	“ Meet me on the terrace , ”
92118	92126	92109	92109	Julian	88	“ I ’ll pour us some wine . ”
92279	92284	92289	92289	Julian	88	“ Enjoying the view ? ”
92303	92309	92310	92310	I	1543	“ How could I not ? ”
92325	92355	92310	92310	I	1543	“ Please tell me you ’re not too jaded to ever come out here , because if that ’s the case , I might actually have to smack you . ”
92359	92375	92356	92356	Julian	88	“ I ’m out here often , actually . Generally when I ca n’t sleep . ”
92376	92403	92404	92404	I	1543	“ So , what , you come out here in your velvet robe with a glass of Scotch and gaze out at Gotham like Bruce Wayne ? ”
92410	92427	92407	92407	Julian	88	“ More like a pair of sweatpants , a book , and a glass of water . ”
92428	92438	92439	92439	I	1543	“ Mm . That ’s an even sexier image , ”
92503	92511	92495	92495	Julian	88	“ I have a proposal for you . ”
92518	92521	92512	92512	I	1543	“ Hm ? ”
92522	92533	92495	92495	Julian	88	“ I want you to stay home from work tomorrow . ”
92541	92544	92534	92534	I	1543	“ Why ? ”
92545	92554	92555	92555	Julian	88	“ Because I want you to stay here , ”
92572	92593	92558	92558	his	88	“ I think I took a page from your book and developed a vivid fantasy while we were in Biarritz . ”
92594	92600	92534	92534	I	1543	“ Oh ? What fantasy ? ”
92601	92613	92558	92558	his	88	“ Coming home to you after a long day of work . ”
92619	92623	92624	92624	I	1543	“ Julian Hoult , ”
92628	92633	92624	92624	I	1543	“ That is filthy . ”
92634	92639	92640	92640	His	88	“ I ’m aware . ”
92649	92666	92640	92640	His	88	“ I ’m a bit of a sick fuck , in case you have n’t noticed . ”
92667	92692	92693	92693	I	1543	“ Mm , totally . So , tell me more about this fantasy . What am I … what am I wearing in it ? ”
92720	92746	92712	92712	God	1543	“ Honestly , I imagined everything . A robe . One of my shirts over a pair of your panties . One of my hoodies – ”
92747	92752	92753	92753	I	1543	“ You own hoodies ? ”
92757	92760	92753	92753	I	1543	“ Two . ”
92761	92775	92712	92712	God	1543	“ Let me guess , one is an Empires American League Champs hoodie . ”
92776	92779	92780	92780	Julian	88	“ Correct , ”
92783	92803	92780	92780	Julian	88	“ The other is from my days at Columbia . Probably have n’t worn it since I was nineteen . ”
92804	92816	92712	92712	God	1543	“ It ’s weird to think that you were ever nineteen . ”
92817	92827	92780	92780	Julian	88	“ Not at all sure how to take that . ”
92828	92844	92845	92845	I	1543	“ You just seem like you were always a wise , ridiculously handsome grown man , ”
92848	92859	92845	92845	I	1543	“ So in some way , that was a compliment . ”
92860	92865	92866	92866	Julian	88	“ Thank you then , ”
92986	92991	92992	92992	I	1543	“ Ca n’t sleep ? ”
93012	93015	93002	93002	I	1543	“ No . ”
93016	93028	93029	93029	I	1543	“ Is n’t this when you usually go to the terrace ? ”
93035	93038	93032	93032	He	88	“ Yes . ”
93497	93500	93501	93501	I	1543	“ Hey . ”
93542	93546	93547	93547	I	1543	“ Work okay ? ”
93759	93762	93763	93763	I	1543	“ Julian , ”
93863	93866	93867	93867	he	1	“ Sara , ”
94022	94025	94026	94026	I	1543	“ Julian , ”
94029	94038	94026	94026	I	1543	“ Oh my God . Do n’t stop . ”
94039	94046	94047	94047	he	1	“ I wo n’t , baby , ”
94050	94060	94047	94047	he	1	“ There ’s nothing I want more than you . ”
94071	94079	94080	94080	he	1	“ I think about you every night , ”
94087	94106	94107	94107	he	1	“ every morning when I wake up . I do n’t know what you ’ve done to me , ”
94110	94118	94119	94119	He	1	“ What did you do to me ? ”
94168	94173	94174	94174	I	1543	“ I love you , ”
94239	94242	94243	94243	He	1	“ Julian … ”
94313	94320	94321	94321	he	1	“ I love you , Sara , ”
94414	94420	94425	94425	he	1	“ Oh God , Julian ! ”
95329	95331	95323	95323	he	95	“ sorry ”
95430	95438	95421	95421	Julian	1	“ Oh ! This must be Sara . ”
95439	95444	95445	95445	I	1543	“ Indeed it is . ”
95546	95551	95552	95552	I	1543	“ Who was that ? ”
95613	95633	95602	95602	Julian	1	“ Grayson works with Hoult Publishing . She ’s the person who is arranging your move to Una Magazine . ”
95674	95689	95690	95690	I	1543	“ So … I ’m not going to stick around for the Roth negotiations ? ”
95693	95696	95697	95697	Julian	1	“ No , ”
95700	95705	95697	95697	Julian	1	“ You ’re not . ”
95706	95710	95658	95658	my	1543	“ Why not ? ”
95711	95752	95697	95697	Julian	1	“ The opening for this position with Una is time sensitive . It ’s a spot people are vying for , and if your goal is to work with the company , I would suggest you jump at this chance . ”
95985	95995	95996	95996	I	1543	“ Julian – what the hell is going on ? ”
96014	96043	96006	96008	Hoult Publishing International	211	“ Why are you talking to me like this ? And why do you keep mentioning Hoult International ? What do they have to do with this conversation ? ”
96050	96063	96064	96064	he	1	“ There were no open positions at Una Magazine in the States , ”
96071	96088	96064	96064	he	1	“ The position I ’m setting you up with is for Una U.K. Based in London . ”
96101	96108	96109	96109	I	1543	“ What are you talking about ? ”
96120	96134	96109	96109	I	1543	“ Julian , what are you trying to do to me right now ? ”
96135	96154	96155	96155	Julian	1	“ I ’m telling you the truth when I say there was no available position in the States , ”
96171	96187	96166	96166	he	1	“ I ca n’t have you working here anymore , Sara . I ’m sorry . ”
96188	96198	96199	96199	I	1543	“ Do n’t do this to me , Julian , ”
96205	96226	96199	96199	I	1543	“ I know you ’re in there , and I know you recognize how fucked up this is right now . ”
96255	96263	96264	96264	I	1543	“ At least give me the explanation , ”
96423	96428	96429	96429	I	1543	“ What happened yesterday ? ”
96441	96460	96461	96461	I	1543	“ Tell me what happened , because I know you meant it when you said it , Julian , ”
96477	96528	96529	96529	I	1543	“ I know you did . And yes , I entertain a lot of dreams and fantasies , but I ’m not the type to imagine things , or see something where there ’s nothing . I ’m not by nature a hopeful person – you know that by now , ”
96533	96611	96529	96529	I	1543	“ So if you refuse to let yourself feel for me anymore , then fine . I wo n’t grovel . But at least , explain to me what happened here , because you said you loved me last night , and a day later , you ’re trying to get me as far away from you as possible . You know how cruel you ’re being right now . And you know I deserve an answer . ”
96654	96667	96668	96668	he	1	“ This company is and always will be my priority , Sara , ”
96679	96712	96713	96713	He	1	“ This company is how I found my way back to my family . It takes all of me to run both this place and the stadium the way I see fit . ”
96724	96738	96739	96739	he	1	“ I ’ve never wanted something like I ’ve wanted you , Sara , ”
96748	96763	96739	96739	he	1	“ But what I want and what I need are two very different things . ”
96764	96774	96775	96775	I	1543	“ I do n’t feel like you mean that , ”
96778	96782	96783	96783	Julian	1	“ I do , ”
96790	96831	96783	96783	Julian	1	“ I ’m content around you , Sara . Borderline complacent , and I ca n’t afford that . We both need to focus on ourselves right now , Sara . We both have a lot of work to do . ”
96847	96865	96843	96843	I	1543	“ You ’re a work in progress . Too far from together for me to bother with . ”
97014	97040	97012	97013	38 JULIAN	88	“ You ’re not allowed in my suite if you do n’t have a beer . At least hold it , for Christ ’s sake . "
97081	97088	97089	97089	he	88	“ Yeah , yeah , yeah , ”
97099	97141	97142	97142	he	88	“ Technically , it ’s your suite because you own the stadium . Got that . Do n’t care . If you ’re gon na sit with me , you ’re going to at least try to have a good time , ”
97156	97162	97142	97142	he	88	“ Atta fuckin ’ asshole . ”
97163	97171	97182	97182	He	88	“ Not sure that ’s the saying . ”
97172	97181	97142	97142	he	88	“ Yeah , well it is for you . ”
97211	97245	97246	97246	Emmett	319	“ Yeah , he ’s fine . No , do n’t tell your friend to come over – trust me , that ’ll be pointless . He ’s just getting over a girl . ”
97251	97264	97246	97246	Emmett	319	“ She ’s moving to Milan today . Or was it Paris ? ”
97412	97431	97401	97401	Biarritz	117	“ For such a hard ass , you do n’t have proper control of your subordinates , Hoult . ”
97432	97441	97442	97442	I	1543	“ Do you even hear yourself , Turner ? ”
97485	97502	97476	97476	I	1543	“ Do you honestly believe that I would ask this of anyone who works for me ? ”
97503	97514	97515	97515	Turner	319	“ You could . You know well that you could , ”
97542	97580	97581	97581	Turner	319	“ You ’re Julian Hoult . You ’re like me . You have resources . You have money , possessions and connections that people wo n’t ever get in their lives even if they work their hardest , ”
97584	97688	97581	97581	Turner	319	“ Now , come on . Think of one thing you can hold over Sara ’s head . It could be as simple as her job . Just tell her you ’ll fire her if she does n’t say yes . I mean for fuck ’s sake , I ’m asking for a weekend . One weekend . And I ’ll be taking her somewhere nice . I ’m not going to fucking lock her in a dungeon – I ’ll wine and dine her and all that jazz . You just need to make it clear that I expect her to reciprocate . ”
97689	97706	97873	97873	Turner	319	“ You are out of your fucking mind , and that ’s not going to happen . ”
97707	97727	97728	97728	Turner	319	“ Then I ’m pulling out of this deal and blacklisting Empire Stadium from all future Roth Entertainment events , ”
97735	97747	97748	97748	he	319	“ Do n’t believe I ’ll do it ? Try me , ”
97751	97810	97748	97748	he	319	“ But before you do that , ask yourself if it ’s really worth it for some girl . I ’m not fucking buying her from you and turning her into my sex slave . I want to fuck her a couple times over a weekend and move on . You know me . I like the chase . ”
97811	97831	97907	97907	she	755	“ Then you ’ll love the fact that you ’ll never in your life lay a finger on Sara . ”
97832	97870	97748	97748	he	319	“ Hoult . Do n’t talk about her like she ’s some precious little sweetheart . Trust me , she has experience in this kind of thing . You do n’t know what I ’m talking about ? ”
97991	97993	97994	97994	he	319	“ itch ”
98911	98928	98929	98929	she	249	“ It ’s okay , because when you move back , you can live with me , ”
98951	98989	98929	98929	she	249	“ Lukas will move into the Hamptons home full - time . He wo n’t even mind . And if he does , then tough . That ’s what he gets for staying friends with that guy . ”
99401	99407	99408	99408	Lia	1543	“ I heard a thing , ”
99457	99463	99464	99464	I	1543	“ Can you talk louder ? ”
99467	99500	99450	99450	Lia	1543	“ No . I ’m at Lukas ’s office . He was in the conference room , and I was right outside the door when I realized he was talking to Julian . ”
99501	99511	99450	99450	Lia	1543	“ Oh my God , you said his name . ”
99512	99517	99518	99518	Lia	1543	“ Omigod ! Shit , ”
99521	99532	99518	99518	Lia	1543	“ Damn it . We had such a streak going . ”
99533	99538	99539	99539	I	1543	“ It ’s fine , ”
99825	99827	99823	99823	she	1543	“ heard ”
99845	99848	99838	99838	she	1543	“ deliberately eavesdropped ”
99852	99857	99858	99858	she	1543	“ Did you know … ”
99866	99874	99875	99875	I	1543	“ Did I know what , Lia ? ”
99878	99893	99858	99858	she	1543	“ What was the name of the place you went to in France again ? ”
99894	99897	99898	99898	I	1543	“ Biarritz , ”
99907	99915	99898	99898	I	1543	“ Why are you asking about Biarritz ? ”
99924	99939	99968	99968	Lia	1543	“ You were there to sell Julian ’s resort to those guys , right ? ”
99940	99955	99956	99956	I	1543	“ Yes . They ’re in negotiations now . They ’ll probably finish soon , ”
99975	99978	99968	99968	Lia	1543	“ Um … ”
99979	99984	99968	99968	Lia	1543	“ Lia . What ? ”
99985	99996	99968	99968	Lia	1543	“ I overheard today that that deal never went through . ”
100000	100003	99997	99997	I	1543	“ What ? ”
100004	100035	99968	99968	Lia	1543	“ The deal with the Perv Bros ? It got nixed while you guys were still in , um , Bi … Buh ... how do you say it again ? ”
100036	100039	99997	99997	I	1543	“ Biarritz . ”
100040	100070	99968	99968	Lia	1543	“ That . Anyway , I may or may not have threatened Lukas for information when we got home , under the promise that I ’d never tell you – ”
100071	100082	99997	99997	I	1543	“ Did he really believe you would n’t tell me ? ”
100083	100094	100095	100095	Lia	1543	“ No , it was probably for his own conscience , ”
100099	100201	100095	100095	Lia	1543	“ But anyway , what Lukas said was that Turner said something ‘ indecent ’ to Julian that resulted in Julian ‘ knocking him the fuck out ’ the last day you guys were there . And whichever Perv Bro he knocked out , that guy ’s still harassing him . So I guess right now , Julian and Lukas are putting their minds together to fight fire with fire . I swear to God , you give those boys a grudge to hold against someone , and they ’ll team up to annihilate you . Their brains together are scary . ”
100202	100210	100211	100211	I	1543	“ Hold up , Lia – focus , ”
100219	100238	100211	100211	I	1543	“ So Julian has n’t been doing business with the Roths this whole time I ’ve been gone ? ”
100239	100257	100095	100095	Lia	1543	“ Girl , no . Unless by doing business you mean plotting ways to kill each other . ”
100258	100261	100262	100262	I	1543	“ Shit , ”
100281	100286	100287	100287	I	1543	“ I ’m sorry , ”
100372	100379	100380	100380	I	1543	“ Fuck . I screwed him , ”
100383	100397	100380	100380	I	1543	“ You sure did , girl . On every surface at his office . ”
100398	100401	100348	100349	the men	716	“ Lia . ”
100402	100457	100380	100380	I	1543	“ Sorry , sorry . But please , please , Sara , do n’t punish me for telling you this by blaming yourself and spiraling into some dark place . I know I ’m biased here , but if this is anyone ’s fault besides those nasty Perv Bros , it ’s Julian ’s . ”
100458	100463	100348	100349	the men	716	“ Lia , stop – ”
100464	100525	100526	100526	she	1427	“ I ’m serious . He chose to hire you when he already had feelings about you – even if they were just minor then , he knew the risks that came with this . He was just cocky that he could stay professional as always . He had no idea what the fuck he was up against with you , ”
100535	100549	100348	100349	the men	716	“ You ’re taking way too much pleasure in this conversation right now . ”
100550	100575	100576	100576	she	1427	“ Only because I feel the wheels turning in your brain right now , and it ’s giving me this strange best friend ESP , ”
100579	100590	100591	100591	I	1543	“ Really . And what am I thinking right now ? ”
100594	100605	100348	100349	the men	716	“ That you need to talk to him in person . ”
100606	100609	100348	100349	the men	716	“ Fine . ”
100610	100617	100348	100349	the men	716	“ In New York . Right ? ”
100618	100621	100348	100349	the men	716	“ Yes . ”
100649	100702	100644	100644	I	1543	“ But just thinking about it scares me right now . I ca n’t handle the thought of going there , getting to his office and being told by reception that he has no time for me . Or worse , being told by Julian that he has no time for me . ”
100706	100775	100776	100776	Lia	1543	“ Look , Sara . None of this would ’ve blown up if Julian did n’t get emotionally invested in you . He could have closed the deal easy if it were n’t for the fact that he fell for you . Do you know how many other times he ’s done business by looking the other way when someone got screwed ? He ’s a ruthless asshole , ”
100779	100791	100348	100349	the men	716	“ I do n’t know where you ’re going with this . ”
100792	100846	100703	100703	Lia	1543	“ I ’m saying he probably still cares about you . At this point , we both have reason to suspect that this deal fell through because he was in some way defending you . So why are you afraid to just fly home for the weekend and get yourself some real closure ? ”
100847	100930	100348	100349	the men	716	“ Because I ’ve seen how easily Julian can flip the switch , Lia , and it ’s as hurtful as it is scary . He can go from loving one second to completely unrecognizable the next . He acts cold and distant , like he ’s never even met you . It ’s not something you can forget easily , and I ’m afraid to see it again . I ’m afraid it ’s going to hurt me all over again . ”
100931	100978	100703	100703	Lia	1543	“ Well , you stayed at June Magazine longer than you wanted because you were afraid that no other job would ever take you . Maybe you ’ll stay in London longer than you want because you ’re afraid of ever coming back to New York . ”
100979	100984	100985	100985	I	1543	“ Jesus , Lia , ”
101000	101007	100703	100703	Lia	1543	“ You know I ’m right . ”
101013	101032	101008	101008	I	1543	“ I also know you ’re doing something sketchy right now . Why are you typing so fast ? ”
101033	101037	100703	100703	Lia	1543	“ Searching flights . ”
101038	101041	101008	101008	I	1543	“ Ugh . ”
101042	101058	100703	100703	Lia	1543	“ Humor me . Tell me one good thing about Julian . Your favorite memory . ”
101059	101062	101008	101008	I	1543	“ Why ? ”
101063	101068	100703	100703	Lia	1543	“ Just do it . ”
101293	101298	101299	101299	I	1543	“ Does that suffice ? ”
101306	101335	101336	101336	she	1543	“ You tell me . I was only asking you to tell me all those stories so you ’d remind yourself what a surprisingly good guy he is , ”
101345	101362	101336	101336	she	1543	“ Are you still convinced he ’ll give you the cold shoulder if you come back ? ”
101368	101386	101363	101363	I	1543	“ No . I think he ’ll at least hear me out . Maybe even over lunch . ”
101387	101398	101363	101363	I	1543	“ He ’ll probably use that corporate voice you love . ”
101399	101402	101403	101403	I	1543	“ Ugh . ”
101409	101440	101403	101403	I	1543	“ Fuck it . Send me the links for the flight . I ’ll suck it up if he goes Corporate Julian on me . I just need the answers . ”
101441	101448	101449	101449	Lia	1543	“ You got it , girl , ”
101506	101517	101518	101518	I	1543	“ That does n’t give me time to mentally prepare , ”
101521	101532	101533	101533	she	1543	“ Mentally preparing leads to you backing out of this , ”
101536	101544	101533	101533	she	1543	“ Also , I just booked it . ”
101545	101550	101533	101533	she	1543	“ Are you kidding ? ”
101551	101557	101533	101533	she	1543	“ No . Happy birthday . ”
101558	101565	101533	101533	she	1543	“ It ’s not my birthday . ”
101566	101590	101591	101591	Lia	1543	“ Happy Fourth of July then , I do n’t know ! Are n’t you excited to see me as soon as tomorrow ? ”
101594	101607	101591	101591	Lia	1543	“ It ’s been five weeks since I ’ve smelled your hair . ”
101608	101611	101533	101533	she	1543	“ Creepy . ”
101612	101633	101591	101591	Lia	1543	“ Girl , you do n’t even know how creepy I can get . I ’ve missed you too much ! ”
101652	101660	101661	101661	I	1543	“ Oh God . It ’s happening , ”
101673	101691	101661	101661	I	1543	“ Departing tomorrow at seven forty - five in the morning ? Are you joking , Lia ? ”
101692	101708	101709	101709	she	1543	“ Again , not giving you time to think twice about this . Still scared ? ”
101712	101718	101661	101661	I	1543	“ More so , actually . ”
101719	101776	101661	101661	I	1543	“ Do n’t worry about it . Just start winding down for bed now , because you got ta get up early . And no matter what you do , do n’t freak out . Whatever happens with that asshole , at least you ’ll get closure . And at least I ’ll always love you . ”
102109	102118	102119	102120	a man	875	“ Would you like a seat , miss ? ”
102130	102143	102144	102144	I	1543	“ Oh , no , thank you . It ’s not heavy , ”
102381	102384	102385	102391	The man who ’d offered his seat	1446	“ Miss ? ”
102423	102428	102429	102429	I	1543	“ I ’m sorry , ”
102696	102701	102702	102702	I	1543	“ You ’re here , ”
102706	102711	102712	102712	he	1446	“ I ’m here , ”
102765	102771	102772	102772	I	1543	“ How did you … ? ”
102809	102816	102820	102820	His	1446	“ What are you doing here ? ”
102827	102835	102820	102820	His	1446	“ I came to take you home . ”
102847	102852	102853	102853	I	1543	“ Did Lia … ? ”
102856	102865	102866	102866	Julian	88	“ Send me your flight information ? Yes , ”
102912	102928	102937	102937	he	88	“ I did n’t realize the deal fell through , Julian . I would ’ve – ”
102929	102936	102937	102937	he	88	“ Do n’t worry about that , ”
102952	102965	102937	102937	he	88	“ That was the last thing I wanted you to think about . ”
102971	102982	102983	102983	I	1543	“ You worked so hard for that deal , Julian , ”
102990	103008	102983	102983	I	1543	“ It could n’t have been easy for you to let go of . I know that . ”
103009	103025	102983	102983	I	1543	“ It was n’t . But it was still easier than letting go of you . ”
103076	103109	103110	103110	he	88	“ You had to know I did n’t want to let you go , Sara . I wanted to keep you for as long as you ’d have me . I swear , ”
103124	103134	103135	103135	he	88	“ I got so fucking addicted to that smile , ”
103138	103154	103135	103135	he	88	“ I hated watching you leave . I just thought it was for the best . ”
103155	103171	103172	103172	I	1543	“ I ’ve told you a million times you do n’t have to protect me , ”
103175	103213	103172	103172	I	1543	“ I do n’t know what Turner said to you that night , but considering what I ’ve heard him say about me , both in front of me and behind my back , I can guess . ”
103214	103242	103243	103243	Julian	1	“ He wanted me to force your compliance , Sara . He wanted me to threaten your job unless you agreed to spend a weekend with him , ”
103267	103327	103328	103328	Julian	1	“ People who work for him found out about your arrest . I was afraid he would hold it over you , and harass you . I did n’t know how that would affect you , Sara , and I was n’t going to assume . Not when it involved something that hurt you so bad in the past , ”
103338	103356	103328	103328	Julian	1	“ I just wanted you to keep healing . You said yourself it ’s a fragile process . ”
103357	103378	103379	103379	Julian	1	“ It is . But it ’s even harder without the man who helped me start in the first place . ”
103467	103480	103481	103481	I	1543	“ I promise you I ’m going to be okay , Julian , ”
103489	103509	103481	103481	I	1543	“ I can do anything on my own , but with you , I do it that much better . ”
103593	103609	103610	103610	Julian	1	“ God , you have no idea how much I ’ve missed you , Sara , ”
103628	103640	103620	103620	He	1	“ I dreamt of you every day that you were gone . ”
103656	103666	103667	103667	JULIAN	1	“ Trust me . I know how that feels . ”
103876	103890	103891	103891	she	1460	“ How long do you think I ’ll be staying at your apartment ? ”
103910	103916	103901	103901	She	1460	“ My guess is awhile . ”
104382	104389	104390	104390	I	1543	“ What … is going on ? ”
104482	104488	104472	104472	He	1	“ Come here , baby . ”
104565	104576	104577	104577	I	1543	“ Julian Hoult . Are you taking me to prom ? ”
104593	104618	104619	104619	he	1	“ We covered the motorcycle ride on your wish list . We ’ve been to your french fry spot about a dozen times now , ”
104628	104642	104619	104619	he	1	“ Figured we should cross off prom before we get to the rest . ”
104643	104647	104648	104648	I	1543	“ Fair enough , ”
104670	104676	104651	104651	he	1	“ You Are The Best Thing ”
104685	104701	104702	104702	I	1543	“ But you realize you ’ve set a bad precedent for yourself here , right ? ”
104714	104718	104702	104702	I	1543	“ How so ? ”
104719	104738	104702	104702	I	1543	“ You remember that wish list right ? Now you have to take me to Monaco and Tuscany . ”
104739	104768	104702	104702	I	1543	“ Not a problem . Remind me what else is on that wish list ? Because I ’m actually going to get to another part of it tonight . ”
104774	104799	104769	104769	I	1543	“ Really , Mr. Hoult . That ’s interesting , since the rest of that wish list is entirely up to me to complete . ”
104800	104813	104702	104702	I	1543	“ Something about buying your parents a three - bedroom in London . ”
104814	104825	104826	104826	I	1543	“ Yes . And trust me , I ’m saving , ”
104958	104971	104972	104972	I	1543	“ So where are you taking me tonight ? Monaco or Tuscany ? ”
104986	104997	104998	104998	I	1543	“ And do Lukas and Lia know about the trip ? ”
105001	105016	104998	104998	I	1543	“ Because they ’re kind of expecting us at our reservation in thirty minutes . ”
105017	105033	105065	105065	Julian	88	“ I ’m sorry , baby , but we ’re not leaving the country tonight . ”
105034	105064	104998	104998	I	1543	“ But you said we were covering another part of the wish list tonight , and I do n’t see myself buying a house for my parents before midnight . ”
105127	105130	105131	105131	His	88	“ Julian … ”
105141	105182	105183	105183	Julian	88	“ You said you wanted to buy a three - bedroom for your parents , so you could visit with your kids . And I kind of imagined from the day you said it that they would be our kids , ”
105214	105297	105298	105298	he	1485	“ Sara , you ’ve been everything I ’ve ever wanted from the moment I laid eyes on you , and every day I spend with you , I find myself wanting more . I want to bring you to Monaco and Tuscany . I want to see you walk down the aisle to me in a big white dress . I want to see the way your eyes light up around our children . I think you rubbed off on me , ”
105301	105369	105298	105298	he	1485	“ because all I do these days is fantasize about you , and us and the life we ’re going to have together . You make me want to be a better man , and the best father in the world . For all the ways you ’ve changed my life , and all the happiness you ’ve brought me , you deserve nothing short of that . ”
105409	105437	105438	105438	he	88	“ Making you happy has been by far my proudest achievement , Sara . And I ’ll never stop working to keep that smile on your face , ”
105455	105472	105438	105438	he	88	“ So marry me . I ’ve been waiting for awhile to call you my wife . ”
105473	105481	105482	105482	I	1543	“ Of course I ’ll marry you , ”
105521	105525	105503	105503	His	88	“ Sara Hoult , ”
105539	105543	105532	105532	he	88	“ Sounds perfect . ”
105544	105548	105503	105503	His	88	“ It does . ”
105626	105630	105624	105624	he	88	“ I love you ”
