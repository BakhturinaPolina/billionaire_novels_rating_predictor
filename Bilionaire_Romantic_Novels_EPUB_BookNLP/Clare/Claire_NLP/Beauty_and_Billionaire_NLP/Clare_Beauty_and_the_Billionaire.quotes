220	225	241	243	The other woman	169	“ It ’s lovely . ”
226	240	241	243	The other woman	169	“ Some dead celebrity ’s home or something . I do n’t care . ”
259	285	254	254	her	169	“ All I care about is how we ’re supposed to get these damned boxes back to SoHo . What the heck was Audrey thinking ? ”
286	293	254	254	her	169	“ Could we call a cab ? ”
390	399	400	401	the redhead	172	“ I do n’t know about a cab , ”
404	420	400	401	the redhead	172	“ That ’ll clean us out , and I still want to order that pizza . ”
421	424	425	429	the dark - haired one	174	“ So ? ”
432	435	436	437	the redhead	172	“ Brontë , ”
463	481	457	458	the redhead	172	“ You have to understand something about my sister . She ’s not the most practical creature . ”
482	493	436	437	the redhead	172	“ She ’s not ? She seems practical to me . ”
494	544	545	545	She	172	“ Not when it comes to work . She thinks we ’re mules or something , as evidenced by all this . And if I need to call and gripe at her to get her in line , then , by golly , I ’m going to do it . ”
564	594	558	558	she	172	“ Voice mail . I ca n’t believe her . She said there were two boxes . Not five boxes of hardbacks . Does she think we ’re bodybuilders ? ”
595	602	603	604	the brunette	172	“ It ’s not that bad , ”
615	623	603	604	the brunette	172	“ I ’m sure we can manage . ”
624	630	631	632	the redhead	172	“ I blame Logan Hawkings , ”
640	654	631	632	the redhead	172	“ He thinks the world just belongs to him , does n’t he ? ”
666	670	658	660	the other woman	169	“ I suppose . ”
671	694	603	604	the brunette	172	“ Ugh . Look at that hang - dog expression . You ’re still in love with him , are n’t you ? ”
704	736	695	696	The brunette	172	“ ‘ I hate and I love . Perhaps you ask why I do so . I do not know , but I feel it , and am in agony . ’ ”
737	763	695	696	The brunette	172	“ Oh , quit quoting that crap at me . You ’re being dramatic . He ’s a jerk . You ’ll get over him . ”
828	861	820	820	she	172	“ Save me from rich , attractive alpha males . They think they ’re the heroes from a fairy tale . Little do they know , they ’re more like the villains . ”
862	870	874	874	Brontë	172	“ That ’s not fair , Gretchen , ”
877	883	884	884	Gretchen	503	“ Life ’s not fair , ”
892	918	884	884	Gretchen	503	“ I ’d rather have a man who is n’t in love with his own reflection than one who needs hair product or designer labels . ”
943	967	884	884	Gretchen	503	“ So you ’d rather have a pizza guy with a weak chin and a knight - in - shining - armor complex ? ”
968	971	972	972	Gretchen	503	“ Yes , ”
986	998	972	972	Gretchen	503	“ His looks are n’t half as important as his brain . ”
1287	1292	1293	1293	Logan	25	“ What is it ? ”
1296	1306	1293	1293	Logan	25	“ I ’m about to head into a meeting . ”
1307	1326	1327	1327	Hunter	29	“ There ca n’t be more than one ‘ Brontë ’ running around New York , can there ? ”
1343	1346	1347	1347	Logan	25	“ Brontë ? ”
1353	1362	1347	1347	Logan	25	“ You saw her ? Where is she ? ”
1387	1405	1363	1363	Hunter	29	“ She just left with a redhead named Gretchen . I want to know more about her . ”
1406	1411	1412	1412	Logan	25	“ About my Brontë ? ”
1419	1434	1412	1412	Logan	25	“ No . Gretchen . The one with red hair . I want her . ”
1435	1438	1412	1412	Logan	25	“ Oh . ”
1443	1469	1412	1412	Logan	25	“ Sorry , man . Have n’t been myself lately . She left me , and I ’ve been going crazy trying to find her . ”
1478	1494	1470	1470	Logan	25	“ I ca n’t believe she ’s still in New York . Where are you ? ”
1495	1505	1506	1506	Hunter	29	“ At the townhouse on the Upper East Side . ”
1567	1580	1581	1581	Hunter	29	“ Your assistant did n’t come by to pick up the boxes , ”
1587	1599	1581	1581	Hunter	29	“ This Gretchen did , and your Brontë was with her . ”
1600	1606	1607	1607	Logan	25	“ I have to go , ”
1610	1622	1607	1607	Logan	25	“ I ’ll call Audrey and see who she sent over . ”
1623	1632	1633	1633	Hunter	29	“ Send me information about this Gretchen woman , ”
1641	1648	1649	1649	Logan	25	“ I will . And thanks . ”
1659	1665	1649	1649	Logan	25	“ I owe you one . ”
1666	1670	1671	1671	Hunter	29	“ You do , ”
1674	1690	1671	1671	Hunter	29	“ Just get me information on her friend , and we ’ll call it even . ”
2273	2306	2254	2255	the redhead	172	“ Save me from rich , attractive alpha males . They think they ’re the heroes from a fairy tale . Little do they know , they ’re more like the villains . ”
2316	2320	2321	2321	he	29	“ Your friend , ”
2326	2335	2321	2321	he	29	“ The redhead . Tell me about her . ”
2355	2360	2336	2336	She	172	“ You mean Gretchen ? ”
2361	2364	2365	2365	He	29	“ Yes . ”
2380	2387	2365	2365	He	29	“ What is her last name ? ”
2388	2398	2336	2336	She	172	“ Why ? How do you know about Gretchen ? ”
2399	2415	2365	2365	He	29	“ I saw her with you the other day . Tell me more about her . ”
2421	2436	2416	2416	She	172	“ Why should I tell you about Gretchen ? So you can stalk her ? ”
2465	2478	2458	2459	a man	180	“ I am an admirer of hers . . . from afar . ”
2479	2484	2458	2459	a man	180	“ Like a stalker . ”
2485	2499	2458	2459	a man	180	“ Not a stalker . I simply wish to know more about her . ”
2500	2509	2458	2459	a man	180	“ That ’s what a stalker would say . ”
2540	2560	2536	2536	He	29	“ Your friend is quite safe from my romantic interests . I simply wish to learn more about her . ”
2601	2604	2605	2605	Brontë	172	“ Oh , ”
2617	2630	2605	2605	Brontë	172	“ Petty . Her last name is Petty . She writes books . ”
2654	2660	2644	2645	Gretchen Petty	503	“ What kinds of books ? ”
2661	2671	2698	2698	Brontë	172	“ Books with other people ’s names on them . ”
2692	2697	2682	2682	she	172	“ A ghost writer ? ”
2701	2714	2698	2698	Brontë	172	“ That ’s right . And Cooper ’s in love with her . ”
2715	2722	2698	2698	Brontë	172	“ Cooper ? Who is Cooper ? ”
2749	2792	2798	2798	she	172	“ Cooper ’s her friend . It ’s okay , though . He wo n’t make a move . He knows Gretchen is n’t interested in him that way . Gretchen likes guys who are different . She likes to be challenged . ”
2889	2893	2894	2894	he	25	“ Gretchen Petty , ”
3045	3069	3041	3041	She	220	“ I ’d rather have a man not in love with his own reflection than one that needs hair product or designer labels . ”
4391	4411	4381	4382	Gretchen Petty	503	“ Do you suppose if I take enough of these home , it ’ll make me a decent dinner ? ”
4432	4442	4416	4417	Kat Garvey	53	“ Stop it . You ’re not that broke . ”
4443	4449	4450	4450	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m almost there , ”
4465	4481	4450	4450	Gretchen	503	“ The cupboard ’s bare , and I ’m weeks away from an acceptance payment . ”
4482	4494	4495	4495	Kat	53	“ So I take it lunch is on me this time ? ”
4509	4523	4499	4499	Gretchen	503	“ Why , Kat . It is so generous of you to offer . ”
4524	4544	4499	4499	Gretchen	503	“ Do n’t thank me . I ’m taking it directly off the top of your next royalty check . ”
4545	4555	4499	4499	Gretchen	503	“ In that case , I ’m ordering dessert . ”
4641	4662	4663	4663	Kat	53	“ So how ’s the book coming , Gretchen ? As your agent , I ’m obligated to ask you . ”
4671	4681	4663	4663	Kat	53	“ I know it ’s not your favorite project . ”
4682	4690	4691	4691	Gretchen	503	“ Favorite would be a grand overstatement , ”
4702	4721	4691	4691	Gretchen	503	“ Something more like ‘ greatest torture known to mankind ’ would probably be closer to the mark . ”
4725	4729	4722	4722	Kat	53	“ That well ? ”
4803	4821	4826	4826	Gretchen	503	“ Are we on track to turn in at the end of the month , at least ? ”
4822	4825	4826	4826	Gretchen	503	“ Mmmmmsure . ”
4841	4852	4826	4826	Gretchen	503	“ Or a week or so after . Maybe two . ”
4853	4856	4857	4857	Kat	53	“ Gretchen , ”
4862	4880	4857	4857	Kat	53	“ Are you serious ? This is the fourth project you ’ve been late on this year . ”
4936	4947	4948	4948	Gretchen	503	“ I had to do a lot of science research , ”
4951	4994	4948	4948	Gretchen	503	“ For Astronaut Bill and the Space Vixens of Dark Planet ? Are you kidding me ? It ’s pulp , Gretchen ! Granted , it ’s pulp with a huge following , but it ’s still freaking pulp . Just write . ”
4995	5005	5138	5138	She	503	“ Yeah , but have you read those books ? ”
5009	5014	5006	5006	Kat	53	“ Not my type . ”
5015	5078	5006	5006	Kat	53	“ Yeah , well that makes two of us . I had to read a few of them , too . And you know what happens in Astronaut Bill Conquers the Moon Maidens ? He razes the planet of all greenery . All greenery , Kat ! How the hell are they supposed to breathe if there ’s nothing to produce oxygen ? ”
5079	5085	5086	5086	Kat	53	“ It ’s space fantasy . ”
5094	5104	5086	5086	Kat	53	“ Write in some robot oxygen makers or something . ”
5105	5113	5114	5114	Gretchen	503	“ But it has to make sense , ”
5117	5137	5114	5114	Gretchen	503	“ I ca n’t just phone it in . I ca n’t write loopholes like that in the story . ”
5223	5262	5213	5214	Astronaut Bill	42	“ I do n’t know why you get so hung up on that misogynistic crap , Gretchen . Just finish the book and have the copyeditor fill in the holes . That ’s what they ’re there for . ”
5269	5293	5263	5263	Gretchen	503	“ You know if you turn in late again , they wo n’t re - up your contract . You need this contract . ”
5294	5306	5263	5263	Gretchen	503	“ I know . I ’m just . . . struggling . ”
5419	5440	5383	5383	she	503	“ Just tell them I ’m sick . Maybe someone died and I had to leave town for the funeral . ”
5446	5469	5441	5441	Kat	53	“ I ’m not going to lie about your family . I ’ll just tell them you need another week , max . ”
5470	5473	5441	5441	Kat	53	“ Two ? ”
5474	5478	5479	5479	Kat	53	“ One week , ”
5483	5499	5479	5479	Kat	53	“ But you know they run on tight deadlines and they wo n’t be happy . ”
5500	5504	5505	5505	Gretchen	503	“ I know , ”
5527	5537	5505	5505	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll get it finished , I promise . ”
5538	5570	5441	5441	Kat	53	“ Gretchen , you know I adore you , girl . You ’re my favorite client . But I say this with love — you need to get your act together . ”
5571	5579	5505	5505	Gretchen	503	“ Consider it together . I promise . ”
5587	5606	5580	5580	Kat	53	“ Well , did you want to hear about another ghostwriting contract ? They asked for you specifically . ”
5607	5610	5611	5611	Gretchen	503	“ Me ? ”
5618	5622	5611	5611	Gretchen	503	“ You serious ? ”
5623	5644	5645	5645	Her	503	“ Yeah , I do n’t know . Do you have connections at any publishers I do n’t know about ? ”
5651	5658	5645	5645	Her	503	“ Especially brand - new ones ? ”
5659	5665	5611	5611	Gretchen	503	“ Brand - new ones ? ”
5666	5711	5645	5645	Her	503	“ Yeah , someone ’s launching a small publishing line . I do n’t know anything about it other than they headhunted one of the best editors I know to head it up , and for their launch title they want you on board . ”
5723	5729	5611	5611	Gretchen	503	“ I do n’t understand . ”
5730	5763	5611	5611	Gretchen	503	“ Me either , kiddo . But they were very clear that they wanted you on this project . Said you had a reputation for ghostwriting and they wanted you on board . ”
5916	5930	5908	5908	Gretchen	503	“ So what kind of job is it and what does it pay ? ”
5931	5938	5908	5908	Gretchen	503	“ It pays three hundred grand . ”
5947	5957	5939	5939	Gretchen	503	“ Three . . . hundred grand ? Seriously ? ”
5958	5970	5908	5908	Gretchen	503	“ So I ’m told . Lead title , you know . ”
5971	5990	5939	5939	Gretchen	503	“ And this is a legit publisher ? Really ? They ’re putting out that kind of money ? ”
5991	6021	5908	5908	Gretchen	503	“ Yeah . Weird terms , though . Ten percent up front , ninety percent upon turn in of an acceptable manuscript . And that ’s not the weirdest . ”
6069	6075	6062	6062	her	503	“ What else is weird ? ”
6087	6096	6081	6081	She	53	“ Well , there are unusual working terms . ”
6097	6112	6076	6076	Kat	53	“ Uh - oh . Am I going to like the sound of this ? ”
6113	6225	6081	6081	She	53	“ Probably not , which is why I did n’t mention it when we first sat down . It ’s strange , Gretch . Really strange . Apparently the project they want you to do is an epistolary novel of sorts . There ’s some old letters someone found in an attic of a very old , very famous mansion . The publisher said the letters were really romantic , so they ’re seeing this as some sort of quasi Anne Frank meets The Notebook sort of project . They think it ’ll be huge . But there ’s a catch . You ca n’t take the letters off the property . ”
6226	6240	6241	6241	She	53	“ Okay , that ’s a little picky , but do - able . ”
6277	6286	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ Who ’s name am I writing under ? ”
6287	6307	6081	6081	She	53	“ Do n’t know yet . They did n’t want to release it until the project was agreed upon . ”
6308	6315	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ So where ’s this house ? ”
6316	6319	6320	6320	Kat	53	“ Mansion , ”
6323	6331	6320	6320	Kat	53	“ And it ’s in Hyde Park . ”
6337	6346	6332	6332	Her	53	“ Like . . . the Vanderbilt one ? ”
6347	6364	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ Close . You know the one with the white columns and the crazy rose gardens ? ”
6365	6379	6332	6332	Her	53	“ Holy shit . Yes , I know that one . Buchanan Manor . ”
6380	6395	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ That ’s the one . And that ’s the location of our letters . ”
6396	6402	6403	6403	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s so cool , ”
6408	6417	6403	6403	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m totally in on this project . ”
6418	6428	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ I think you need to think about it . ”
6429	6458	6403	6403	Gretchen	503	“ Why ? The money ’s awesome , the house is fascinating , and it ’s a lead title . What is it you ’re not telling me ? ”
6459	6480	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ It ’s the house . You heard the part about the letters not being able to leave the premises ? ”
6481	6520	6403	6403	Gretchen	503	“ Yeah , but what ’s the big deal ? I ’ll just drop in on some weekdays and take photos . I do n’t mind going on location if the pay is right — which it is . ”
6521	6595	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ You ’re going to be very on location . As in , if you take the job , they want you to live on site for the duration of the project . They do n’t want you coming back and forth . The owner ’s a bit of a recluse and does n’t seem to like traffic much , so he ’s insisting that the ghostwriter live on the premises with him . ”
6596	6600	6403	6403	Gretchen	503	“ Do what ? ”
6601	6624	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ Live . On site . With the owner . He ’s the one who does n’t want them leaving the premises . ”
6625	6633	6403	6403	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s a little . . . ”
6634	6657	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ Creepy ? I know . That ’s what I said and that ’s why I think you should turn it down . ”
6695	6705	6260	6262	a new publisher	290	“ Exactly how many letters are there , again ? ”
6706	6710	6711	6711	Kat	53	“ Several hundred . ”
6718	6728	6711	6711	Kat	53	“ You ’re not considering it , are you ? ”
6729	6733	6734	6734	she	53	“ Not seriously , ”
6737	6768	6734	6734	she	53	“ Though it would be cool to visit the house and see what it ’s like on the inside . And the money would be nice . But . . . ”
6769	6792	6828	6828	Kat	53	“ Yeah , it ’s that ‘ but ’ that makes me keep pausing . You want me to turn them down ? ”
6823	6827	6793	6793	Gretchen	503	“ Not yet . ”
6831	6835	6828	6828	Kat	53	“ Suit yourself . ”
6862	6871	6828	6828	Kat	53	“ And they asked for me , huh ? ”
6872	6887	6828	6828	Kat	53	“ Who knows . Maybe the recluse is a big fan of Astronaut Bill . ”
6920	6927	6907	6907	Gretchen	503	“ You going to eat that ? ”
6931	6947	6948	6949	Astronaut Bill	42	“ Never worry , Uranea . I ’ll stop them with my trusty laser sword . ”
6977	6987	6971	6971	Her	49	“ Oh , please be safe , Astronaut Bill ! ”
6988	6997	6998	6998	Bill	42	“ They wo n’t know what hit them , ”
7022	7041	7010	7010	Uranea	49	“ Now I ’ll send them on a one - way ticket back to the stars . . . ”
7249	7261	7229	7229	Cooper	328	“ I ’ll get it , Gretch . You ’re busy . ”
7554	7561	7562	7562	he	312	“ How ’s the book coming ? ”
7565	7571	7562	7562	he	312	“ Still giving you trouble ? ”
7596	7606	7607	7607	she	172	“ Oh , just struggling with a love scene , ”
7611	7618	7607	7607	she	172	“ You know how it goes . ”
7740	7752	7753	7753	she	172	“ Actually , I need to get this scene knocked out , ”
7773	7789	7765	7765	she	172	“ If it ’s okay with you , I ’m going to head out early . ”
7790	7794	7795	7795	Cooper	328	“ Of course , ”
7798	7811	7795	7795	Cooper	328	“ Oh , and I wanted to talk to you about something . ”
7946	7978	7939	7939	he	326	“ Can it wait , Coop ? I really do need to get going . The cookies will be ready in a few minutes , if you can pull them out . ”
7979	8002	8003	8003	She	172	“ Oh , sure . I was just going to let you know that I think you ’ll like your next check . ”
8009	8012	8003	8003	She	172	“ Why ? ”
8018	8025	8013	8013	He	326	“ I gave you a raise . ”
8026	8038	8013	8013	He	326	“ A raise ? Why ? I ’m your worst employee . ”
8039	8051	8013	8013	He	326	“ Do n’t say that . You ’re my favorite employee . ”
8096	8138	8157	8157	She	503	“ You should n’t give me a raise , Coop . Anyone else would have fired me at this point . I ’m late , I ’m lazy , and I work on other stuff when I ’m tending the counter . ”
8139	8156	8157	8157	She	503	“ Yes , but you make an incredible cookie . All the customers love your recipes . ”
8160	8175	8157	8157	She	503	“ Did you not hear me say the part about being late and lazy ? ”
8176	8184	8157	8157	She	503	“ Yes , but you work hard . ”
8185	8197	8157	8157	She	503	“ On my books , yes . Not on slinging coffee . ”
8201	8214	8198	8198	He	235	“ You should n’t tell me that . I ’m your boss . ”
8215	8221	8222	8222	she	503	“ You ’re my friend , ”
8244	8262	8263	8263	she	503	“ Actually , I wanted to tell you that I might be scarce for a few weeks , ”
8300	8316	8297	8297	her	53	“ I just got handed another contract and it ’s an on - location one . ”
8317	8320	8321	8321	He	235	“ Oh ? ”
8325	8333	8321	8321	He	235	“ I ’ll miss seeing you around . ”
8334	8339	8340	8340	She	503	“ Yeah , well . ”
8352	8369	8340	8340	She	503	“ I ’m sorry . Debbie always wants more shifts . Can you give her mine ? ”
8370	8373	8374	8374	he	235	“ Hey , ”
8390	8413	8374	8374	he	235	“ Do n’t stress . You do what needs to be done . You know I ’ll always be here for you . ”
8417	8434	8414	8414	Gretchen	503	“ Thanks , Cooper . You ’re a good friend . I really do mean that . ”
8435	8441	8449	8449	his	235	“ I know you do . ”
8503	8517	8487	8487	Cooper	328	“ I appreciate it , Cooper . Sorry to run out on you . ”
8518	8523	8524	8524	he	235	“ Not a problem , ”
8555	8563	8564	8564	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m going to head out , ”
8572	8579	8564	8564	Gretchen	503	“ See you around , Coop . ”
8640	8644	8624	8624	she	503	“ Kat Geary . ”
8645	8663	8624	8624	she	503	“ It ’s me . Is that weird - ass job at the Buchanan place still available ? ”
8664	8677	8624	8624	she	503	“ You ’re not seriously thinking about taking it , are you ? ”
8678	8683	8624	8624	she	503	“ I sure am . ”
8774	8796	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ I could use a distraction and this project sounds like the perfect one . When do I get to start ? ”
8797	8821	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ As soon as we get a handshake on it . Gretchen , are you sure ? It means living on the premises . ”
8822	8839	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ Yeah , but I ’ve seen the outside of the house . It ’s huge . ”
8840	8854	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ What if it ’s filled with coffins and decapitated doll heads inside ? ”
8855	8909	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ Jeez , Kat . You been trolling through the horror fiction section lately ? It ’s a mansion . I ’m sure it ’ll be fine . It ’s probably so big that I wo n’t see anyone ever . It ’ll just be me and some dusty library . No big . ”
8917	8944	8910	8910	Kat	53	“ Well , as your friend , I think you ’re crazy . As your agent , I just want to say thanks for the commission . ”
8945	8970	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ You ’re welcome . I think . Now , can you call my Astronaut Bill editor and tell her I need an extension ? ”
8993	9018	8973	8973	Gretchen	503	“ Holy doughnuts . This place is insane . I ca n’t believe I ’m going to be living here for the next month . ”
9019	9028	9033	9034	her sister	299	“ I ca n’t believe it , either . ”
9043	9061	9033	9034	her sister	299	“ The money is good , but I still think you ’re crazy for taking this job . ”
9072	9090	9062	9062	Gretchen	503	“ It ’s a pretty lucrative job , Audrey . And you did n’t have to come . ”
9098	9216	9091	9092	Her sister	299	“ Oh , yes I did . You have n’t met Buchanan . I have . He ’s surly and unpleasant and that house is a mausoleum . It ’s bad enough that you ’re taking a job that forces you to live in someone else ’s home . I do n’t care if he ’s Mr. Hawkings ’s best friend — I’m not letting you shack up without checking out the place first . That ’s so they know you have someone looking out for you . I do n’t want to have you disappear for a month and then we ’re calling the news and insisting that someone digs up the gardens looking for you . ”
9222	9231	9217	9217	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll probably never see the man . ”
9240	9258	9232	9232	Audrey	26	“ Do n’t argue with me . You know I ’m the responsible one in this family . ”
9308	9341	9400	9400	Spoilsport	56	“ I do n’t think they ’d bury me in the backyard , Audrey . Did you see the landscaping ? It probably costs more than we both make in a month . ”
9342	9348	9349	9349	Audrey	26	“ If you need money , ”
9358	9366	9367	9367	Gretchen	503	“ It ’s not just the money , ”
9370	9386	9367	9367	Gretchen	503	“ It ’s an adventure . Have n’t you ever wanted to have an adventure ? ”
9387	9399	9400	9400	Spoilsport	56	“ Not if it involves living with a stranger , no . ”
9432	9449	9367	9367	Gretchen	503	“ Look at the size of this place . Odds are that I never see him . ”
9672	9677	9659	9659	Gretchen	503	“ This is uncomfortable . ”
9691	9698	9678	9678	Audrey	26	“ Where ’s all your bravery ? ”
9699	9717	9678	9678	Audrey	26	“ I did n’t realize I was going to be living at frickin ’ Hogwarts ! I — ”
9799	9803	9804	9805	the man	1396	“ Good afternoon , ”
9812	9822	9804	9805	the man	1396	“ Which one of you is Ms. Gretchen Petty ? ”
9828	9831	9832	9832	She	26	“ Here . ”
9847	9868	9832	9832	She	26	“ I brought my sister for the weekend so she can see me settled . I hope that ’s okay ? ”
9900	9954	9888	9888	Audrey	26	“ My employer is Logan Hawkings , a friend of Mr. Buchanan ’s . When I told Mr. Hawkings that we would be coming here for the weekend , he told me that he had cleared it with Mr. Buchanan and that it would not be a problem for me to tag along . ”
10032	10057	10028	10029	the man	1396	“ I am aware of Mr. Hawkings ’s involvement . If you would please follow me , I can show you to your rooms . ”
10080	10085	10086	10086	Gretchen	503	“ No , no , ”
10090	10117	10118	10118	She	503	“ Do n’t bother . I can carry all the bags . There are Amazons in my ancestry , after all . Me strong like bull . ”
10145	10151	10133	10133	Audrey	26	“ Shut up , already . ”
10163	10185	10152	10152	Gretchen	503	“ Come on . The world ’s friendliest butler there does n’t look like he ’s going to wait on us . ”
10272	10278	10259	10259	Gretchen	503	“ This place is gorgeous . ”
10293	10299	10282	10282	them	360	“ Of course it is . ”
10300	10312	10279	10282	The gentleman escorting them	365	“ I was n’t insulting the place , I was just — ”
10313	10321	10322	10322	He	365	“ Talking . Yes , I noticed . ”
10363	10376	10377	10377	Gretchen	503	“ Gee , I hope he ’s in charge of the tour , ”
10382	10391	10377	10377	Gretchen	503	“ He ’s got some incredible people skills . ”
10457	10467	10469	10469	he	367	“ I have prepared only one room for guests . ”
10477	10486	10487	10487	Gretchen	503	“ Oh , it ’s not a problem , ”
10491	10517	10487	10487	Gretchen	503	“ It must be terribly difficult to find space around here . You must only have thirty or forty guest bedrooms . I totally understand . ”
10647	10656	10657	10658	the butler	367	“ I trust that this suits your needs ? ”
10677	10684	10685	10685	she	503	“ It ’s a little small , ”
10688	10694	10685	10685	she	503	“ but it ’ll suit . ”
10695	10720	10662	10662	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll give you a few hours to get settled . Dinner is in two hours and will be brought to your room . ”
10735	10745	10721	10721	Audrey	26	“ Do we get a tour of the place ? ”
10746	10751	10752	10752	Gretchen	503	“ And the letters , ”
10755	10765	10752	10752	Gretchen	503	“ When do I get to look at those ? ”
10766	10784	10785	10785	He	367	“ The letters are in the south wing , and the south wing is off limits today . ”
10795	10819	10785	10785	He	367	“ If you need anything else , ring the bell pull . My name is Mr. Eldon . You can ask for me . ”
10820	10829	10830	10830	Gretchen	503	“ Why is the south wing off limits ? ”
10840	10846	10847	10847	he	367	“ Because today is Friday , ”
10871	10882	10883	10883	Audrey	26	“ Well . The rich do surround themselves with eccentrics , ”
10886	10900	10883	10883	Audrey	26	“ Maybe he ’s very good at being a butler . Or something . ”
10901	10918	10919	10919	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m hoping it ’s more along the lines of ‘ old family friend ’ , ”
10923	10949	10919	10919	Gretchen	503	“ Because that ’ll excuse his behavior a little more . Do you think the owner does n’t want me here to do this project ? ”
10950	10956	10957	10957	Audrey	26	“ I do n’t know , ”
10979	11003	10957	10957	Audrey	26	“ They invited you here , did n’t they ? So the Buchanan family must be aware that you ’re here to work . ”
11004	11007	11008	11008	Gretchen	503	“ Huh . ”
11147	11159	11137	11137	Eldon	61	“ She is here , and she is settled , sir . ”
11183	11189	11160	11160	Hunter	29	“ Did she seem pleased ? ”
11201	11223	11190	11191	The butler	367	“ Pleased ? I suppose . She asked to see the letters and I told her the wing was off limits . ”
11224	11231	11190	11191	The butler	367	“ You can show her tomorrow . ”
11232	11241	11190	11191	The butler	367	“ Shall I leave the honor to you ? ”
11242	11252	11190	11191	The butler	367	“ I . . . no . Not yet . ”
11292	11300	11273	11273	she	503	“ I shall introduce myself in time . ”
11301	11307	11308	11308	Eldon	61	“ Very well , sir . ”
11322	11327	11273	11273	she	503	“ What is it ? ”
11328	11337	11273	11273	she	503	“ She has brought her sister with her . ”
11338	11344	11273	11273	she	503	“ I have no objections . ”
11345	11348	11273	11273	she	503	“ Yes . ”
11365	11370	11273	11273	she	503	“ And a cat . ”
11383	11405	11371	11371	Hunter	29	“ A cat is permissible . I did not state in the contract if she had to leave any pets behind . ”
11406	11410	11426	11426	Eldon	61	“ I see . ”
11411	11425	11371	11371	Hunter	29	“ And have you set up the letters for Ms. Petty ’s project ? ”
11432	11454	11426	11426	Eldon	61	“ They have been placed in an authentic Buchanan trunk dating from the Victorian era and left in the Blue Library . ”
11455	11491	11426	11426	Eldon	61	“ And you reviewed them to verify their accuracy ? This has to seem like a legitimate project , Eldon . I do n’t want her leaving early because she realizes it ’s a scam . ”
11492	11538	11426	11426	Eldon	61	“ I have been assured of the age and accuracy of the letters by the gentleman who sold them to me . He insisted that they have been in his family for generations and was only willing to part with them for a large sum . ”
11539	11573	11426	11426	Eldon	61	“ I do n’t care about how much they cost . I just want it to be enough to keep her here for a few weeks so I can get to know her . ”
11574	11587	11588	11588	Eldon	61	“ You may trust that it is under control , Mr. Buchanan . ”
11601	11616	11588	11588	Eldon	61	“ This does , however , bring me to the question of the publisher . ”
11617	11621	11426	11426	Eldon	61	“ The publisher ? ”
11622	11662	11588	11588	Eldon	61	“ The one you formed to push Ms. Petty ’s project ? You hired Mr. Stewart from his publishing house and told him to acquire employees and projects as long as Ms. Petty ’s book was given premium attention . ”
11705	11713	11695	11695	he	61	“ Is there a problem with Stewart ? ”
11714	11735	11736	11736	Hunter	29	“ I believe he wanted to discuss Bellefleur Publishing with you and get your opinion on some of the acquisitions . ”
11756	11765	11745	11745	He	29	“ Have him talk with my accounting people . ”
11766	11782	11695	11695	he	61	“ They are not fans of this project , just so you know , sir . ”
11783	11791	11745	11745	He	29	“ Why does it matter to them ? ”
11802	11821	11792	11792	Eldon	61	“ I believe one does not go into publishing with the expectation of making large amounts of money . ”
11822	11845	11846	11846	Hunter	29	“ Then it ’s a good thing that I did n’t go into this expecting to make money , is n’t it ? ”
11850	11877	11846	11846	Hunter	29	“ Tell him to contact my accountants . And tell my accountants to give the man whatever he needs to run his business — within reason . ”
11952	11964	11947	11947	she	383	“ You met Gretchen , Eldon . Tell me your thoughts . ”
11965	11976	11977	11977	He	29	“ It is not for me to say , sir . ”
11995	12003	11992	11992	he	29	“ She seemed . . . strong . ”
12095	12108	12090	12090	Eldon	61	“ Will our house guests affect the cleaning schedule , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
12109	12116	12090	12090	Eldon	61	“ No , they will not . ”
12117	12130	12090	12090	Eldon	61	“ Then I shall be off to resume my duties , sir . ”
12131	12137	12090	12090	Eldon	61	“ Thank you , Eldon . ”
12906	12910	12911	12911	Gretchen	503	“ Hi there , ”
12986	12992	12962	12962	Gretchen	503	“ You guys work here ? ”
13046	13055	13056	13056	she	422	“ I ’m staying in the east wing , ”
13060	13069	13056	13056	she	422	“ Working . Nice to see you all . ”
13070	13081	13082	13083	one woman	422	“ No one ’s supposed to be in this wing , ”
13089	13094	13082	13083	one woman	422	“ Today ’s Saturday . ”
13095	13100	13101	13101	She	422	“ Umm , okay . ”
13116	13129	13101	13101	She	422	“ Why ca n’t we be in the west wing today again ? ”
13130	13136	13137	13138	another woman	422	“ Because it ’s Saturday , ”
13141	13150	13137	13138	another woman	422	“ Off limits except to the cleaning crew . ”
13151	13159	13101	13101	She	422	“ Yeah , okay , but why ? ”
13164	13183	13160	13161	The woman	422	“ That ’s how it is . We do n’t make the rules . We just work here . ”
13207	13232	13199	13199	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m . . . um . . . just going to leave , I think . Have you guys seen Mr. Buchanan ? ”
13233	13243	13244	13246	the eldest maid	430	“ No one sees Mr. Buchanan except Mr. Eldon , ”
13250	13260	13244	13246	the eldest maid	430	“ Do you want me to call Mr. Eldon ? ”
13261	13277	13278	13278	Gretchen	503	“ No , that ’s okay . I already had my fill of Mr. Eldon . ”
13309	13320	13278	13278	Gretchen	503	“ So tomorrow ’s Sunday . What happens on Sunday ? ”
13321	13326	13329	13330	the women	170	“ Boathouse and Greenhouse , ”
13333	13342	13329	13330	the women	170	“ And any outlying buildings or special projects . ”
13343	13347	13278	13278	Gretchen	503	“ And Monday ? ”
13348	13382	13329	13330	the women	170	“ No one works on Monday or Tuesday . Wednesday is the north wing , Thursday is the east wing , Friday is the south wing , and Sunday is the west wing . ”
13383	13408	13278	13278	Gretchen	503	“ You do a different area each day of the week ? Huh . Which day of the week is Mr. Buchanan ’s room ? ”
13409	13412	13329	13330	the women	170	“ Wednesday . ”
13428	13436	13414	13414	he	433	“ And the rest of the family ? ”
13437	13450	13278	13278	Gretchen	503	“ No one else lives here except Mr. Eldon and Mr. Buchanan . ”
13480	13506	13597	13597	Spiffy	65	“ I see . Well , I think I ’m going to finish taking a look around , if that ’s okay with you guys . ”
13507	13521	13522	13523	One woman	422	“ Are you sure you do n’t want me to ring Mr. Eldon ? ”
13537	13544	13522	13523	One woman	422	“ I ’m sure he ’d — ”
13545	13569	13522	13523	One woman	422	“ No , I ’m good . I was just heading down to the kitchens . Can you tell me where they are ? ”
13570	13576	13577	13578	one maid	439	“ There ’s three kitchens , ”
13581	13596	13577	13578	one maid	439	“ But the only one that ’s kept stocked is in the north wing . ”
13599	13609	13577	13578	one maid	439	“ Thank you . Is there a kitchen staff ? ”
13610	13631	13522	13523	One woman	422	“ Just Mr. Eldon . He prepares all of Mr. Buchanan ’s meals . He ’s probably there right now . ”
13632	13636	13637	13637	Jeez	54	“ I see . ”
13661	13694	13647	13647	Gretchen	503	“ Well , skip that , then . I ’m not that hungry after all . I ’ll check the kitchens out some other time . Thanks for your help , ladies . ”
14458	14466	14467	14467	he	1396	“ Get the fuck out of here , ”
14485	14488	14489	14489	Gretchen	503	“ Sorry , ”
14505	14516	14489	14489	Gretchen	503	“ I did n’t mean to spy . I just — ”
14517	14533	14489	14489	Gretchen	503	“ Get out of here ! Go ! You ’re not allowed down this hall ! ”
14534	14542	14489	14489	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m so sorry ! I — ”
14543	14546	14489	14489	Gretchen	503	“ GO ! ”
15459	15464	15465	15465	she	26	“ Do n’t move , ”
15469	15475	15465	15465	she	26	“ I ’ll get it . ”
15510	15514	15500	15504	the sinister figure of Eldon	468	“ Ms. Petty . ”
15515	15519	15520	15520	Audrey	26	“ Good afternoon , ”
15524	15532	15520	15520	Audrey	26	“ Can I help you with something ? ”
15620	15645	15646	15646	Eldon	61	“ I ’m here to show the other Ms. Petty the project she will be working on , if now is a good time . ”
15692	15699	15700	15700	Eldon	61	“ Is now a good time ? ”
15709	15714	15700	15700	Eldon	61	“ A good time ? ”
15737	15754	15726	15726	Gretchen	503	“ Now is perfect . Audrey , can you keep an eye on Igor for me ? ”
15755	15761	15762	15762	Audrey	26	“ He ’s a cat , ”
15781	15790	15762	15762	Audrey	26	“ Exactly how much watching does he need ? ”
15791	15804	15805	15805	Gretchen	503	“ Just make sure he does n’t eat a tassel or something , ”
15848	15855	15856	15856	Gretchen	503	“ Lead on , my friend , ”
15860	15870	15856	15856	Gretchen	503	“ I ca n’t wait to see this project . ”
15897	15914	15885	15885	Gretchen	503	“ Mr. Buchanan wanted me to set proper expectations for you in regards to this project . ”
15915	15927	15928	15928	She	503	“ Proper expectations ? I think I hear a lecture incoming . ”
15950	15959	15960	15960	Eldon	61	“ This will be a quite lengthy project , ”
15967	15984	15960	15960	Eldon	61	“ It should take you at least a month to catalog and go through the letters . ”
15985	15992	15960	15960	Eldon	61	“ I ’m fine with that . ”
15993	16006	15960	15960	Eldon	61	“ The letters are very old and should be handled with care . ”
16007	16015	15960	15960	Eldon	61	“ Duh . I ’ll be careful . ”
16023	16064	16016	16016	He	61	“ Further , they are not to be removed from the premises . They are also not to be photocopied or scanned in . Mr. Buchanan is very concerned about the privacy of the project and the family ’s wishes . ”
16065	16070	16071	16071	Gretchen	503	“ Whatever you say , ”
16075	16097	16071	16071	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m just the hired help . You just point me at the letters and I ’ll get to work . ”
16098	16101	16016	16016	He	61	“ Indeed . ”
16124	16140	16114	16114	Gretchen	503	“ So the letters are from the Buchanan family ’s archives ? Is that correct ? ”
16141	16151	16152	16152	Eldon	61	“ I am not at liberty to discuss things , ”
16163	16176	16114	16114	Gretchen	503	“ Well , can I ask Mr. Buchanan about them ? I — ”
16177	16199	16261	16261	Whoa	69	“ Mr. Buchanan is busy . He is not going to be involved . Do not disturb him with your questions . ”
16200	16213	16114	16114	Gretchen	503	“ And that ’s fine , but I just thought that since — ”
16214	16223	16224	16224	He	61	“ You are not to bother Mr. Buchanan ! ”
16232	16260	16224	16224	He	61	“ He is a very busy man and does not want to be disturbed . Your being on location does not mean he is at your disposal . ”
16286	16300	16277	16277	Gretchen	503	“ I was n’t suggesting that . I was just going to say — ”
16301	16330	16261	16261	Whoa	69	“ If you are not interested in reviewing the project , Ms. Petty , I can let the publisher know that we are in need of another writer . ”
16331	16341	16342	16342	Gretchen	503	“ If you ’d let me finish a sentence , ”
16345	16367	16342	16342	Gretchen	503	“ you would know that that is not what I ’m saying at all . Just show me the damn letters . ”
16384	16391	16392	16392	Eldon	61	“ They are right this way , ”
16427	16432	16421	16421	he	58	“ Please follow me . ”
16651	16691	16644	16645	The butler	367	“ I do n’t think I need to remind you to keep these doors shut at all times . The library has many old and priceless books , and the hall here is quite sunny and could age them . ”
16692	16696	16697	16697	she	503	“ Of course , ”
16956	16966	16949	16949	she	503	“ So this is where I ’ll be working ? ”
16967	16970	16971	16971	Eldon	61	“ Indeed . ”
16974	16991	16971	16971	Eldon	61	“ I should like to remind you that nothing is to be removed from the library — ”
16992	16996	16949	16949	she	503	“ Of course . ”
16997	17022	16971	16971	Eldon	61	“ And please do not touch anything you do not feel you need for your project . Some of these items are quite valuable — ”
17023	17027	16949	16949	she	503	“ Of course . ”
17028	17036	16971	16971	Eldon	61	“ And then I must remind you — ”
17037	17058	17059	17059	He	61	“ Not to open the doors and let the sunlight in because the books will turn to dust . Right . ”
17076	17090	17069	17069	She	503	“ Do you want to warn me not to feed Mogwai after midnight ? ”
17096	17103	17104	17104	Gretchen	503	“ Never mind . Eighties joke . ”
17178	17185	17173	17173	Gretchen	503	“ So where are the letters ? ”
17186	17191	17192	17192	Eldon	61	“ Right this way . ”
17261	17272	17244	17244	Eldon	61	“ This desk has been designated for your work area . ”
17273	17276	17277	17277	She	503	“ Mmmhmm . ”
17303	17311	17244	17244	Eldon	61	“ The letters are in this trunk . ”
17327	17339	17312	17312	Gretchen	503	“ The container that holds the letters is in the trunk ? ”
17340	17343	17344	17344	Eldon	61	“ No , ”
17347	17355	17356	17356	He	61	“ The letters are in the trunk . ”
17461	17465	17445	17445	Her	503	“ All these ? ”
17466	17470	17471	17471	Eldon	61	“ All these , ”
17474	17481	17471	17471	Eldon	61	“ They are cataloged by year . ”
17482	17487	17488	17488	she	503	“ I see that , ”
17544	17555	17531	17531	They	486	“ Are there really thirty years of letters in here ? ”
17556	17561	17531	17531	They	486	“ So it seems . ”
17616	17622	17649	17649	Audrey	26	“ When can I start ? ”
17623	17629	17649	17649	Audrey	26	“ You can start tomorrow . ”
17633	17648	17649	17649	Audrey	26	“ You ’re fine with me going back to work and leaving you here ? ”
17727	17774	17775	17775	she	503	“ I ’m fine . I start the letters today , and if this weekend is any indication , Eldon ’s the only one I ’ll ever see . Mr. Buchanan is either avoiding us or not in residence , and either way suits me fine , ”
17923	17934	17935	17935	Audrey	26	“ I ’ve met Buchanan a few times , Gretchen . ”
17953	17981	17935	17935	Audrey	26	“ He ’s not what I ’d call friendly or pleasant . I just worry about you being here with only that man and that horrible butler . ”
17982	18020	17935	17935	Audrey	26	“ I ’ll be fine , Audrey . Me and Igor will just work on the book , live off sandwiches , and get this project done as soon as possible . It ’s no big deal . ”
18034	18064	18021	18021	Audrey	26	“ You ’re sure ? It ’s not that far of a drive from the Hawkings building . I can get into a cab and come get you if — ”
18065	18095	18096	18096	Gretchen	503	“ If what ? I fall down the stairs and no one notices my crumpled form for weeks ? Come on , Audrey . You ’ve seen this place . ”
18108	18157	18096	18096	Gretchen	503	“ This house could fit all of my apartment building in here with room to spare , and there ’s only two guys living here . The odds of me running into him are slim to none . If I need anything , I just ring for Eldon . ”
18158	18169	18170	18170	She	503	“ I know . I still do n’t like this . ”
18190	18197	18170	18170	She	503	“ It ’s a weird setup . ”
18198	18230	18096	18096	Gretchen	503	“ Yeah , but if Buchanan was a creepster , there are lots of cheaper ways to get women . Hookers do n’t cost nearly what the publisher ’s paying me . ”
18231	18238	18170	18170	She	503	“ That is so not funny . ”
18239	18281	18096	18096	Gretchen	503	“ Oh , I do n’t know . It ’s kind of funny if you think about it . I ’m the literary equivalent of a hooker . Give me a contract and I ’ll do whatever you want , baby . ”
18282	18287	18170	18170	She	503	“ Still not funny . ”
18288	18298	18096	18096	Gretchen	503	“ Come on . Just a little bit funny . ”
18299	18302	18170	18170	She	503	“ Nope . ”
18349	18358	18331	18331	His	1396	“ Tell Audrey it ’s funny , Igor . ”
18359	18381	18339	18339	she	503	“ Gretch , you ’ve really got to get out of the house more if you ’re talking to that cat . ”
18395	18410	18382	18382	She	503	“ Tell Audrey that Mommy ’s out of the house right now , Igor . ”
18411	18418	18419	18419	Audrey	26	“ This is what I mean . ”
18422	18433	18419	18419	Audrey	26	“ That cat gets more attention than your last boyfriend . ”
18434	18447	18448	18448	Gretchen	503	“ This cat is better to cuddle with than my last boyfriend , ”
18452	18463	18448	18448	Gretchen	503	“ And you ’re going to be late to work . ”
18486	18494	18464	18464	Audrey	26	“ You ’re going to be fine ? ”
18495	18504	18505	18505	She	26	“ Igor and I will be just fine . ”
18523	18545	18505	18505	She	26	“ Call me if you need me . And keep your phone on you so I can check you via text . ”
18546	18560	18464	18464	Audrey	26	“ I ’m twenty - six , Audrey . I can handle myself . ”
18561	18598	18505	18505	She	26	“ You ’re in your pajamas , talking to your cat . Forgive me if I feel a moment of doubt . It ’s like you ’re turning into the crazy cat lady before my eyes . ”
18599	18615	18616	18616	Gretchen	503	“ Am not . Igor and I are having a month - long slumber party , ”
18643	18653	18640	18640	Audrey	26	“ Is n’t that right , Igor - Wigor ? ”
18654	18662	18663	18663	She	503	“ God , you and that cat . ”
18668	18684	18663	18663	She	503	“ It ’s no wonder you ’re eternally single . I ’m out of here . ”
18685	18690	18691	18691	Gretchen	503	“ Text ya later , ”
18736	18752	18725	18725	her	503	“ I ’m thinking she ’s not fond of you as a roomie , Igor . ”
18773	18827	18764	18764	Gretchen	503	“ Okay , so Audrey might be right about the whole me - still - in - pajamas - talking - to - a - cat - is - pathetic thing . And given that I ’m still talking to you , she might also have a point about the eternally single thing . ”
19953	19957	19958	19958	She	503	“ Hi there . ”
19968	19979	19958	19958	She	503	“ I thought I ’d come out and say hi . ”
20011	20016	20017	20017	he	58	“ Are you drunk ? ”
20021	20024	20025	20025	she	503	“ No , ”
20052	20067	20068	20068	His	58	“ I ’m friendly . I saw you out here and wanted to talk . ”
20096	20105	20092	20092	He	58	“ I have nothing to say to you . ”
20137	20141	20142	20142	she	503	“ Your penis ! ”
20146	20151	20142	20142	she	503	“ I saw it ! ”
20179	20184	20185	20185	she	503	“ It ’s true , ”
20193	20224	20185	20185	she	503	“ I was snooping and I saw you naked . All of you . Really naked . That ’s why you wo n’t talk to me , is n’t it ? ”
20235	20273	20232	20232	she	503	“ I mean , you can sit here and pretend you do n’t want to talk to me , but we both know it ’s totally awkward because I saw your dick before I saw your face . ”
20304	20330	20296	20296	He	58	“I , uh , did n’t mean it like that . Damn , I ’m much better at banter when it ’s on the page . ”
20343	20350	20351	20351	She	503	“ Can we try this again ? ”
20364	20403	20351	20351	She	503	“ Hi there ! I ’m Gretchen , and I ’m working on ghostwriting the project in your library . I ’m only going to be here for a month , but I hope we can be friends . ”
20430	20447	20448	20448	Ouch	77	“ I trust you ’ll stay out of my way for the next month , then . ”
20461	20467	20450	20450	She	503	“ I guess I will . ”
20474	20487	20468	20468	He	58	“ See that you do . I ’m a very busy man . ”
20535	20543	20527	20527	you	531	“ Your penis , I saw it ! ”
20554	20564	20565	20565	she	503	“ Seems to work for Astronaut Bill and Uranea , ”
21901	21909	21910	21910	Gretchen	503	“ Were we supposed to dress up ? ”
21922	21950	21910	21910	Gretchen	503	“ I admit that I thought of this as a work trip so I wore my usual writing clothes . Sorry if I ’m a bit underdressed . ”
21951	21956	21957	21957	he	58	“ It ’s fine , ”
21961	21966	21957	21957	he	58	“ You are sufficient . ”
21976	21989	21967	21967	She	503	“ Sufficient ? I bet you say that to all the girls . ”
22047	22054	22036	22036	He	58	“ Thank you for the rose , ”
22360	22364	22365	22365	he	58	“ Blue Girl , ”
22383	22386	22387	22387	She	503	“ What ? ”
22421	22434	22394	22394	He	58	“ The rose I sent you . It ’s called Blue Girl . ”
22472	22493	22435	22435	Gretchen	503	“ I see . It ’s a lovely rose . I thought it was more purple than blue , though . ”
22494	22516	22517	22517	His	58	“ It is . Very hard to get a true blue color from roses . Most soil is not acidic enough . ”
22530	22533	22534	22534	She	503	“ Ah . ”
22821	22825	22826	22826	he	58	“ My apologies , ”
22829	22833	22834	22834	she	503	“ No problem , ”
22852	22874	22846	22846	he	58	“ Sorry I did n’t dress up . I figured this was n’t a date , so you know . . . ”
22899	22904	22905	22905	he	58	“ Of course not , ”
22933	22949	22916	22916	he	58	“ I simply wore a jacket because it was pleasing to me to dress well . ”
23003	23009	22992	22993	Mr. Buchanan	58	“ Would you like some ? ”
23010	23021	23022	23022	she	503	“ Are you just trying to get me liquored up ? ”
23028	23034	23035	23035	she	503	“ That was a joke , ”
23056	23063	23054	23054	he	58	“ I ’d love a drink . ”
23215	23220	23221	23221	she	503	“ I ’m Gretchen , ”
23228	23241	23221	23221	she	503	“ I do n’t know that we ever had a formal introduction . ”
23242	23247	23248	23248	he	58	“ We did not , ”
23255	23270	23248	23248	he	58	“ I find it hard to introduce myself when I am naked and unawares . ”
23321	23347	23348	23348	Gretchen	503	“ Yes , I do imagine it ’s quite hard when a madwoman approaches you in the gardens shouting about how she saw your penis , ”
23352	23365	23348	23348	Gretchen	503	“ I can understand how that ’s not much of an icebreaker . ”
23422	23429	23409	23409	he	58	“ I ’m Hunter . Buchanan . ”
23430	23437	23438	23438	she	503	“ I figured it was Buchanan , ”
23441	23460	23438	23438	she	503	“ Unless you were related to Eldon and you had the real Buchanan locked away in the attic . ”
23474	23482	23461	23461	He	58	“ Eldon is my assistant and butler . ”
23483	23493	23494	23494	Gretchen	503	“ Clearly you hired him for his sparkling personality , ”
23520	23555	23516	23516	Faux	81	“ Sorry . I ’m not trying to be unpleasant . He just was n’t very . . . welcoming when I arrived . I ’m sure he ’s quite capable as an assistant . ”
23591	23607	23556	23556	He	58	“ Eldon is very protective of the estate . He is not fond of visitors . ”
23608	23613	23614	23614	she	503	“ I gathered that , ”
23625	23638	23618	23618	He	58	“ Was he cruel to you ? Should I speak to him ? ”
23639	23644	23645	23645	Gretchen	503	“ Oh , no . ”
23659	23681	23645	23645	Gretchen	503	“ I was just surprised , that ’s all . So it ’s just you and him in this big house ? ”
23682	23687	23688	23688	Hunter	29	“ Not at all , ”
23711	23714	23645	23645	Gretchen	503	“ Oh ? ”
23715	23732	23688	23688	Hunter	29	“ The cleaning crew is here most days . I assume Eldon told you the schedule ? ”
23783	23788	23789	23789	she	503	“ This looks delicious , ”
23810	23817	23818	23818	Hunter	29	“ Eldon is an adequate cook , ”
23821	23838	23818	23818	Hunter	29	“ Well if that is n’t a ringing endorsement , I do n’t know what is . ”
23939	23945	23933	23933	He	29	“ Is everything all right ? ”
23964	23970	23955	23955	Gretchen	503	“ Great , thank you . ”
24135	24141	24124	24124	He	29	“ Something is bothering you . ”
24142	24151	24113	24113	Ouch	77	“ No , really , I ’m fine . ”
24164	24186	24152	24152	His	29	“ It ’s not necessary for you to humor me with dinner . If you wish to go , please go . ”
24252	24266	24244	24244	she	503	“ Sorry about that . I do n’t think I can eat this . ”
24276	24283	24267	24267	He	29	“ Do you not like Italian ? ”
24284	24292	24293	24293	she	503	“ Do n’t you have a cook ? ”
24297	24313	24293	24293	she	503	“ I mean , you ’re rich . You can afford a cook , right ? ”
24328	24335	24314	24314	He	29	“ Eldon ’s cooking is sufficient . ”
24336	24343	24344	24344	she	503	“ I ca n’t eat it , ”
24348	24375	24344	24344	she	503	“ It ’s not you . Trust me . I just . . . I ’ll gag if I have to pretend to like another mouthful . ”
24376	24381	24382	24382	he	29	“ You already gagged , ”
24402	24420	24386	24386	She	503	“ Yeah , I did . Thank God this dinner party is only for two , right ? ”
24421	24427	24386	24386	She	503	“ Is the wine acceptable ? ”
24449	24463	24428	24428	She	503	“ It ’s very quiet here , too . I find that unnerving . ”
24464	24467	24468	24468	He	29	“ Quiet ? ”
24484	24492	24468	24468	He	29	“ Do you not like the quiet ? ”
24493	24499	24500	24500	she	503	“ I live in SoHo , ”
24514	24567	24500	24500	she	503	“ There are cars on the street at all hours , and noisy neighbors , and people going up and down the stairs of my walkup . It ’s never quiet . You never feel isolated and alone like you do here . I guess I ’m just not used to it . ”
24568	24572	24617	24617	she	503	“ I see . ”
24583	24603	24573	24573	She	503	“ Your house is gorgeous , though . Please do n’t take it as a slight against this place . ”
24604	24609	24610	24610	He	29	“ I do n’t . ”
24639	24652	24573	24573	She	503	“ Well , I appreciate you letting me stay here , regardless . ”
24653	24662	24573	24573	She	503	“ But you do not like it here . ”
24663	24678	24573	24573	She	503	“ How can anyone not like it here ? It ’s like a castle . ”
24679	24690	24573	24573	She	503	“ Castles are not pleasant for those in the dungeons . ”
24691	24719	24720	24720	She	503	“ Well , if my room is a dungeon , it ’s the most enjoyable dungeon I ’ve ever stayed in . Seriously , it ’s fine . ”
24728	24745	24720	24720	She	503	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m insulting the grandest house I ’ve ever stayed in . ”
24746	24754	24755	24755	he	572	“ Perhaps it is not the house , ”
24759	24766	24755	24755	he	572	“ But the lack of company ? ”
24773	24781	24767	24767	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s probably it , yes . ”
24782	24788	24804	24804	He	572	“ What about your cat ? ”
24789	24800	24801	24801	she	503	“ Well , Igor ’s not much of a conversationalist , ”
24821	24831	24817	24817	he	572	“ I meant you could keep him with you . ”
24832	24859	24804	24804	He	572	“ Oh . That ’s very nice of you . I worry he might get lost , though . My room ’s larger than my apartment . ”
24860	24873	24874	24874	he	572	“ If he gets lost , I will help you find him , ”
24900	24906	24882	24888	the stuffy billionaire on hands and knees	573	“ You ’re very kind . ”
24907	24913	24914	24914	He	572	“ Would you . . . ”
24918	24930	24914	24914	He	572	“ Would you like to meet again for dinner tomorrow night ? ”
24969	24979	24959	24959	She	503	“ You do n’t sound excited by the prospect . ”
24980	24996	24951	24951	she	503	“ It is you who should not be excited . Eldon will be cooking again . ”
25000	25007	24997	24997	She	503	“ Can he make a sandwich ? ”
25023	25033	25017	25017	he	572	“ He can make a mean sandwich , yes . ”
25034	25040	24959	24959	She	503	“ Then dinner sounds terrific . ”
25062	25084	25047	25047	Gretchen	503	“ Seriously , Igor , I do n’t see how a project like this could be so mind - numbingly dull . ”
25590	25601	25602	25602	she	503	“ We ’ll just have to buckle down , Igor , ”
25619	25638	25602	25602	she	503	“ I ’ll come back after dinner and then we ’ll pick up round two . Sound good ? ”
25670	25680	25681	25681	she	503	“ I do n’t know how Hunter does it , ”
26218	26222	26223	26223	he	29	“ Good evening , ”
26233	26240	26241	26241	she	503	“ Hi to you , too , ”
26260	26266	26250	26250	him	29	“ Have a good day ? ”
26267	26271	26241	26241	she	503	“ It was — ”
26272	26275	26276	26276	she	503	“ Sufficient ? ”
26355	26358	26359	26359	he	29	“ Indeed , ”
26372	26379	26359	26359	he	29	“ How are the letters coming ? ”
26380	26385	26386	26386	she	503	“ They ’re coming , ”
26422	26433	26413	26414	the publisher	290	“ Nice weather we ’re having , is n’t it ? ”
26452	26493	26444	26444	he	290	“ Before I leave this place , Hunter Buchanan , I ’m going to get you to admit that you ’re having a good day and that the weather is nice . Not everything has to be shades of gray . ”
26507	26516	26494	26494	He	290	“ I see you received your rose today . ”
26517	26527	26528	26528	She	503	“ I did . What ’s this one called ? ”
26539	26543	26494	26494	He	290	“ Gypsy Carnival . ”
26544	26549	26494	26494	He	290	“ I love it . ”
26550	26554	26555	26555	He	290	“ Do you ? ”
26568	26592	26565	26565	Gretchen	503	“ Well , it ’s not quite my favorite so far . I liked the first one the best . The blue one . ”
26593	26600	26601	26601	He	290	“ Blue Girl . I remember . ”
26610	26628	26565	26565	Gretchen	503	“ I liked it best , though they ’re all incredibly lovely . Your taste is impeccable . ”
26776	26781	26765	26765	he	29	“ You hurt yourself . ”
26782	26787	26788	26788	She	503	“ It ’s nothing . ”
26837	26843	26844	26844	His	29	“ You should be careful . ”
26945	26953	26934	26934	His	29	“ May I ask you something personal ? ”
26954	26958	26959	26959	His	29	“ I suppose . ”
26967	26977	26934	26934	His	29	“ How did your . . . injuries happen ? ”
26993	27005	26934	26934	His	29	“ I ’m sorry I asked . I just . . . ”
27082	27100	27069	27069	he	29	“ You want to know about my scars ? Why I ’m as ugly as I am ? ”
27101	27107	27069	27069	he	29	“ I did n’t mean — ”
27108	27172	27173	27173	His	601	“ My secret is not a secret . Ask anyone and they ’ll tell you . You can find it in all the newspapers , too . When I was ten , I was kidnapped from boarding school and held for ransom . The fools thought that because my father was incredibly wealthy , that he ’d pay anything for his only heir . ”
27184	27268	27173	27173	His	601	“ They did not know my father well . My father did n’t give two shits about me . He did n’t care about leaving a legacy . He just wanted to see how much money he could acquire before he died . I was simply an inconvenience . When he ’d heard I ’d been kidnapped , the first thing he wanted to know was how much they wanted . And when he heard the price , he refused to pay it . ”
27275	27352	27353	27353	He	601	“ They kept me on a boat for a week . As the days passed , I knew my father was n’t sending anyone for me , so I planned my escape . I thought it ’d be easy to jump overboard and swim to shore . So I did , except when I went over the side , I hit the propeller . It destroyed my face and my arm and tore up my chest . ”
27359	27378	27353	27353	He	601	“ I almost lost all these fingers , but instead I only lost one . I nearly died . ”
27386	27412	27416	27416	his	601	“ I suppose I should be considered lucky . The propeller was moving at a very low speed and it only destroyed half of me . ”
27422	27462	27463	27463	Hunter	29	“ The kidnappers panicked as soon as they saw the blood in the water and tried to get away . A nearby fisherman saw me go overboard and swam out to save me . He is why I lived . ”
27467	27477	27463	27463	Hunter	29	“ Now you know . Never ask me again . ”
27974	27984	27963	27963	Hunter	29	“ Send the cleaning crew in this wing tomorrow . ”
27985	27989	27963	27963	Hunter	29	“ Of course . ”
27990	27996	27997	27997	Hunter	29	“ That ’ll be all . ”
28046	28056	28057	28057	Eldon	61	“ Shall I send her away , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
28179	28182	28183	28183	he	61	“ No , ”
28187	28191	28183	28183	he	61	“ She stays . ”
28192	28196	28183	28183	he	61	“ I see . ”
28197	28203	28204	28204	He	61	“ Thank you , Eldon . ”
28655	28665	28640	28640	Gretchen	503	“ Lulabelle , you little Victorian sexpot , you . ”
29356	29362	29363	29363	Eldon	61	“ You ’re here early , ”
29385	29412	29378	29378	She	503	“ Thought I ’d get a head start on things . Do n’t bother making me breakfast , by the way . I made my own . ”
29413	29421	29422	29422	he	61	“ I did not make you breakfast , ”
29437	29443	29444	29444	He	61	“ Yeah , I guessed . ”
29545	29548	29549	29549	Gretchen	503	“ Wait , ”
29581	29590	29557	29557	She	503	“ Can you please give this to Hunter ? ”
29638	29652	29653	29653	she	503	“ It ’s very important that he gets it as soon as possible , ”
29676	29718	29666	29666	Eldon	61	“ Dear Hunter , I would very much appreciate it if you would join me for dinner tonight in the kitchen . Nothing fancy , but I promise you I ’m a much better cook than Eldon . Sincerely , Gretchen . ”
29738	29748	29733	29733	he	367	“ I do n’t see anything urgent in this . ”
29749	29760	29761	29761	Gretchen	503	“ Yeah , well , it was n’t for you , ”
29771	29779	29761	29761	Gretchen	503	“ Just deliver it , all right ? ”
29780	29788	29733	29733	he	367	“ Shall I bring back a response ? ”
29789	29792	29793	29793	Gretchen	503	“ Nah , ”
29797	29809	29793	29793	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll know tonight if he shows up or not . ”
29810	29814	29815	29815	He	367	“ Very well . ”
30331	30338	30346	30346	His	61	“ She left you this note , ”
30398	30409	30366	30366	she	54	“ Thank you , Eldon . That ’ll be all . ”
30410	30414	30415	30415	Eldon	61	“ Very well , ”
30423	30445	30415	30415	Eldon	61	“ I shall return to my duties , unless you ’d like for me to carry your response back to her ? ”
30446	30459	30366	30366	she	54	“ No thank you . I ’m going to think on it . ”
30922	30925	30928	30928	Hunter	29	“ Enter , ”
30946	30949	30932	30932	She	503	“ Surprise . ”
30984	30991	30970	30970	he	29	“ What are you doing here ? ”
30992	31005	30932	30932	She	503	“ Nice to see you , too . Can I come in ? ”
31014	31018	31011	31011	his	29	“ Of course . ”
31063	31069	31054	31054	she	503	“ Gypsy Carnival , right ? ”
31070	31073	31054	31054	she	503	“ Correct . ”
31081	31099	31074	31074	She	503	“ I thought you were ordering flowers to send to me . You grow all of them ? ”
31117	31129	31130	31130	He	29	“ Gardening is my hobby . I enjoy roses the most . ”
31140	31152	31130	31130	He	29	“ This is where I come to get away from things . ”
31166	31171	31172	31172	she	503	“ It ’s marvelous , ”
31197	31219	31220	31220	She	503	“ You ’re really good at this — the roses look better than anything I ’ve ever gotten from a florist . ”
31238	31246	31220	31220	She	503	“ Do you do anything with them ? ”
31247	31250	31271	31271	He	29	“ Do ? ”
31251	31270	31220	31220	She	503	“ Yes . Do you sell them to a local florist or something ? You have so many . ”
31288	31325	31279	31279	his	29	“ I . . . sometimes I have Eldon show them . And sometimes I cross them , to try and see if I can create a new variety . But I mostly like growing them . ”
31336	31353	31326	31326	She	503	“ I would have never pictured a big , strong guy like you as a gardener . ”
31373	31378	31379	31379	he	29	“ I enjoy plants , ”
31383	31393	31379	31379	he	29	“ They are far easier to understand than people . ”
31394	31400	31401	31401	she	503	“ Most people are assholes , ”
31405	31418	31401	31401	she	503	“ I think that ’s why I prefer writing . Or baking . ”
31442	31457	31429	31429	she	503	“ Did you come out here to discuss the merits of books versus roses ? ”
31458	31463	31464	31464	She	503	“ Actually , no . ”
31472	31492	31464	31464	She	503	“ I wanted to come out here and ask you if you were going to come to dinner tonight . ”
31493	31498	31499	31499	His	29	“ I . . . ”
31509	31512	31499	31499	His	29	“ Perhaps . ”
31513	31519	31520	31520	she	503	“ Oh , come on , ”
31524	31540	31520	31520	she	503	“ I can tell you all about my day . It ’s been most interesting . ”
31601	31626	31585	31585	She	503	“ You know all those letters I ’ve been transcribing ? It seems that my two historical figures had a rather torrid love affair . ”
31671	31705	31659	31659	Gretchen	503	“ What ’s even better is that they describe , in rather blatant , sexual detail , what they want to do to each other . Is n’t that . . . interesting ? ”
31783	31789	31790	31790	she	503	“ What do you think ? ”
31793	31798	31790	31790	she	503	“ I . . . ”
31799	31802	31790	31790	she	503	“ Yes ? ”
31846	31855	31827	31827	he	29	“ I ’d like for you to leave . ”
31873	31882	31862	31862	She	503	“ So I take it dinner ’s off ? ”
31883	31896	31898	31898	he	29	“ I . . . no . I will think about it . ”
31906	31910	31911	31911	she	503	“ Suit yourself , ”
31915	31932	31933	31933	She	503	“ I ’m off to go read more letters . I hope to see you tonight . ”
32166	32174	32175	32175	Audrey	26	“ It sounds like he likes you , ”
32182	32191	32175	32175	Audrey	26	“ But it sounds like he ’s shy . ”
32192	32197	32198	32198	Gretchen	503	“ You think so ? ”
32226	32251	32221	32221	she	26	“ He ’s just so hard to predict . I ca n’t forget how he freaked out when I asked him about his face . ”
32252	32295	32175	32175	Audrey	26	“ Maybe he ’s just a loner . I mean , he ’s friends with Logan and his buddies , but out of all of them , he ’s the most remote . Does n’t attend any parties they give or anything . ”
32296	32303	32304	32304	Gretchen	503	“ He ’s definitely a loner , ”
32307	32337	32304	32304	Gretchen	503	“ But there ’s something so incredibly . . . remote about him . Most loners seem happy to be by themselves . He just seems a bit lost . ”
32338	32372	32373	32373	She	503	“ Yeah , Logan says that he ’s not the friendliest guy , but he ’s very true once he lets someone in . He ’s always very polite to me , though . ”
32387	32398	32399	32399	She	503	“ I did n’t think he ever left this house . ”
32428	32430	32431	32431	him	671	“ bother ”
32479	32499	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ Of course he leaves his house , Gretch . He has a billion - dollar real estate empire . ”
32500	32524	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ Yeah , but does he have to do anything for that other than just , I do n’t know , own property ? ”
32528	32541	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ You really have no idea how billionaires work , do you ? ”
32542	32563	32564	32564	She	26	“ I do n’t want to know , honestly . All that money just seems like a lot of hassle . ”
32591	32610	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ So did Logan tell you about his past ? The thing with the scars and the kidnapping ? ”
32611	32627	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ Nope . No one talks about it , apparently . No one except you . ”
32628	32637	32638	32638	She	26	“ Yeah , me and my big mouth . ”
32662	32676	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ I guess I should n’t have asked . But I was curious . ”
32677	32713	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ Well , leave your curiosity at the door . From what I can remember from meeting him , he does n’t like it if people so much as look at him the wrong way . ”
32714	32729	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ Jeez , Audrey , exactly how many times have you met this guy ? ”
32730	32749	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ A handful of times . Like I said , he ’s one of Logan ’s closest friends . ”
32750	32767	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ And you never thought to give your sister the cliff notes rundown on the man ? ”
32768	32786	32525	32525	Audrey	26	“ Well gee , Gretchen , I did n’t think you ’d want to bang the guy . ”
32791	32803	32787	32787	She	676	“ Is it weird that I ’m finding the scars sexy ? ”
32804	32807	32808	32808	Audrey	26	“ Yes , ”
32812	32825	32808	32808	Audrey	26	“ They ’re not cute scars , Gretch . They ’re disfiguring . ”
32826	32854	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ Yeah , but they have a story . He has a story . I like that about him . I just ca n’t figure him out . ”
32855	32866	32808	32808	Audrey	26	“ Have you considered that he might be a virgin ? ”
32867	32876	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ What ? He ’s not a virgin . ”
32877	32885	32886	32886	Audrey	26	“ Why does that seem so crazy ? ”
32889	32916	32886	32886	Audrey	26	“ You said he blushes , right ? And does n’t look you in the eye ? And that he was scarred at an early age ? ”
32917	32922	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ Yes , but — ”
32923	32941	32886	32886	Audrey	26	“ You think he ’s going to get a lot of ladies with a playbook like that ? ”
32942	32979	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ But he has to be close to thirty , if not already thirty . I ca n’t believe he ’d still be a virgin . Ca n’t you hire hookers for that sort of thing ? ”
32980	32990	32886	32886	Audrey	26	“ Gross , Gretchen . That ’s just gross . ”
32991	33002	32655	32655	Igor	1396	“ I know , but we were both thinking it . ”
33158	33168	33140	33140	he	29	“ You might be on to something , Audrey . ”
33169	33175	33176	33177	her sister	299	“ Of course I am , ”
33181	33195	33176	33177	her sister	299	“ The question is , what are you going to do about it ? ”
33196	33208	33140	33140	he	29	“ You mean , hold him down and take his virginity ? ”
33209	33225	33176	33177	her sister	299	“ No ! Yuck ! Gretchen , that ’s a visual I did not want . ”
33226	33246	33140	33140	he	29	“ You brought it up . What do you mean , what am I going to do about it ? ”
33247	33282	33176	33177	her sister	299	“ I mean that the man ’s skittish as hell . If he ’s a virgin , you ’re going to have a hell of a time getting him to come on to you . ”
33283	33292	33140	33140	he	29	“ So I ’ll come on to him . ”
33293	33346	33176	33177	her sister	299	“ But you said he retreats every time you try to get intimate . Perhaps he does n’t want you to come on to him . Maybe he wants to be the aggressor and you ’re not giving him a chance ? Is there a way you can level the playing field ? ”
33385	33391	33347	33347	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m not sure . ”
33392	33424	33425	33425	Audrey	26	“ He might be off balance and afraid to make a move if he thinks you ’re sexually experienced and he ’s not . Can you pretend to be a virgin ? ”
33432	33445	33347	33347	Gretchen	503	“ Har de har . I just need to think about it . ”
33446	33454	33347	33347	Gretchen	503	“ About pretending to be a virgin ? ”
33455	33464	33347	33347	Gretchen	503	“ No . About leveling the playing field . ”
33481	33489	33347	33347	Gretchen	503	“ Good luck , whatever you do . ”
33556	33561	33552	33552	she	503	“ level the playing field ”
33649	33654	33630	33630	Gretchen	503	“ Who is it ? ”
33655	33666	33635	33635	her	503	“ I . . . me . Hunter . Buchanan . ”
33695	33699	33685	33685	Gretchen	503	“ Hi there . ”
33770	33775	33759	33759	Gretchen	503	“ Is everything okay ? ”
33776	33781	33782	33782	Hunter	29	“ Everything ’s fine , ”
33799	33803	33785	33785	He	29	“ Leave us . ”
33833	33838	33839	33839	she	503	“ Who ’s that ? ”
33842	33846	33839	33839	she	503	“ My bodyguard . ”
33847	33858	33828	33828	she	503	“ I see . So you ’re ditching me tonight ? ”
33869	33883	33839	33839	she	503	“ That ’s not what I . . . that is , I — ”
33884	33918	33921	33921	she	503	“ I guessed it as soon as I saw the suit . Though I admit , you do clean up nice . I ’m a little sad the suit is n’t for me . ”
33960	33993	33945	33945	His	680	“ I came to give you my apologies . I ca n’t make it to dinner tonight . A business meeting was scheduled and I find that I can not move it . ”
33994	33998	33999	33999	Gretchen	503	“ No worries . ”
34009	34018	33999	33999	Gretchen	503	“ Thanks for letting me know , though . ”
34039	34057	34019	34019	He	680	“ I would , however , like if we were to meet for dinner tomorrow night instead . ”
34058	34063	33999	33999	Gretchen	503	“ Tomorrow ’s fine . ”
34064	34067	34068	34068	His	680	“ Good . ”
34073	34084	34068	34068	His	680	“ Very good . Good . That ’s . . . ”
34085	34088	34089	34089	she	503	“ Good ? ”
34158	34162	34145	34145	She	503	“ May I ? ”
34177	34182	34183	34183	she	503	“ It ’s crooked , ”
34254	34258	34238	34238	she	503	“ All better . ”
34293	34296	34269	34269	she	503	“ Hunter ? ”
34297	34300	34301	34301	He	29	“ Hmm ? ”
34338	34344	34345	34345	she	503	“ Now we ’re even , ”
34350	34361	34345	34345	she	503	“ The field is leveled . Enjoy your meeting tonight . ”
34913	34919	34900	34900	Gretchen	503	“ I should take this . ”
34947	34950	34959	34959	She	503	“ Hello ? ”
34951	34958	34959	34959	She	503	“ Gretch ? It ’s me . ”
34991	34999	34959	34959	She	503	“ Hey Coop . What ’s up ? ”
35000	35018	34959	34959	She	503	“ I was calling to , well , check on you . See how you ’re doing . ”
35019	35026	35027	35027	she	503	“ Oh , I ’m fine , ”
35031	35046	35027	35027	she	503	“ The project ’s coming along really well . I might even finish early . ”
35058	35064	35065	35065	Cooper	328	“ That ’s great news , ”
35069	35077	35065	35065	Cooper	328	“ I ’ve really missed seeing you . ”
35078	35087	35088	35088	She	503	“ I ’ve missed seeing you , too . ”
35104	35113	35114	35114	she	503	“ It ’s weird being away from everyone , ”
35128	35151	35114	35114	she	503	“ When you come back , I . . . I think I ’d like for us to have a nice talk . ”
35160	35186	35152	35152	Her	503	“ Oh , Coop . I just . . . I do n’t know . Ca n’t we just let things go as they do ? ”
35202	35218	35152	35152	Her	503	“ Can I call you back some other time ? Now ’s really not great . ”
35219	35246	35247	35247	His	29	“ Oh , of course . I just . . . you know . Wanted to tell you that I missed you . That ’s all . ”
35256	35266	35267	35267	she	503	“ I ’ll see you when I get back , ”
35287	35292	35279	35279	she	503	“ Sorry about that . ”
35293	35296	35297	35297	he	29	“ Boyfriend ? ”
35342	35351	35334	35334	She	503	“ A male friend . He misses me . ”
35352	35366	35367	35367	he	29	“ Then perhaps it ’s a good thing that you ’re finishing early , ”
35381	35393	35371	35371	He	29	“ I wo n’t keep you from your work any longer . ”
35394	35399	35414	35415	the man	1396	“ Oh , but — ”
35969	35972	35973	35973	she	503	“ No , ”
35976	35980	35973	35973	she	503	“ Do n’t . ”
36046	36052	36032	36032	Her	503	“ Is this for me ? ”
36064	36070	36071	36071	she	503	“ I think it is , ”
36075	36081	36082	36082	She	503	“ May I touch you ? ”
36219	36229	36230	36230	she	503	“ I want to get a look at you , ”
36238	36272	36230	36230	she	503	“ It makes me wet just thinking about this . I remember seeing you , naked and gleaming from the shower , though you were n’t as big then as you are today . ”
36313	36361	36362	36362	Her	503	“ You ’re very big . I like that . I imagine when I take you in my throat , it ’s going to be hard to take you deep , is n’t it ? I ’m going to have to work to fit all of you . ”
36382	36392	36362	36362	Her	503	“ You ’ll have to be patient with me . ”
36436	36451	36430	36430	Gretchen	503	“ Do you want me to stop ? Or can I keep exploring you ? ”
36452	36465	36466	36466	His	29	“ I . . . no . Keep . . . going . ”
36479	36482	36483	36483	she	503	“ Good , ”
36603	36620	36582	36582	Gretchen	503	“ I love touching you . Tastes so good . Do you want to touch me ? ”
36621	36626	36627	36627	His	29	“ I . . . ”
36632	36637	36638	36638	she	503	“ It ’s okay , ”
36646	36656	36638	36638	she	503	“ Maybe this time I ’ll just touch you . ”
36747	36766	36736	36736	She	503	“ I like it when you touch me . Show me what you want . Please , Hunter . ”
37037	37048	37025	37025	He	29	“ I . . . no . Gretchen . . . ”
37103	37106	37107	37107	His	29	“ Ah ! ”
37223	37229	37230	37230	he	29	“ I . . . , ”
37265	37277	37258	37258	She	503	“ Do n’t overthink it , Hunter . Just enjoy it . ”
37278	37281	37284	37284	he	29	“ Gretchen . ”
37324	37329	37300	37300	She	503	“ Goodnight , Hunter . ”
38425	38430	38431	38431	Gretchen	503	“ Oh ! Hey , ”
38446	38496	38431	38431	Gretchen	503	“ Sorry about this . I thought the roast would be ready in a half hour , but it ’s still looking a little pinker than I ’d like , so we need to give it a bit more time . That ’s why I ’m still in here . ”
38510	38527	38497	38497	She	503	“ Hope you do n’t mind filling up on bread and appetizers until it ’s done . ”
38546	38552	38528	38528	He	29	“ Is that for me ? ”
38553	38556	38557	38557	He	29	“ What ? ”
38576	38579	38580	38580	he	29	“ Yes , ”
38593	38602	38603	38603	she	503	“ The bud ’s tight on this one , ”
38645	38649	38618	38618	She	503	“ Smells wonderful . ”
38650	38653	38654	38654	he	29	“ Yes , ”
38691	38694	38677	38677	she	503	“ Soft . ”
38727	38732	38718	38718	She	503	“ Ready for dinner ? ”
38733	38738	38739	38739	He	29	“ I . . . ”
38771	38778	38761	38761	he	29	“ No . I must go . ”
39086	39090	39072	39072	his	29	“ I want this ”
39103	39114	39115	39115	she	503	“ Good God , these two are horny little buggers , ”
39296	39304	39289	39289	He	61	“ What may I help you with ? ”
39313	39322	39305	39305	Gretchen	503	“ Can you please give this to Hunter ? ”
39342	39349	39335	39335	he	61	“ More commentary about my cooking ? ”
39350	39363	39398	39398	Yick	95	“ Nope . I ’m inviting Hunter in for some research help . ”
39369	39397	39364	39364	Eldon	61	“ I am sure Mr. Buchanan would prefer not to be disturbed with such requests . If you need assistance , you are to go to me . ”
39427	39456	39417	39417	he	61	“ No , I ’m pretty sure he ’d prefer to help me with this on his own . Anyhow , can you just give him the note ? ”
39457	39461	39462	39462	Man	188	“ Very well . ”
39663	39669	39645	39645	He	29	“ Is there a problem ? ”
39670	39680	39645	39645	He	29	“ Yes . You wo n’t look at me . ”
39693	39696	39681	39681	He	29	“ I — ”
39697	39702	39703	39703	she	503	“ It ’s okay , ”
39722	39754	39703	39703	she	503	“ I was n’t trying to make you uncomfortable . I just know that you always look away when you ’re uneasy . You ’ve been avoiding me since the greenhouse . ”
39769	39800	39801	39801	She	503	“ Look , Hunter , I apologize if my actions made you uncomfortable . I want us to be friends . We can still be friends , ca n’t we ? ”
39813	39816	39817	39817	he	29	“ Friends , ”
39825	39829	39817	39817	he	29	“ Of course . ”
39830	39855	39876	39876	She	503	“ Great . I thought I ’d ask you , friend to friend , if you could help me with my project a little . ”
39871	39875	39856	39856	He	29	“ Of course . ”
39889	39917	39876	39876	She	503	“ Perfect . I ’m trying to transcribe this in a way that ’ll be interesting to readers , and I ’m having trouble with the dynamics . ”
39930	39933	39918	39918	Hunter	29	“ Dynamics ? ”
39959	39964	39934	39934	She	503	“ Shall we sit ? ”
40042	40079	40037	40037	she	503	“ I think if we ’re able to act out some of the things that are described , it ’ll be easier for me to write them . I ’m a visual learner , after all . ”
40080	40084	40085	40085	His	29	“ I see . ”
40165	40172	40173	40173	She	503	“ Shall we start , then ? ”
40245	40261	40232	40232	she	503	“ Why do n’t I read the first one ? You can read the next . ”
40262	40266	40267	40267	Hunter	29	“ Very well , ”
40301	40332	40283	40283	Gretchen	503	“ There is a man and a woman mentioned in this letter . I ’ll be Lula , and I ’d appreciate it if you can be Ben for me . ”
40339	40344	40345	40345	Gretchen	503	“ My dearest Ben , ”
40352	40402	40345	40345	Gretchen	503	“ It has been thirty days since we last saw each other . How languidly time passes when I am not in your arms . How achingly slow the sun moves through the skies , and the days cycle into evening . The nights are the hardest for me . ”
40422	40471	40419	40419	she	503	“ It seems the darkest hours are our time , my love . Last night I had a dream of our most recent party together . I remember that you found me in the dark . You put your hand on mine and guided it to your lips . ”
40537	40588	40525	40525	Gretchen	503	“ Then , it was like you changed your mind on what you wished to do to me . You took my hand and raised it over my head , pinning it there . I remembered that you held me down on the sofa and your weight settled over me . ”
40678	40690	40691	40691	he	29	“ Was this a plan to get me to touch you ? ”
40707	40712	40713	40713	She	503	“ Who , me ? ”
40720	40735	40713	40713	She	503	“ I just wanted you to help me act through some of the letters . ”
40736	40739	40740	40740	She	503	“ Mmmhmmm . ”
40768	40780	40766	40766	her	503	“ I might have had a slight ulterior motive . Slight . ”
40823	40828	40829	40829	he	29	“ What comes next ? ”
40833	40838	40839	40839	she	503	“ Let me see , ”
40853	40919	40839	40839	she	503	“ My pantaloons are damp with arousal just thinking of your touch . I think of your lips grazing over my skin . How you ’d rip my clothing away and bury your face into my feminine petals , determined to make me cry out with delight . You would taste me and please me even as your hands reached up to caress my breasts . ”
40928	40934	40920	40920	Gretchen	503	“ Whew . Sounds wild . ”
41093	41101	41084	41084	He	29	“ What did the letter say again ? ”
41102	41105	41106	41106	She	503	“ Um . ”
41178	41189	41169	41169	She	503	“ I think of your lips grazing over my skin . ”
41190	41195	41196	41196	He	29	“ Lips on skin ? ”
41272	41282	41267	41267	She	503	“ That feels so good , Hunter . More . ”
41301	41308	41283	41283	He	29	“ Does he lick her here ? ”
41309	41316	41317	41317	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m sure he does , ”
41364	41375	41354	41354	He	29	“ Tell me what to do — what pleases you . ”
41376	41382	41383	41383	she	503	“ Just keep doing that , ”
41427	41438	41409	41409	Her	503	“ God , Hunter , you feel incredible against me . ”
41439	41444	41445	41445	he	29	“ Rip your clothing , ”
41463	41472	41445	41445	he	29	“ Bury my face into your feminine petals . ”
41500	41507	41491	41491	She	503	“ Yes . Hunter , yes . ”
41596	41601	41602	41602	Hunter	29	“ Ah , fuck , ”
41629	41635	41614	41614	His	29	“ You taste so good . ”
41647	41654	41640	41640	his	29	“ Yes . Keep touching me . ”
41666	41671	41672	41672	he	29	“ Tell me how , ”
41681	41685	41686	41686	she	503	“ My clit , ”
41689	41695	41686	41686	she	503	“ Put your tongue there . ”
41728	41731	41713	41713	she	503	“ More . ”
41787	41796	41782	41782	she	503	“ Oooh , you ’re good at that . ”
41849	41854	41834	41834	Gretchen	503	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
41888	41896	41863	41863	His	29	“ I . . . ca n’t . ”
41897	41902	41903	41903	She	503	“ You ca n’t ? ”
41910	41922	41903	41903	She	503	“ Please , Hunter . You were so good at that . ”
41934	41950	41951	41951	He	29	“ It ’s not you . It ’s just . . . I . . . ”
41989	42003	41975	41975	She	503	“ You wo n’t touch me ? Do n’t you like touching me ? ”
42019	42024	42004	42004	Hunter	29	“ Love touching you . ”
42025	42034	42035	42035	she	503	“ Did you feel how wet I was ? ”
42039	42053	42035	42035	she	503	“ I need to come so badly . Wo n’t you touch me ? ”
42076	42098	42065	42065	Her	503	“ If you wo n’t finish me , I guess I ’ll have to do it myself , wo n’t I ? ”
42170	42176	42177	42177	she	503	“ Touch yourself for me , ”
42289	42300	42301	42301	She	503	“ Touch yourself , Hunter . I ’m so close . ”
42398	42403	42404	42404	Hunter	29	“ Do n’t stop , ”
42411	42420	42404	42404	Hunter	29	“ Need . . . to see it . ”
42421	42426	42427	42427	she	503	“ I wo n’t , ”
42456	42466	42467	42467	she	503	“ I wish it was your mouth on me , ”
42471	42478	42480	42480	she	503	“ Your cock deep inside me . ”
43273	43283	43265	43265	Her	503	“ Mmm , Hunter ? What ’s going on ? ”
43550	43553	43554	43554	he	29	“ Gretchen , ”
43586	43594	43579	43579	he	29	“ I — we need to talk . ”
43604	43611	43595	43595	Her	503	“ Talk ? That sounds bad . ”
43626	43637	43612	43612	She	503	“ Are you coming here to break up with me ? ”
43638	43641	43642	43642	He	29	“ No . ”
43674	43691	43670	43670	her	503	“ I just . . . there are things that need to be said between us . ”
43692	43715	43716	43716	She	503	“ That sounds very serious . Why do n’t you come to bed and tell me ? It ’s cold out here . ”
43902	43905	43906	43906	she	503	“ Better ? ”
43910	43915	43906	43906	she	503	“ You seem uneasy . ”
43941	43950	43951	43951	he	29	“ The lights off is better for you , ”
43955	43960	43951	43951	he	29	“ Less to see . ”
43999	44007	43985	43985	Gretchen	503	“ I like the way you look . ”
44008	44015	44016	44016	he	29	“ Do n’t lie to me , ”
44047	44055	44028	44028	He	29	“ I know what I look like . ”
44056	44062	44063	44063	she	503	“ I do , too , ”
44083	44133	44063	44063	she	503	“ You have dark hair and a strong nose , and scars on one side of your face . You ’re taller than me , have big arms , and you turn your cheek aside when possible , like you ’re trying to shield the world from your face . ”
44180	44198	44163	44163	he	29	“ People flinch when they look at me . They turn away when they see my face . ”
44199	44204	44205	44205	she	503	“ People are assholes , ”
44223	44239	44205	44205	she	503	“ You ’re a gorgeous , intelligent man . . . with a few scars . ”
44333	44340	44341	44341	she	503	“ Wo n’t you touch me ? ”
44347	44355	44341	44341	she	503	“ You seem so stiff and angry . ”
44398	44410	44388	44388	her	503	“ I do n’t know how to do this , Gretchen . ”
44411	44414	44421	44421	her	503	“ Hmm ? ”
44424	44433	44421	44421	her	503	“ Do n’t know how to touch me ? ”
44434	44437	44438	44438	he	29	“ No , ”
44452	44465	44438	44438	he	29	“ I ’ve never . . . I do n’t . . . ”
44466	44474	44421	44421	her	503	“ That ’s all right , Hunter . ”
44475	44480	44481	44481	he	29	“ It ’s not , ”
44544	44556	44533	44533	he	29	“ It ’s . . . not . . . okay . ”
44557	44587	44533	44533	he	29	“ I know you ’re a virgin , Hunter . I guessed as much . You were so young when you were hurt , I just assumed . . . ”
44607	44661	44600	44600	He	29	“ I just wanted you to know that it ’s not you . It ’s me . It ’s all me , and if I push you away it ’s because I do n’t know how to pull you close . I ’m not . . . I ’m not good with people . ”
44662	44669	44670	44670	she	503	“ I ’m not , either , ”
44677	44700	44670	44670	she	503	“ I do n’t know if you ’ve noticed , but I tend to blurt out the first thing I ’m thinking . ”
44701	44708	44709	44709	he	762	“ I like that about you , ”
44714	44721	44709	44709	he	762	“ I like everything about you . ”
44722	44725	44726	44726	She	503	“ Mmm . ”
44752	44798	44732	44732	he	762	“ I ca n’t stop thinking about you , Gretchen . I want to touch you all over . Explore you . Give you pleasure like I ’m supposed to , but every time you touch me , I just . . . lose it . ”
44799	44803	44804	44804	she	503	“ Hair trigger ? ”
44823	44835	44836	44836	she	503	“ Hunter . It ’s okay . I do n’t mind , ”
44840	44852	44836	44836	she	503	“ Is it me ? Am I too forward for you ? ”
44853	44867	44868	44868	He	762	“ No . I like you forward . It ’s just . . . ”
44906	44919	44920	44920	He	762	“ Do you want to explore me ? I do n’t mind . ”
44930	44933	44934	44934	she	503	“ Here , ”
44961	45005	44948	44948	She	503	“ I ’ll put my hands here and I wo n’t move them . You can touch me how you like , and I promise not to touch you back . We ’ll go as slow as you need to . I promise . ”
45060	45070	45051	45051	He	29	“ What should I — what do you want ? ”
45071	45083	45084	45084	Her	503	“ Whatever you like . I ’m here for the taking . ”
45106	45117	45084	45084	Her	503	“ This is your game . You ’re in charge . ”
45152	45164	45149	45149	her	503	“ You can go higher , you know . Nothing bites . ”
45165	45177	45140	45140	He	29	“ I know . I ’m just . . . enjoying . ”
45285	45292	45293	45293	she	503	“ Now we ’re getting somewhere , ”
45309	45317	45293	45293	she	503	“ Are you . . . nervous ? ”
45318	45324	45325	45325	she	503	“ I ’m mostly excited , ”
45339	45373	45325	45325	she	503	“ Full of anticipation . My belly — and other parts of me — are tingling with it . I ’ve been trying to get you to touch me for a week now . ”
45500	45531	45532	45532	He	29	“ If you want to take that shirt off me , you ’re going to have to do it on your own . I ca n’t help you , remember ? ”
45550	45559	45560	45560	he	29	“ I thought I was in charge here ? ”
45564	45582	45583	45583	she	503	“ You are . I ’m just bossy even if I ’m supposed to be all submissive , ”
45590	45604	45583	45583	she	503	“ You can always spank me for being bad , if you want . ”
45611	45622	45605	45605	He	29	“ Gretchen , please . I need to keep control . ”
45623	45633	45634	45634	She	503	“ Oh , of course . I ’m sorry . ”
45643	45674	45634	45634	She	503	“ I ’ll just lay here and be quiet . All silent and needy and half - naked , but very willing to be fully naked if given the opportunity . ”
45691	45700	45675	45675	His	29	“ What if I ripped this off you ? ”
45708	45721	45701	45701	Her	503	“ That would be extremely naughty of you . I ’m game . ”
45765	45774	45775	45775	He	29	“ You going to rip my panties next ? ”
45832	45837	45820	45820	Gretchen	503	“ Are they sexy ? ”
45838	45873	45820	45820	Gretchen	503	“ Mmm , not really . They ’re boy shorts with a bit of lace . I was n’t really coming here expecting to get laid , so I did n’t pack my best . ”
45874	45887	45820	45820	Gretchen	503	“ I . . . do n’t know what boy shorts are . ”
45888	45899	45820	45820	Gretchen	503	“ Then yes , they ’re incredibly , ultra sexy . ”
45900	45908	45909	45909	He	29	“ Then I should n’t rip them . ”
46155	46160	46161	46161	she	503	“ You ’re quiet , ”
46164	46168	46161	46161	she	503	“ Just thinking . ”
46169	46180	46133	46133	She	503	“ Uh - oh . Good thinking or bad thinking ? ”
46181	46189	46161	46161	she	503	“ Thinking about you . Good thinking . ”
46190	46197	46133	46133	She	503	“ Sexy thinking , I hope . ”
46198	46207	46161	46161	she	503	“ Thinking about where to touch you next . ”
46208	46211	46212	46212	she	503	“ Wellllll , ”
46215	46234	46212	46212	she	503	“ I ’m told my feet are quite ugly . I ’d advise against heading in that direction . ”
46235	46242	46243	46243	he	29	“ Nothing on you is ugly , ”
46256	46265	46266	46266	she	503	“ Perhaps you did not see my feet , ”
46327	46333	46319	46319	he	29	“ Feels lovely to me . ”
46340	46346	46334	46334	She	503	“ Your fingers are ticklish . ”
46347	46352	46334	46334	She	503	“ Should I stop ? ”
46353	46371	46334	46334	She	503	“ No . It ’s not a bad ticklish . Just . . . makes me shiver . ”
46419	46429	46408	46408	Her	503	“ Oh , okay . That feels pretty good . ”
46441	46449	46430	46430	His	29	“ You ’re very soft , Gretchen . ”
46450	46512	46408	46408	Her	503	“ Mmm , yeah . I ’m pretty soft all over , I hear . All those hours at the computer and stuff . It does n’t exactly lend itself to tons of muscles . Gardening seems to be working for you , though . That ’s one amazing six - pack I saw when you got out of the shower . ”
46548	46568	46545	46545	He	29	“ I do n’t just garden , you know . I have a gym and I work out daily . ”
46596	46607	46608	46608	Her	503	“ Holy crap , Hunter . Did you just laugh ? ”
46615	46636	46608	46608	Her	503	“ I ’m so bummed . I finally got you to laugh and I did n’t get to see it . ”
46676	46685	46670	46670	Her	503	“ Does this bother you ? My touch ? ”
46702	46706	46693	46693	He	29	“ Go ahead . ”
46778	46795	46796	46796	Her	503	“ I do n’t find you ugly , Hunter . No one who knew you could . ”
46802	46852	46796	46796	Her	503	“ If anything , I ’m grateful that you have these scars , because they saved you for me — for this moment in time . And that ’s a little selfish of me , is n’t it ? And yet I ca n’t help but feel that way . ”
47051	47055	47043	47043	She	503	“ Too much ? ”
47111	47122	47098	47098	He	29	“ Is n’t this supposed to be on the headboard ? ”
47123	47132	47133	47133	She	503	“ Oooh , right . I got distracted . ”
47136	47147	47133	47133	She	503	“ Guess you ’ll have to spank me , huh ? ”
47173	47188	47170	47170	she	503	“ Hands are now back in place . Do with me as you will . ”
47189	47198	47216	47216	she	503	“ I ’m not going to spank you . ”
47208	47214	47216	47216	she	503	“ You ’re no fun . ”
47256	47262	47250	47250	She	503	“ Mmmm . Keep going . ”
47459	47462	47448	47448	She	503	“ Hunter ? ”
47495	47507	47508	47508	Her	503	“ Hunter ? Where are you ? Please do n’t leave . ”
47513	47527	47528	47528	He	29	“ I . . . I ca n’t stay . I . . . ”
47547	47561	47562	47562	He	29	“ But your touch feels so good . And I ache so bad . ”
47568	47576	47562	47562	He	29	“ Wo n’t you come touch me ? ”
47577	47580	47581	47581	he	29	“ Gretchen , ”
47585	47595	47581	47581	he	29	“ I . . . need to clean up . ”
47610	47625	47626	47626	Astonishment	101	“ After you clean up , will you come back and finish touching me ? ”
47654	47663	47646	47646	she	503	“ You still want me to touch you ? ”
47664	47677	47626	47626	Astonishment	101	“ Hey , you got yours . I want to get mine . ”
47678	47696	47646	47646	she	503	“ But that ’s not how this works . I wanted to make it good for you . ”
47697	47709	47710	47710	she	503	“ And I intend on you making it good for me , ”
47713	47734	47710	47710	she	503	“ No sense in us stopping now if we ’re having fun . And I thought we were having fun . ”
47735	47745	47746	47746	he	29	“ Some of us were having too much fun , ”
47756	47780	47646	47646	she	503	“ Oh , my God , did you just make a joke ? I should leave you in the dark all the time . ”
47781	47785	47710	47710	she	503	“ Very funny . ”
47786	47814	47646	47646	she	503	“ I know . I ’m full of sparkling humor . Sparkling humor and soft , soft skin that you need to come over here and touch . ”
47822	47856	47815	47815	He	29	“ I think there ’s a stack of towels on the chair by the fireplace . Fix yourself up and come back to me . I ’m just going to wait right here . ”
47897	47903	47904	47904	she	503	“ Are you coming back ? ”
47984	47996	47981	47981	Hunter	29	“ Touch me , Hunter . Use your fingers on me . ”
48229	48234	48235	48235	She	503	“ Oh , God . ”
48240	48249	48250	48250	She	503	“ Right there . Oh , keep going . ”
48294	48299	48300	48300	she	503	“ More , Hunter , ”
48303	48308	48300	48300	she	503	“ I need more . ”
48337	48343	48344	48344	she	503	“ My clit , baby , ”
48348	48357	48344	48344	she	503	“ Get my clit for me , baby . ”
48646	48651	48652	48652	she	503	“ Mmmm , Hunter ? ”
48663	48672	48652	48652	she	503	“ You ’re not leaving , are you ? ”
48680	48692	48673	48673	He	29	“ I ’m not . . . I fucked this up . ”
48693	48699	48652	48652	she	503	“ Fucked it up how ? ”
48704	48739	48740	48740	She	503	“ Hunter , if it ’s because you ’re still a virgin , do n’t worry about it . We ’ll take our time . I ’m kind of enjoying endless amounts of foreplay . ”
48745	48759	48740	48740	She	503	“ You did n’t bring a condom with you tonight , did you ? ”
48760	48763	48764	48764	he	29	“ No , ”
48767	48811	48814	48814	her	503	“ Well , then , there ’s no sense in hating on yourself , is there ? No glove , no love . It ’s probably a good thing that we never got further than the heavy petting . Now , come on . ”
48819	48832	48814	48814	her	503	“ I kind of felt like cuddling , if you ’re game . ”
48915	48920	48921	48921	she	503	“ That was incredible , ”
48929	48933	48921	48921	she	503	“ Thank you . ”
48934	48941	48942	48942	he	29	“ I should be thanking you , ”
48946	48961	48962	48962	She	503	“ Mmm , I do n’t know . You have a very talented mouth . ”
48965	48976	48962	48962	She	503	“ Do n’t sneak away on me again , okay ? ”
49000	49005	48977	48977	He	29	“ I wo n’t . ”
49402	49407	49397	49397	He	29	“ What the fuck — ”
49450	49453	49458	49458	Gretchen	503	“ Mmm ? ”
49466	49473	49458	49458	Gretchen	503	“ I see you met Igor . ”
49480	49486	49474	49474	He	29	“ This is your cat ? ”
49487	49491	49474	49474	He	29	“ It is . ”
49492	49497	49474	49474	He	29	“ He ’s naked . ”
49513	49522	49502	49502	her	503	“ That makes three of us , then . ”
49536	49542	49523	49523	His	29	“ Gretchen , do n’t — ”
49543	49557	49558	49558	Her	503	“ Do n’t touch you ? Did someone wake up with morning wood ? ”
49590	49597	49571	49571	She	503	“ Mmm , you sure did . ”
49598	49604	49605	49605	God	50	“ Can you blame me ? ”
49652	49659	49660	49660	She	503	“ So it ’s my fault ? ”
49672	49687	49660	49660	She	503	“ Guess I should take care of it for you , should n’t I ? ”
49744	49762	49729	49729	He	29	“ Gretchen , I . . . oh , fuck . You ’re amazing . So amazing . ”
49763	49767	49768	49768	she	503	“ I know , ”
50026	50038	50011	50011	She	503	“ Just a little something to start the day off right . ”
50039	50053	50002	50002	He	29	“ The day started off right when I woke up and saw you . ”
50070	50090	50058	50058	she	503	“ Keep saying stuff like that and it ’s going to be very hard to get rid of me . ”
50604	50607	50597	50597	Gretchen	503	“ Hello ? ”
50608	50628	50592	50592	she	503	“ Gretchen , honey , tell me you ’re hitting send on that Astronaut Bill manuscript as we speak ? ”
50632	50653	50629	50629	She	503	“ Hey , Kat . And um , it ’s not done . I still need another week or two . ”
50654	50675	50597	50597	Gretchen	503	“ Gretch ! You told me you ’d have it done in a week . . . two weeks ago . ”
50676	50700	50709	50709	she	503	“ I know . This other project has been a little more . . . time consuming than I thought it would be . ”
50774	50807	50765	50765	her	503	“ Well , ca n’t you put the project aside for a few days and finish this other one ? Just have Bill shag Uranus in her anus and send it off . ”
50808	50823	50905	50905	Kat	53	“ Uranea and the publisher would freak out if I threw in butt sex . ”
50824	50904	50905	50905	Kat	53	“ Whatever , and the publisher ’s freaking out right now because you ’re grossly overdue . Gretchen , they ’re going to fire you if you do n’t get this book in . I ’m your agent . I ’m supposed to tell you when you ’re doing bad career moves , right ? This is a bad one . Very bad . Can you just sit down and hammer out a few chapters for me ? Please ? ”
50911	50935	50905	50905	Kat	53	“ So I do n’t have to make an ugly phone call about how my favorite client did n’t hit her deadline again ? ”
50944	50960	50936	50936	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m pulling up the document as we speak , Kat . I promise . ”
50961	50974	50905	50905	Kat	53	“ Good . Think you can send it to me by tomorrow ? ”
50975	50978	50936	50936	Gretchen	503	“ Ummm . ”
50979	50994	50905	50905	Kat	53	“ I ’ll take that as a yes . Do n’t tell me otherwise . ”
50995	50998	50936	50936	Gretchen	503	“ Okay . ”
50999	51016	51017	51017	Kat	53	“ Since I have you on the phone , I did have a chat with Preston . ”
51031	51050	51023	51023	Gretchen	503	“ Preston Stewart ’s the editor for the new publisher , right ? What was the name again ? ”
51051	51059	50936	50936	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s him . Bellefleur Publishing . ”
51060	51087	51023	51023	Gretchen	503	“ Uh - huh . Did they ask for me because the Astronaut Bill stuff is pulp and I ’m used to writing in some sex ? ”
51088	51100	50936	50936	Gretchen	503	“ Huh ? What does that have to do with anything ? ”
51101	51113	51023	51023	Gretchen	503	“ The letters . Does he know these are dirty letters ? ”
51117	51121	51114	51114	Kat	53	“ Say what ? ”
51122	51180	50936	50936	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m serious ! The trunk is full of letters between a gal named Lula and her boyfriend , Ben . It took years for them to be together , and so apparently they spent all that time in - between visits sending dirty recaps to each other . Want me to read you a page ? ”
51181	51189	51114	51114	Kat	53	“ Dirty letters ? Are you sure ? ”
51202	51235	51190	51190	Gretchen	503	“ My dearest Ben . I woke up this morning , my woman ’s flesh aching with need for you . I dreamed that you were deep inside me , your rod — ”
51236	51241	51242	51242	Kat	53	“ Okay , okay ! ”
51246	51269	51242	51242	Kat	53	“ Oh , man . Well , that ’s going to be a wicked cool marketing angle , that ’s for sure . ”
51270	51276	51277	51277	Gretchen	503	“ If you say so , ”
51282	51321	51277	51277	Gretchen	503	“ Apparently these two lovebirds went to a lot of Victorian house parties and used every excuse to sneak off and make out while there . They ’re kind of creative with things . It ’s rather inspiring . ”
51322	51355	51190	51190	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll say . Anyhow , back to Preston . He ’s super excited about your book , too . How ’s it feel to be a lead title , kiddo ? ”
51356	51368	51277	51277	Gretchen	503	“ I . . . have n’t given it much thought . ”
51369	51374	51375	51375	Kat	53	“ You have n’t ? ”
51378	51388	51375	51375	Kat	53	“ What ’s going on with you , Gretchen ? ”
51389	51403	51519	51519	Count	57	“ I ’ve been , um , distracted . I met a guy . ”
51404	51426	51375	51375	Kat	53	“ A guy ? Audrey told me all about that horrible butler . Do n’t tell me you fell for him ? ”
51427	51439	51519	51519	Count	57	“ Jeez , Kat , when did you talk to Audrey ? ”
51440	51470	51375	51375	Kat	53	“ We went for lunch the other day . I had some books for her to pick up for the charity and we ended up going out for drinkies . ”
51471	51482	51483	51483	Gretchen	503	“ I think I need to widen my social circle , ”
51486	51510	51483	51483	Gretchen	503	“ And no , I did n’t fall for the butler . But I just might be kinda - sorta shagging his boss . ”
51511	51518	51375	51375	Kat	53	“ You what ? The billionaire ? ”
51544	51555	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ He ’s different , Kat . I like him . ”
51556	51567	51519	51519	Count	57	“ Of course you like him . He ’s rich ! ”
51568	51581	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ Can we talk about something other than how much he makes ? ”
51582	51593	51519	51519	Count	57	“ Sure . What kind of car does he drive ? ”
51594	51612	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ Not funny . I like him because he ’s different , not because he ’s rich . ”
51613	51656	51519	51519	Count	57	“ I ’m just teasing you , Gretchen . It ’s good that you met someone . I just wish he was n’t directly tied to the job you ’re doing . As your agent , that makes me a little uncomfortable . ”
51657	51670	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ It ’s not like he ’s actually involved in the project , ”
51675	51689	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ He just happens to own the house the letters were found in . ”
51690	51709	51519	51519	Count	57	“ Very , very dirty letters . You sure you ’re not getting inspired by these dirty letters ? ”
51710	51717	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ Give me a little credit ? ”
51718	51731	51519	51519	Count	57	“ Just a little . I ’d like to meet this guy . ”
51732	51750	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ We ’re just fooling around , Kat . It ’s not like this is anything official . ”
51751	51772	51519	51519	Count	57	“ I do n’t care . I still want to meet him . Maybe he has a sexy younger brother . ”
51773	51804	51539	51539	Gretchen	503	“ He ’s an only child . But I ’ll see what I can do about getting some friends together . This house would be a great place to entertain . ”
51821	51853	51818	51818	Kat	53	“ Oooh , maybe we can do a Victorian house party ! We can invite your editor so he can get excited about the progress you ’re making on the book . ”
51854	51860	51519	51519	Count	57	“ I do n’t know — ”
51861	51887	51818	51818	Kat	53	“ And the publicist ! And a photographer . Think of the angle we can spin on things to get some in - house excitement . ”
51888	51921	51519	51519	Count	57	“ I do n’t know if the owner of the house is going to be particularly excited about this . He ’s pretty reclusive . And by pretty , I mean completely . ”
51922	51954	51818	51818	Kat	53	“ So , you can just take him into a closet and play Seven Minutes in Heaven or something . Victorian house party coming up ! So where ’s my invite ? ”
51958	51967	51955	51955	Gretchen	503	“ Let me work on him , Kat . ”
51968	51992	51519	51519	Count	57	“ Tell him it ’ll be good for your career . You need as much in - house support as you can get . ”
51993	51998	51955	51955	Gretchen	503	“ We ’ll see . ”
52046	52113	52114	52114	She	503	“ Oh , Astronaut Bill , what can we do ? The universe is doomed for sure . The solarship with the cargo full of super - plutonium is headed straight for the galaxy warp . If we ca n’t get on board somehow , it ’ll cut across space and head straight for the planet of my people , Vifraxa . Billions will be doomed . ”
52124	52134	52114	52114	She	503	“ You must find a way to save them . ”
52159	52169	52147	52147	He	42	“ We ’ll find a way to stop them . ”
52175	52187	52170	52170	He	42	“ I have it ! All we need to do is — ”
52756	52766	52753	52753	he	61	“ What are you doing in the north wing ? ”
52767	52799	52753	52753	he	61	“ Hello to you , too . I ’m looking for Hunter . He ’s not in his room and not in the greenhouse . Any idea where he would be ? ”
52800	52807	52753	52753	he	61	“ I ’m not his keeper . ”
52818	52835	52808	52808	She	503	“ I know you ’re not . Ca n’t you just tell me where he is ? ”
52836	52839	52753	52753	he	61	“ Why ? ”
52840	52849	52850	52850	She	503	“ I ’m going to go deflower him . ”
52861	52875	52850	52850	She	503	“ Hey , you asked . Now , seriously , where is he ? ”
52876	52884	52753	52753	he	61	“ You ’re a vile young woman . ”
52885	52898	52850	52850	She	503	“ Yeah , well , you ’re kind of a dick yourself . ”
52907	52967	52850	52850	She	503	“ Look , Eldon , I just want to spend some time with your boss . I do n’t think he ’d be keen on you keeping information from me . You may not like me , but he does . So spill the beans or I ’m going to tell him you ’re trying to keep us apart . ”
52987	52995	52984	52984	he	813	“ Did you look in his office ? ”
53014	53023	52999	52999	Eldon	61	“ No , where ’s his office at ? ”
53024	53036	53037	53037	He	813	“ Second floor , west wing . Third door on right . ”
53041	53046	53047	53047	she	813	“ Grumpy , grumpy , ”
53132	53135	53136	53136	Hunter	29	“ Enter , ”
53382	53385	53379	53379	his	29	“ Gretchen ? ”
53386	53392	53355	53355	He	29	“ Hey . You busy ? ”
53409	53427	53393	53393	He	29	“ Just have a few meetings today I ca n’t reschedule . What are you doing here ? ”
53460	53471	53449	53449	she	503	“ I thought I ’d come by and devirgin you . ”
53477	53480	53472	53472	His	29	“ What ? ”
53481	53491	53492	53492	She	503	“ Your virginity — I’ve come to take it . ”
53507	53517	53492	53492	She	503	“ Unless you ’re not interested , of course . ”
53518	53525	53526	53526	His	29	“ What happened to going slow ? ”
53574	53589	53550	53550	Gretchen	503	“ I promise to go slow , if that makes you feel any better ? ”
53590	53593	53537	53537	she	503	“ Gretchen — ”
53594	53654	53655	53655	She	503	“ The way I figure it is that we ’ve been going about this all wrong . I thought taking it nice and slow would make you feel more comfortable , but now I ’m thinking we should treat this like ripping off a Band - Aid — make it rough and fast so you wo n’t overthink things . ”
53685	53694	53671	53671	His	29	“ Parts of you are interested at least . ”
53695	53704	53705	53705	he	29	“ All of me is interested , Gretchen , ”
53712	53729	53705	53705	he	29	“ But I have a conference call in two minutes and I ca n’t reschedule it . ”
53730	53733	53734	53734	She	503	“ Mmm . ”
53742	53757	53734	53734	She	503	“ I can stick around , you know . I promise to be quiet . ”
53758	53767	53734	53734	She	503	“ I wo n’t be able to concentrate — ”
53823	53828	53805	53805	He	29	“ Hunter Buchanan here . ”
53937	53946	53926	53926	He	29	“ Do n’t move like that . Please . ”
53947	53953	53954	53954	she	503	“ I ’ll be good , ”
53979	53989	53968	53968	He	29	“ No , I ’m here . Go on . ”
54320	54325	54326	54326	she	503	“ Why the mirror ? ”
54345	54358	54329	54329	He	833	“ So I never forget who — and what — I am . ”
54359	54364	54365	54365	she	503	“ That ’s depressing , ”
54379	54389	54365	54365	she	503	“ You know who does that ? Emo people . ”
54390	54395	54396	54396	Hunter	29	“ Uh - huh , ”
54437	54446	54422	54422	He	29	“ How many inspectors did you send out ? ”
54544	54547	54528	54528	he	29	“ Mmmhmm . ”
54570	54574	54528	54528	he	29	“ Go on . ”
54656	54665	54638	54638	He	29	“ You ’re not playing fair , Gretchen . ”
54666	54674	54675	54675	she	503	“ You told me to go on , ”
54682	54686	54687	54687	His	29	“ Goddamn it . ”
54695	54711	54687	54687	His	29	“ I ’m going to have to fight fire with fire , are n’t I ? ”
54712	54718	54719	54719	she	503	“ I wish you would , ”
54775	54783	54784	54784	he	29	“ I ’m a very busy man , ”
54797	54805	54784	54784	he	29	“ I ca n’t afford these distractions . ”
54806	54811	54812	54812	she	503	“ Of course not , ”
54840	54846	54831	54831	He	29	“ You ’re soaked already . ”
54847	54855	54856	54856	she	503	“ Thinking about you gets me hot , ”
54867	54873	54856	54856	she	503	“ Ca n’t help myself . ”
54939	54958	54928	54928	He	29	“ I ’m going to have to drop off the call . Someone send me the meeting minutes . ”
54975	54984	54960	54960	he	29	“ You ’re derailing my plans , Gretchen . ”
55008	55026	54985	54985	She	503	“ You derailed mine . I kept thinking about you and could n’t get any work done . ”
55041	55052	55053	55053	His	29	“ Clearly you need a taste of your own medicine . ”
55079	55087	55088	55088	Her	503	“ Is this your idea of punishment ? ”
55095	55105	55106	55106	he	29	“ Actually , I just want to touch you , ”
55162	55170	55150	55150	his	29	“ Then touch me all you want . ”
55222	55242	55215	55215	her	503	“ Gretchen , I do n’t know how long I ’ll last with you on my lap like this . ”
55243	55254	55255	55255	she	503	“ Then maybe we should get that condom on you , ”
55259	55275	55255	55255	she	503	“ And then I can get back on your lap after you put it on . ”
55356	55369	55347	55347	He	29	“ I can do this . I want you to get naked . ”
55507	55512	55513	55513	he	29	“ Sit down again , ”
55586	55594	55595	55595	She	503	“ Take me inside you , Gretchen . ”
55684	55689	55690	55690	he	29	“ Ah , fuck , ”
55693	55698	55690	55690	he	29	“ You feel amazing . ”
55814	55828	55808	55808	he	29	“ Never thought I ’d feel anything so good , Gretchen . Never . ”
55842	55849	55850	55850	she	503	“ The fun ’s just starting , ”
55869	55872	55863	55863	His	29	“ Ah ! ”
55873	55889	55863	55863	His	29	“ Oh , Hunter . You ’re so deep inside me . That feels unbelievable . ”
55890	55893	55894	55894	he	29	“ Gretchen , ”
56002	56008	56009	56009	she	503	“ Touch me , Hunter , ”
56021	56031	56009	56009	she	503	“ I ’ve got you . Just touch me . ”
56118	56121	56122	56122	he	29	“ Damn , ”
56128	56149	56122	56122	he	29	“ I think I like you being on top , but I want to be in charge for a bit . ”
56150	56156	56157	56157	she	503	“ I ’m all yours , ”
56184	56188	56189	56189	he	29	“ Lean forward , ”
56199	56204	56189	56189	he	29	“ On the desk . ”
56239	56243	56244	56244	he	29	“ Forward more , ”
56437	56440	56441	56441	she	503	“ Hunter , ”
56444	56453	56441	56441	she	503	“ Oh , God , keep doing that ! ”
56536	56547	56528	56528	he	29	“ Oh , God , Hunter , keep fucking me . ”
56548	56559	56560	56560	he	29	“ So . . . damn . . . naughty , ”
56567	56577	56560	56560	he	29	“ You ’re such a fucking tease , Gretchen . ”
56578	56582	56583	56583	she	503	“ I am , ”
56586	56598	56583	56583	she	503	“ I like teasing you . You like it , too . ”
56673	56679	56667	56667	she	503	“ Need you , Hunter . ”
56788	56795	56779	56779	She	503	“ Hunter ! Hunter ! Hunter ! ”
56796	56824	56825	56825	He	29	“ I can feel you coming , Gretchen . Ah , damn it . You ’re so tight on my cock . God , I love that . ”
56842	56847	56825	56825	He	29	“ Fuck . Fuck . ”
56848	56851	56852	56852	she	503	“ Yes , ”
56865	56868	56869	56869	he	29	“ Fuck , ”
56986	56991	56992	56992	he	29	“ Ah , Gretchen , ”
56997	57003	56992	56992	he	29	“ Ah , fuck me . ”
57004	57007	57008	57008	she	503	“ Again ? ”
57015	57022	57008	57008	she	503	“ Give a girl a moment . ”
57051	57058	57043	57043	His	29	“ God , that was incredible . ”
57059	57066	57067	57067	she	503	“ Mmmhmm , it sure was , ”
57086	57096	57073	57073	His	29	“ I do n’t want to stop touching you . ”
57124	57134	57097	57097	Her	503	“ We only have the one condom , Hunter . ”
57135	57142	57143	57143	he	29	“ I ’m still in you , ”
57147	57166	57143	57143	he	29	“ And after my shower , I ’m ordering Eldon to get a box of a hundred condoms . ”
57200	57203	57204	57204	She	503	“ Oooh . ”
57232	57248	57225	57225	he	29	“ A hundred condoms ? You ’re very optimistic about either my stamina or yours . ”
57249	57252	57253	57253	he	29	“ Both , ”
57271	57288	57253	57253	he	29	“ I want you to come for me again . This time I want to watch . ”
57454	57457	57458	57458	he	29	“ Beautiful , ”
58231	58235	58228	58228	Gretchen	503	“ Come in . ”
58279	58283	58258	58258	she	503	“ Going out ? ”
58284	58293	58294	58294	He	29	“ I have a . . . meeting . ”
58307	58319	58294	58294	He	29	“ I do n’t know what time I ’ll be back . ”
58320	58329	58330	58330	She	503	“ Oh . Well , that ’s disappointing . ”
58339	58354	58330	58330	She	503	“ I guess I wo n’t stay up and wait for you , then . ”
58355	58358	58359	58359	Hunter	29	“ Actually , ”
58383	58407	58367	58367	He	29	“ If you want to wait in my bed for me , I ’d be happy to wake you up when I return . ”
58408	58411	58412	58412	She	503	“ Mmmm . ”
58429	58434	58412	58412	She	503	“ We ’ll see . ”
58464	58473	58456	58456	he	29	“ I ’ll make it up to you . ”
58474	58477	58478	58478	Gretchen	503	“ Actually , ”
58481	58534	58535	58535	She	503	“ I wanted to talk to you about having a small get - together of some kind . My agent is really pushing for a small house party here , since it ’d give me a good chance to spend time with my editor and tie in the project with the house . ”
58542	58557	58535	58535	She	503	“ Feel free to tell me no . I know this is your house . ”
58571	58577	58563	58563	his	29	“ Would this please you ? ”
58578	58586	58587	58587	she	503	“ Not if it makes you uncomfortable , ”
58592	58632	58587	58587	she	503	“ But it ’d get my agent and my editor off my back for a while , which would be nice . I figured you could invite your friends , though . Maybe that ’d make things less painful . ”
58633	58644	58645	58645	he	29	“ I . . . am not good with strangers , ”
58648	58656	58665	58665	she	503	“ Is it because of your face ? ”
58670	58688	58665	58665	she	503	“ You do n’t have anything to be uncomfortable about . I find your scars incredibly sexy . ”
58696	58705	58689	58689	He	29	“ My scars are not attractive , Gretchen . ”
58706	58715	58716	58716	she	503	“ On anyone else they would n’t be , ”
58750	58759	58731	58731	She	503	“ But on you , they arouse me . ”
58782	58816	58767	58767	he	29	“ I ca n’t miss this meeting , Gretchen . But you ’re making me want to leave early . If you want to have this party , it ’s fine with me . ”
58817	58822	58760	58760	His	29	“ Are you sure ? ”
58853	58878	58849	58849	he	29	“ As long as you ’re in my bed tonight when I come home , you can have as many parties as you want . ”
58879	58885	58886	58886	she	503	“ I ’ll be there , ”
58948	58953	58937	58937	Reese	35	“ I ’m out . ”
58976	58982	58966	58966	he	29	“ You should have stayed . ”
58988	59004	58983	58983	Reese	35	“ I ca n’t read you tonight . You ’re being . . . weird . ”
59005	59008	59009	59009	Griffin	37	“ Weird ? ”
59035	59040	59025	59025	He	35	“ Weird like how ? ”
59041	59047	59048	59048	Reese	35	“ I do n’t know , ”
59063	59077	59052	59052	He	35	“ I ca n’t put my finger on it . It ’s different . ”
59078	59083	59084	59084	Cade	36	“ He ’s happy , ”
59100	59138	59095	59095	Cade	36	“ I ’ve seen him smile twice tonight . He does n’t scowl when someone suggests something , and he ’s actually participated in every conversation and not all of it about business . He ’s happy . ”
59173	59177	59178	59178	He	25	“ Your deal . ”
59238	59243	59226	59226	He	864	“ Everyone ante up . ”
59275	59278	59255	59255	Hunter	29	“ What ? ”
59284	59290	59291	59291	He	25	“ What ’s going on ? ”
59312	59322	59307	59307	Jonathan	38	“ Cade ’s right . You ’re downright cheerful . ”
59328	59339	59323	59323	He	25	“ You ’re one to talk . How ’s Brontë ? ”
59348	59371	59344	59344	Logan	25	“ In a state of crisis . She ’s trying to take classes and expand her reading charity at the same time . ”
59391	59406	59344	59344	Logan	25	“ And she keeps complaining that I wo n’t let her get any sleep . ”
59469	59479	59480	59480	Logan	25	“ It ’s a woman , is n’t it ? ”
59486	59496	59480	59480	Logan	25	“ That redhead you asked Brontë about . Greta ? ”
59497	59500	59501	59501	Hunter	29	“ Gretchen , ”
59512	59521	59501	59501	Hunter	29	“ She ’s the sister of your assistant . ”
59522	59528	59529	59529	Logan	25	“ Audrey has a sister ? ”
59537	59558	59559	59559	His	25	“ Ah , right , the one Brontë stayed with for a time . Brontë likes her quite a bit . ”
59572	59578	59579	59579	Cade	36	“ She has two sisters , ”
59582	59589	59579	59579	Cade	36	“ Daphne lives out in LA . ”
59595	59600	59590	59590	Hunter	29	“ You know them ? ”
59609	59626	59601	59601	Cade	36	“ Old family friends . We go back to childhood . You in on this hand ? ”
59646	59657	59658	59658	he	29	“ Gretchen wants me to invite a few friends over , ”
59665	59672	59658	59658	he	29	“ A party of some kind . ”
59673	59682	59683	59683	Reese	35	“ Does this mean we ’re all invited ? ”
59690	59693	59694	59694	Hunter	29	“ No , ”
59709	59723	59700	59700	Jonathan	38	“ I admit I ’m curious to see this sister of Audrey ’s . ”
59724	59733	59734	59734	Cade	36	“ You ’ve seen one of them before , ”
59738	59742	59734	59734	Cade	36	“ Daphne Petty . ”
59756	59774	59743	59743	Hunter	29	“ No way . Daphne Petty ? The Daphne Petty ? The one in the tabloids constantly ? ”
59775	59781	59782	59782	Logan	25	“ Who ’s Daphne Petty ? ”
59801	59809	59810	59810	Cade	36	“ An old childhood friend of mine , ”
59813	59839	59810	59810	Cade	36	“ And Audrey ’s twin . She ’s also — if rumor has it — heavily into drugs and alcohol , thanks to her career . ”
59840	59844	59845	59845	Logan	25	“ Her career , ”
59849	59855	59845	59845	Logan	25	“ What career is this ? ”
59856	59875	59876	59876	Reese	35	“ Singer . Pick up any magazine and you ’ll probably see her sloppy drunk on the cover , ”
59879	59893	59876	59876	Reese	35	“ Holy crap . I never knew . Audrey looks nothing like her . ”
59899	59916	59894	59894	Cade	36	“ I know . Daphne ’s not . . . well . Audrey ’s much healthier . ”
59991	59996	59984	59984	Gretchen	503	“ mind your own business ”
60014	60019	60020	60020	Jonathan	38	“ Ah , hell , ”
60025	60041	60020	60020	Jonathan	38	“ He ’s grinning again . Whatever it is , he ’s got it bad . ”
60042	60052	60053	60053	Reese	35	“ Now I ’m definitely coming to this party , ”
60056	60062	60063	60063	Hunter	29	“ You were n’t invited , ”
60087	60096	60097	60097	Cade	36	“ You ’re in the Brotherhood , Hunter , ”
60106	60124	60097	60097	Cade	36	“ You know our rules . We ’re all invited . Even the obnoxious ones like Reese . ”
60155	60161	60150	60150	Hunter	29	“ I need your advice . ”
60162	60168	60125	60125	Hunter	29	“ Oh ? On what ? ”
60169	60191	60150	60150	Hunter	29	“ On Gretchen . I want to do something for her . Something that shows her how much I appreciate her . ”
60199	60207	60192	60192	Logan	25	“ Do n’t buy her a diner . ”
60208	60211	60125	60125	Hunter	29	“ What ? ”
60212	60234	60192	60192	Logan	25	“ Nothing . Just something I did for Brontë that backfired in my face . What did you have in mind ? ”
60235	60252	60125	60125	Hunter	29	“ Something . . . thoughtful . Not jewelry . She ’s not a jewelry type . ”
60253	60262	60263	60263	Logan	25	“ Well , you dodged a bullet there , ”
60266	60318	60263	60263	Logan	25	“ Then again , jewelry makes it easy . Brontë ’s not much of a jewelry type , either . Gets mad every time I try to buy her a necklace . The trick is you have to find something that you can do for her that no one else can . ”
60324	60350	60319	60319	Hunter	29	“ I do n’t know what that would be . Property ? It ’s too much . Cars ? Anyone can give her a car . ”
60390	60399	60383	60383	she	872	“ You said she likes books , right ? ”
60400	60406	60383	60383	she	872	“ She ’s a ghostwriter . ”
60410	60424	60407	60407	Logan	25	“ There ’s your answer . Something with books . Is she successful ? ”
60429	60443	60425	60425	Hunter	29	“ I do n’t know . She writes astronaut books or some such . ”
60472	60482	60483	60483	Logan	25	“ So buy them . Buy all of them . ”
60497	60511	60483	60483	Logan	25	“ I should n’t smoke this . Brontë does n’t like the smell . ”
60512	60518	60519	60519	Hunter	29	“ Buy all of them ? ”
60522	60543	60483	60483	Logan	25	“ All the books . Get her on the bestseller list or something . That would probably make her happy . ”
60558	60568	60546	60546	Hunter	29	“ I ’ll get Eldon on it right away . ”
61082	61089	61071	61071	She	503	“ Hunter ? Is that you ? ”
61090	61093	61094	61094	His	29	“ Gretchen . ”
61116	61123	61103	61103	he	29	“ I need you so badly . ”
61134	61143	61144	61144	she	503	“ I was having dirty dreams about you , ”
61147	61152	61144	61144	she	503	“ Am I wet ? ”
61166	61170	61153	61153	He	29	“ Very wet . ”
61171	61177	61178	61178	she	503	“ Then come inside me , ”
61237	61245	61246	61246	she	503	“ Ah , that ’s so good , ”
61260	61267	61249	61249	Her	503	“ Fuck me hard , Hunter . ”
61351	61364	61365	61365	She	503	“ Hunter , oh , God , Hunter . Take me deep . ”
61383	61388	61365	61365	She	503	“ Keep pushing forward . ”
61411	61414	61405	61405	She	503	“ More ! ”
61474	61481	61468	61468	she	503	“ Oh ! I ’m coming ! ”
61577	61585	61586	61586	Gretchen	503	“ Mmm , did you miss me ? ”
61598	61607	61586	61586	Gretchen	503	“ It was a long evening without you . ”
61608	61619	61620	61620	Hunter	29	“ I hope you got a lot of work done , ”
61624	61627	61628	61628	She	503	“ Eh . ”
61634	61640	61641	61641	he	29	“ That ’s too bad , ”
61676	61689	61668	61668	Her	503	“ I do n’t plan on letting you get much sleep tonight . ”
61690	61695	61696	61696	she	503	“ Do n’t you ? ”
61708	61714	61696	61696	she	503	“ Are n’t you tired ? ”
61715	61723	61724	61724	His	29	“ Not when I ’m around you . ”
61741	61749	61724	61724	His	29	“ You bring me back to life . ”
61816	61843	61803	61803	Gretchen	503	“ No . I promise . I need my apartment . I really do . I ’m just doing a project on location at the moment . ”
61844	61855	61856	61857	her landlord	789	“ Your rent is one week overdue , Ms. Petty , ”
61863	61872	61856	61857	her landlord	789	“ And we have n’t seen your check . ”
61873	61883	61884	61884	Gretchen	503	“ What if I give you a check today ? ”
61892	61928	61884	61884	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll call a taxi and head into the city . I ’ll give you a check and I can date it for next week . I should have my contract payment by then . ”
61929	61940	61856	61857	her landlord	789	“ Next week ? Your rent was due last week . ”
61941	61999	61884	61884	Gretchen	503	“ I know ! But I have the payment . I can pay the rest of the entire year with my next check , which should be in any day now . I promise . I can get my agent on the line if you do n’t believe me , and she can confirm the dollar amount . ”
62000	62020	61856	61857	her landlord	789	“ Your contract with us states that rent is due on the first . Not when you get paid . ”
62021	62029	61884	61884	Gretchen	503	“ I know . It ’s just — ”
62049	62055	62039	62039	Eldon	61	“ You have a guest . ”
62056	62063	62064	62064	She	889	“ I . . . what ? ”
62071	62075	62076	62076	he	61	“ A guest , ”
62091	62095	62076	62076	he	61	“ A visitor . ”
62096	62101	62106	62106	she	889	“ Um , okay . ”
62109	62119	62106	62106	she	889	“ Can I call you back in five minutes ? ”
62265	62274	62243	62243	she	503	“ Cooper , what are you doing here ? ”
62289	62298	62275	62275	He	61	“ Hey , Gretchen . There you are . ”
62354	62421	62436	62436	she	503	“ Audrey said you were having a hard time with your project . She said you ’re behind on your deadline and was going to bring you a few things to help out . I told her I was n’t busy and I ’d stop by , and I thought I ’d bring you a little care package from the Cuppa while I was at it . ”
62449	62471	62440	62440	Gretchen	503	“ You ’re a good friend , Coop . Did you bring me the brownie fudge mocha latte flavoring I love ? ”
62472	62476	62477	62477	He	61	“ Of course . ”
62491	62505	62477	62477	He	61	“ You look great , by the way . How are you doing ? ”
62506	62514	62515	62515	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m awesome , of course , ”
62523	62537	62515	62515	Gretchen	503	“ You want to come hang out in the kitchen for a bit ? ”
62538	62546	62547	62547	he	61	“ I would n’t mind a coffee , ”
62557	62567	62547	62547	he	61	“ Here , let me get that for you . ”
62577	62587	62568	62568	She	503	“ I can carry my own boxes , Coop . ”
62588	62598	62547	62547	he	61	“ Yes , but men carry things for ladies . ”
62602	62615	62599	62599	She	503	“ Who are you and what have you done with my friend ? ”
62627	62636	62616	62616	He	61	“ Fair enough . At least I tried . ”
62711	62717	62701	62701	She	503	“ This is from Audrey ? ”
62731	62751	62718	62718	He	61	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re staying here for an entire month . It ’s like a castle . ”
62752	62758	62759	62759	she	503	“ Oh , I know , ”
62774	62782	62759	62759	she	503	“ Complete with creepy butler and everything . ”
62783	62795	62796	62796	he	61	“ I swear this could be something out of a movie , ”
62802	62827	62796	62796	he	61	“ Do n’t tell me . The owner ’s some Phantom of the Opera – style guy intent on sucking the blood of virgins . ”
62847	62851	62836	62836	Cooper	328	“ You okay ? ”
62852	62863	62864	62864	she	503	“ Just . . . breathed . . . wrong , ”
62942	62953	62936	62936	she	503	“ What did Audrey say she was sending me again ? ”
62954	62969	62970	62970	He	61	“ Stress relievers , I think she said . Something to help things along . ”
62978	62990	62970	62970	He	61	“ She said you ’d know what to do with it . ”
63002	63012	62994	62994	he	61	“ I have a pretty good idea , yeah . ”
63021	63025	63018	63018	she	503	“ Bath salts . ”
63026	63032	63068	63068	He	61	“ Ah . Girl stuff . ”
63033	63038	63018	63018	she	503	“ Definitely girl stuff . ”
63060	63067	63048	63048	she	503	“ I think I smell cookies . ”
63081	63090	63071	63071	She	503	“ Two dozen ? You should n’t have . ”
63091	63108	63068	63068	He	61	“ And some toffee dream bars underneath , just in case you want a little variety . ”
63128	63149	63109	63109	She	503	“ You ’re awesome , Cooper . I ’m sure these cookies are n’t as good as mine , though . ”
63150	63160	63161	63161	He	61	“ They should be . It ’s your recipe . ”
63175	63195	63161	63161	He	61	“ I ’ve missed seeing you , Gretchen . The Cuppa is n’t the same without your smiling face . ”
63227	63232	63213	63213	they	899	“ Cooper . . . ”
63233	63244	63197	63197	he	61	“ I ca n’t stop thinking about you , Gretchen . ”
63245	63248	63213	63213	they	899	“ Cooper — ”
63249	63259	63260	63260	His	61	“ No , please , let me say this . ”
63265	63273	63260	63260	His	61	“ It ’s time I said this . ”
63380	63383	63365	63365	He	29	“ I — ”
63384	63390	63391	63391	Hunter	29	“ Introduce us , Gretchen , ”
63440	63455	63422	63422	She	503	“ Cooper , this is . . . Hunter . He owns Buchanan Manor . ”
63456	63474	63475	63475	Hunter	29	“ Yes . The phantom intent on sucking the blood of virgins , I believe you said , ”
63489	63494	63479	63479	Cooper	328	“ Uh . . . ”
63495	63504	63505	63505	She	503	“ Thanks for bringing the box , Cooper . ”
63534	63546	63528	63528	Cooper	328	“ This is going to be really helpful for my deadline . ”
63547	63561	63479	63479	Cooper	328	“ Of course . Anything you need , I ’m here for you . ”
63569	63586	63562	63562	Hunter	29	“ You do n’t need to be here for her . I ’m here for her . ”
63599	63607	63587	63587	Gretchen	503	“ Since you ’re here , Cooper — ”
63608	63618	63619	63619	He	29	“ Actually , I was just about to leave . ”
63634	63651	63587	63587	Gretchen	503	“ Oh , but I was wondering if you could take a check to my landlord — ”
63652	63660	63661	63661	Hunter	29	“ He said he has to go , ”
63665	63677	63661	63661	Hunter	29	“ I ’ll take care of whatever you need , Gretchen . ”
63685	63690	63661	63661	Hunter	29	“ He knows that . ”
63691	63697	63698	63698	Cooper	328	“ I really should go , ”
63707	63714	63661	63661	Hunter	29	“ Eldon will show you out . ”
63753	63765	63766	63766	she	503	“ Thanks again , Cooper . You ’re a good friend , ”
63789	63799	63781	63781	she	503	“ Oh , God , that went really badly . ”
63800	63805	63806	63806	Hunter	29	“ Who was that ? ”
63815	63823	63781	63781	she	503	“ He ’s a friend of mine . ”
63824	63833	63834	63834	Hunter	29	“ He was trying to hit on you , ”
63838	63845	63834	63834	Hunter	29	“ His hand was on yours . ”
63846	63854	63855	63855	she	503	“ Not through any of my doing , ”
63858	63874	63855	63855	she	503	“ I ’ve been trying to figure out a way to let him down easy . ”
63888	63900	63855	63855	she	503	“ Guess I do n’t have to worry about that anymore . ”
63901	63911	63943	63943	Shock	114	“ You did n’t tell him we were together ? ”
63923	63942	63912	63912	She	503	“ Are we together , Hunter ? You ’ve never said and I did n’t want to presume . ”
63948	63953	63943	63943	Shock	114	“ We had sex . ”
63954	63980	63943	63943	Shock	114	“ We had really great sex , Hunter . And I love having sex with you . But it does n’t mean we ’re together . ”
63989	63996	63984	63984	his	29	“ I . . . see . ”
64129	64139	64124	64124	he	29	“ Hunter . That was n’t what I meant . ”
64140	64151	64152	64152	His	29	“ You do n’t have to explain yourself , Gretchen . ”
64159	64165	64152	64152	His	29	“ Spare me your excuses . ”
64166	64204	64124	64124	he	29	“ I ’m not giving you excuses , you prickly jerk . I ’m trying to tell you that if you do n’t want to be with me , I understand . I ’m not dumping you . ”
64209	64212	64213	64213	she	906	“ Hunter ! ”
64228	64253	64213	64213	she	906	“ I like you . I like you a lot . But I did n’t want to assume this was more than it was . ”
64254	64260	64213	64213	she	906	“ You let Cooper assume . ”
64261	64316	64213	64213	she	906	“ Cooper ’s been my friend for years , and he ’s my boss at the coffee shop I occasionally work at . I have to handle him with kid gloves , which is n’t easy when he ’s trying to declare his love every five minutes . I ’m not interested in him . ”
64344	64357	64340	64340	she	907	“ Answer me truthfully , Gretchen . Are you interested in me ? ”
64358	64366	64367	64367	she	907	“ Now that ’s a silly question , ”
64443	64452	64453	64453	she	503	“ I like you more than I should , ”
64457	64513	64453	64453	she	503	“ Someone like you does n’t really belong with someone like me , but I ca n’t seem to stop myself when I ’m with you . I want to kiss you until you ’re blushing , and grab your ass every time I walk past , and do dirty , lascivious things to you . ”
64552	64565	64566	64566	he	29	“ Someone like you is better than what someone like me deserves , ”
64599	64607	64591	64591	he	29	“ You should n’t talk like that . ”
64608	64632	64666	64666	He	29	“ I speak from experience , Gretchen . You ’re the only woman who ’s ever looked at me and not been revolted . ”
64650	64665	64641	64641	she	503	“ Shall I show you just how un - revolted I am by you ? ”
64673	64677	64666	64666	He	29	“ You should . ”
64690	64699	64678	64678	She	503	“ Does the door to this room lock ? ”
64700	64703	64666	64666	He	29	“ No . ”
64716	64730	64704	64704	She	503	“ Then you ’d better hope Eldon does n’t walk in on us . ”
64733	64742	64743	64743	Kat	53	“ You ’re never going to believe this . ”
64750	64756	64743	64743	Kat	53	“ It ’s wicked amazing . ”
64854	64860	64831	64831	she	503	“ My landlord called you ? ”
64861	64880	64831	64831	she	503	“ No . Though I did drop off that check . He was kind of pissy about it . ”
64881	64891	64831	64831	she	503	“ We got the payment in for the contract ? ”
64892	64895	64831	64831	she	503	“ Better . ”
64896	64904	64831	64831	she	503	“ What ’s better than getting paid ? ”
64905	64924	64831	64831	she	503	“ You know Astronaut Bill number forty - two ? Astronaut Bill and the Tragedy of Europa IV ? ”
64925	64944	64945	64945	Gretchen	503	“ That was the one with the rampant disease , right ? Yeah , I hated that book . ”
64950	64983	64945	64945	Gretchen	503	“ The cover sucked and they made me write in a plotline where Bill cheats on Uranea because he thought she was dead and they needed sex in at least three chapters . ”
64984	64995	64945	64945	Gretchen	503	“ It hit the New York Times Best Seller list . ”
65031	65036	65025	65026	her agent	288	“ You ’re joking . ”
65037	65072	65003	65003	She	503	“ I ’m not joking ! You hit number thirty - four . That ’s the extended New York Times list , which is n’t as great as the main list , but whatever . ”
65073	65084	65085	65085	Gretchen	503	“ But . . . but . . . how ? ”
65090	65111	65085	65085	Gretchen	503	“ The majority of the sales are through truck stops and subscriptions . I sell hardly anything through retail outlets . ”
65112	65124	65125	65125	Kat	53	“ Well , you sold a shit - ton last week , ”
65129	65183	65125	65125	Kat	53	“ The team over at Incomparable Books is absolutely thrilled and they want you to do more Bill books . As many as you can work into your schedule this year . They do n’t even care that you ’re late on this other one . Is n’t that awesome ? Steady work ! ”
65184	65187	65188	65188	Gretchen	503	“ Great , ”
65197	65243	65244	65244	Kat	53	“ Sales is trying to figure out what the spike in sales came from , but they ’re super pleased . They say that if sales keep going the way they are , they might even add your name as a byline at some point . ”
65248	65260	65244	65244	Kat	53	“ Just think . You could write under your own name . ”
65261	65264	65265	65265	Gretchen	503	“ Great , ”
65269	65306	65244	65244	Kat	53	“ So how many Bill books do you think you can fit into your schedule this year ? I told them you write fast . At least four , I think . What do you think ? ”
65325	65346	65321	65321	Her	53	“ I ’m not sure . Let me look at my calendar and I ’ll call you back , okay ? ”
65347	65351	65352	65352	Kat	53	“ Will do , ”
65358	65405	65352	65352	Kat	53	“ By the way , I was going to send you flowers but I was n’t sure if it would be apropos since you ’re guesting over there . But I totally thought of flowers for you . I even bought some shoes in your honor . ”
65406	65412	65413	65413	Gretchen	503	“ You ’re so thoughtful , ”
65419	65425	65413	65413	Gretchen	503	“ Call you back soon . ”
65608	65611	65594	65594	Hunter	29	“ Gretchen ? ”
65630	65633	65612	65612	She	503	“ Hey . ”
65665	65670	65646	65646	he	29	“ You ’re upset . ”
65671	65676	65646	65646	he	29	“ It ’s nothing . ”
65677	65696	65646	65646	he	29	“ I do n’t like seeing you upset . Tell me what it is that ’s bothering you . ”
65710	65717	65706	65706	Hunter	29	“ I ’m fine . Really . ”
65728	65736	65718	65718	He	29	“ Is it something I can fix ? ”
65773	65802	65765	65765	she	503	“ I ’m not entirely sure I understand why I ’m upset , myself . So no , I ca n’t ask you to help me fix it . ”
65803	65809	65810	65810	Hunter	29	“ A distraction , then ? ”
65813	65816	65817	65817	she	503	“ Hmmm , ”
65822	65842	65817	65817	she	503	“ Now that has merit . What did you have in mind ? What do you do to relax ? ”
65843	65866	65765	65765	she	503	“ I do n’t know if you want to do what I do . I usually exercise or work in my greenhouse . ”
65872	65887	65867	65867	She	503	“ Yeah , that does n’t exactly sound like fun to me . Sorry . ”
65888	65903	65904	65904	He	29	“ I think you ’re not giving it a fair chance . Come on . ”
66045	66055	66014	66014	He	29	“ Are we here to pick me another rose ? ”
66056	66059	66014	66014	He	29	“ Better . ”
66060	66069	66014	66014	He	29	“ Two roses ? You rebel , you . ”
66070	66073	66074	66074	he	29	“ Better , ”
66078	66085	66074	66074	he	29	“ Which roses are your favorites ? ”
66094	66101	66086	66086	She	503	“ The ones you give me . ”
66102	66112	66086	66086	She	503	“ Do you like a particular color ? Scent ? ”
66119	66132	66113	66113	She	503	“ I liked the blue one you gave me the first day . ”
66133	66137	66086	66086	She	503	“ What else ? ”
66180	66187	66174	66174	He	29	“ Which one is your favorite ? ”
66188	66192	66193	66193	He	29	“ For you ? ”
66215	66234	66193	66193	He	29	“ This one . Papa Meilland . It makes me think of you every time I see it . ”
66254	66257	66246	66246	she	503	“ Why ? ”
66258	66284	66193	66193	He	29	“ The petals are like velvet , the color a deep red like your hair , and no other rose that I own smells sweeter . ”
66290	66296	66285	66285	She	503	“ All very good reasons . ”
66297	66310	66246	66246	she	503	“ It ’s also one of the more difficult ones to grow . ”
66314	66320	66311	66311	She	503	“ You calling me difficult ? ”
66321	66359	66360	66360	He	29	“ It ’s a fragile flower . It looks beautiful and hardy , but even the smallest of ailments can bring it down . It reminds me that some things require a bit more thought and care . ”
66375	66391	66360	66360	He	29	“ It ’s a challenge , but there is no rose sweeter when it blossoms . ”
66392	66409	66360	66360	He	29	“ That ’s beautiful , Hunter . Who knew you would get so poetic over flowers ? ”
66410	66415	66416	66416	he	29	“ Not the roses , ”
66432	66442	66360	66360	He	29	“ So what did you want to show me ? ”
66443	66454	66360	66360	He	29	“ One of my passions is the hybridization of roses . ”
66455	66469	66360	66360	He	29	“ Wow . Sounds . . . um , boring . I think . ”
66497	66516	66485	66486	Papa Meilland	117	“ I wanted to choose something you ’d like . I ’d like to create you a rose . ”
66523	66529	66518	66518	he	29	“ Create me a rose ? ”
66610	66613	66614	66614	he	29	“ Hybridization , ”
66638	66690	66614	66614	he	29	“ Is how all the different varieties of hybrid tea roses are created . They ’ve been bred and crossbred with each other for the best qualities — long stems , bright colors , lovely scents . I ’d like to see if I can cross a rose just for you . ”
66691	66700	66701	66701	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m always game for a present , ”
66704	66715	66701	66701	Gretchen	503	“ So when do I get to see my rose ? ”
66739	66782	66729	66729	he	29	“ These things take time . It ’s a slow process of pollination and experimentation . I ’ll have to take one of the Blue Girl roses — that ’s the one you liked — that ’s budding and force it open — ”
66783	66795	66800	66800	he	29	“ Pollination , experimentation , and forcing petals ? Sounds kinky . ”
66823	66850	66800	66800	he	29	“ You do that to prepare it for pollination from the other rose . They ’re covered to prevent them from being pollinated from another rose . ”
66851	66857	66858	66858	He	29	“ Rose condoms . Gotcha . ”
66887	66893	66879	66879	she	503	“ Do you always interrupt ? ”
66894	66905	66879	66879	she	503	“ Yes . But do n’t let that stop you . ”
66906	66918	66879	66879	she	503	“ I wo n’t . Do you want to hear more ? ”
66919	66922	66923	66923	she	503	“ Absolutely , ”
66926	66939	66923	66923	she	503	“ This is as dirty as those letters I ’ve been reading . ”
66955	67008	66940	66940	He	29	“ We want the Papa Meilland to bloom and mature . Once it has , we take the pollen from the Papa Meilland and transfer it to the Blue Girl . We let the Blue Girl go to seed , collect those , and plant them to see what we ’ve created . ”
67009	67012	67013	67013	she	503	“ Hmm , ”
67025	67036	67013	67013	she	503	“ This is n’t a fast hobby , is it . ”
67037	67044	66940	66940	He	29	“ I ’m a patient man . ”
67045	67055	67013	67013	she	503	“ You think long term , do n’t you ? ”
67165	67177	67143	67143	he	29	“ I love you , Gretchen . Do n’t be sad . ”
67196	67211	67188	67188	She	503	“ Hunter , I . . . I do n’t know what to say . ”
67212	67218	67219	67219	His	29	“ Do n’t say anything . ”
67242	67313	67219	67219	His	29	“ I ’ve never met anyone like you . If I live to be a hundred , I ’ll never feel as deeply for anyone as I feel for you right now . You bring light and sunshine to my life . I ’m not telling you that I love you to make you unhappy . I ’m telling you thank you . Thank you for coming into my life . ”
67333	67341	67342	67342	he	919	“ Do n’t say anything , Gretchen , ”
67345	67412	67342	67342	he	919	“ I ’m a practical man . I never thought to have a woman in my life , ever . I thought my face would turn off any woman worth having . I never thought I would be lucky enough to meet someone like you . I have no illusions as to what this means to you , but for me , it is the world . ”
67422	67431	67413	67413	She	503	“ Sounds like fate ’s brought us together . ”
67432	67435	67436	67436	he	919	“ Yes , ”
67446	67449	67436	67436	he	919	“ Fate . ”
68243	68259	68260	68260	She	503	“ Hell , Igor . Now I ’ve gone all moony , have n’t I ? ”
68324	68337	68338	68338	she	503	“ You just tell me if I ’m being ridiculous , cat , ”
68848	68851	68836	68836	Gretchen	503	“ Enter . ”
68937	68941	68942	68942	Hunter	29	“ Finished working ? ”
68948	68953	68942	68942	Hunter	29	“ It ’s early . ”
68954	68959	68960	68960	Gretchen	503	“ Just momentarily distracted , ”
68990	68996	68974	68974	She	503	“ Am I bothering you ? ”
68997	69000	69001	69001	he	29	“ Yes , ”
69017	69025	69005	69005	His	29	“ But I do n’t mind it . ”
69046	69057	69026	69026	She	503	“ You ’re going to make me forget my mission . ”
69058	69061	69026	69026	She	503	“ Mission ? ”
69062	69065	69066	69066	She	503	“ Mmmhmm . ”
69088	69097	69066	69066	She	503	“ I ’m looking for a secret passage . ”
69098	69103	69080	69080	his	29	“ Is that so ? ”
69104	69112	69113	69113	she	503	“ It ’s mentioned in the letters , ”
69145	69155	69132	69132	She	503	“ Where are the other libraries in the house ? ”
69161	69168	69156	69156	Hunter	29	“ There ’s no secret passage . ”
69169	69173	69174	69174	she	503	“ There is , ”
69186	69230	69174	69174	she	503	“ I swear I ’m not lying . They go on and on about it in the letters . I thought it would be terrific to see . We could take pictures of it and add some excitement and reality to the book . ”
69235	69242	69231	69231	His	29	“ There ’s no secret passage . ”
69243	69254	69174	69174	she	503	“ Of course there is . Just look at this . ”
69286	69296	69174	69174	she	503	“ Wow , what ’s crawled into your panties ? ”
69297	69300	69301	69301	He	29	“ Nothing . ”
69306	69312	69301	69301	He	29	“ I ’m just tired . ”
69313	69325	69326	69326	She	503	“ Then will you quit acting like I ’m bothering you ? ”
69343	69354	69326	69326	She	503	“ I do n’t know what the big deal is . ”
69375	69381	69382	69382	he	29	“ You never bother me , ”
69386	69398	69382	69382	he	29	“ My day is better every time I see your face . ”
69417	69426	69399	69399	She	503	“ Then help me find this secret passage . ”
69437	69468	69427	69427	He	29	“ The house underwent many renovations over the last fifty years . The main library was destroyed . If there was a secret room , it ’s there no longer . ”
69486	69497	69427	69427	He	29	“ I ’m sorry . I know it ’s disappointing . ”
69498	69501	69502	69502	Gretchen	503	“ Oh . ”
69510	69533	69502	69502	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s a shame . I was hoping to see it . I ’m sorry to have bothered you , then . ”
69551	69565	69539	69539	he	29	“ Gretchen , you are never a bother . I ’m just distracted . ”
69566	69570	69535	69535	she	503	“ By what ? ”
69571	69579	69539	69539	he	29	“ Work . . . and you . ”
69588	69602	69580	69580	She	503	“ Well , if I ’m bothering you , I ’ll just go . ”
69615	69634	69603	69603	He	29	“ No you do n’t . Now that you have my attention , you ’re not going anywhere . ”
69635	69640	69580	69580	She	503	“ Is that so ? ”
69641	69645	69646	69646	His	29	“ It is . ”
69659	69670	69646	69646	His	29	“ I ca n’t help myself . You look ravishing . ”
69674	69686	69671	69671	She	503	“ I ’m wearing a T - shirt and yoga pants . ”
69687	69692	69603	69603	He	29	“ You always do . ”
69693	69704	69671	69671	She	503	“ Now is that some slight upon my wardrobe choices ? ”
69705	69726	69603	69603	He	29	“ No , that ’s me telling you that I find you impossible to resist every time I see you . ”
69804	69813	69789	69789	She	503	“ So there ’s no more secret passage ? ”
69814	69817	69789	69789	She	503	“ Nope . ”
69818	69830	69831	69831	she	503	“ Then it seems like I came in here for nothing , ”
69835	69840	69841	69841	he	29	“ Not for nothing , ”
69844	69854	69841	69841	he	29	“ I think I have something to show you . ”
69855	69858	69789	69789	She	503	“ Oh ? ”
69859	69875	69841	69841	he	29	“ In my room . Perhaps you ’d like to search it for secret passages . ”
69876	69888	69789	69789	She	503	“ What are the odds of me finding one in there ? ”
69889	69892	69893	69893	he	29	“ Slim , ”
69907	69915	69893	69893	he	29	“ But there ’s always that chance . ”
69916	69924	69925	69925	She	503	“ Sounds like my kind of party . ”
70234	70243	70228	70228	his	61	“ You called for me , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
70253	70266	70244	70244	Hunter	29	“ You did n’t read these before purchasing them , did you . ”
70273	70295	70267	70267	Eldon	61	“ I did not . I procured them as you wished , but my instructions never included reading the letters myself . ”
70296	70303	70304	70304	Hunter	29	“ They mention a secret room . ”
70319	70327	70304	70304	Hunter	29	“ Gretchen came here looking for it . ”
70351	70358	70342	70342	His	29	“ This letter is quite vulgar . ”
70372	70386	70359	70359	Hunter	29	“ They ’re all quite vulgar , or did n’t you know that ? ”
70397	70440	70392	70392	he	29	“ This is supposed to be a very innocent batch of letters , Eldon . From Buchanan Manor . Not some other nameless house with secret doors and libraries . If she finds out this is a fraud , she ’ll leave . ”
70451	70463	70392	70392	he	29	“ I do n’t want her leaving here . Leaving me . ”
70464	70471	70472	70472	Eldon	61	“ She ’s not a dog , ”
70479	70492	70472	70472	Eldon	61	“ She ’s allowed to leave your property on her own wishes . ”
70500	70517	70493	70493	He	29	“ You know what I mean . I want her here for as long as possible . ”
70535	70549	70525	70525	He	61	“ You do realize she ’s almost done with the project , Buchanan ? ”
70555	70572	70550	70550	Hunter	29	“ I thought she was here for a full month . How long has it been ? ”
70573	70596	70525	70525	He	61	“ A little over three weeks . And she ’s nearly done with the trunk . She ’ll be leaving very soon . ”
70622	70627	70630	70630	him	61	“ I . . . ”
70637	70641	70632	70632	He	61	“ Fix this . ”
70655	70667	70642	70642	Eldon	61	“ Fix this ? Or fix the part about her leaving ? ”
70668	70674	70642	70642	Eldon	61	“ Yes . To both . ”
70675	70688	70642	70642	Eldon	61	“ Very well . Shall I shackle her left leg or right ? ”
70694	70700	70689	70689	Hunter	29	“ That ’s not funny . ”
70701	70714	70642	70642	Eldon	61	“ What do you suggest I do to prevent her from leaving ? ”
70724	70755	70715	70715	Hunter	29	“ I do n’t know . Just think of something . She needs to stay longer . I ’m not ready for her to leave my side . Not yet . ”
70756	70760	70761	70761	Eldon	61	“ I see . ”
70772	70781	70761	70761	Eldon	61	“ I shall see what I can do . ”
70782	70786	70787	70787	Hunter	29	“ Thank you , ”
70791	70806	70787	70787	Hunter	29	“ Do this for me and I ’ll see that you ’re well compensated . ”
70807	70812	70813	70813	Eldon	61	“ You always do , ”
70835	70852	70828	70828	his	61	“ You seem troubled , Mr. Buchanan . Would you like to . . . talk ? ”
70874	70879	70861	70861	Hunter	29	“ I ’m fine . ”
70880	70896	70861	70861	Hunter	29	“ You do n’t seem fine , if you do n’t mind me saying so . ”
70897	70904	70905	70905	He	29	“ I ’m not , actually . ”
70915	70925	70905	70905	He	29	“ But I will be once you fix that . ”
70941	70955	70926	70926	He	29	“ I ’m heading back to bed , Eldon . Get some sleep . ”
70956	70960	70961	70961	Eldon	61	“ Of course , ”
71189	71200	71180	71180	He	29	“ Come back to bed . It ’s too early . ”
71201	71205	71206	71206	she	503	“ Ca n’t , ”
71238	71253	71224	71224	He	29	“ Nice try , but I ’ve got a lot of work to do . ”
71260	71264	71254	71254	He	29	“ Come back . ”
71269	71289	71265	71265	She	503	“ Nope . Ca n’t . You sleep , though . You were up too late last night working . ”
71334	71343	71344	71344	he	29	“ I ’ll get up in a minute , ”
71613	71627	71628	71628	She	503	“ Oh , no . Did I leave you in here all night ? ”
71642	71678	71628	71628	She	503	“ I ’ve been neglecting you shamefully , have n’t I ? I ca n’t help it . I ’ve got a new man in my life and he does n’t even need kitty litter . ”
71752	71759	71760	71760	She	503	“ No , no , no ! ”
72367	72370	72359	72359	His	29	“ Gretchen ? ”
72388	72405	72406	72406	Her	503	“ Oh . Hi . Sorry . I was just , um . . . working . ”
72443	72450	72451	72451	he	29	“ Tell me what ’s wrong , ”
72506	72510	72511	72511	she	503	“ My book , ”
72517	72522	72511	72511	she	503	“ It ’s gone . ”
72541	72544	72545	72545	he	29	“ Gone ? ”
72551	72555	72545	72545	he	29	“ What happened ? ”
72556	72565	72566	72566	she	503	“ Igor must have knocked over the vase , ”
72576	72586	72566	72566	she	503	“ The laptop is soaked . It ’s ruined . ”
72599	72617	72594	72594	Hunter	29	“ We ’ll fix it . I ’ll call someone to come take a look at it . ”
72632	72651	72618	72618	She	503	“ It ’s my fault . I left Igor in here all night . I ’m so stupid . ”
72652	72657	72658	72658	he	29	“ You are not , ”
72684	72696	72673	72673	He	29	“ You ’re not stupid , Gretchen . Not by far . ”
72697	72707	72708	72708	she	503	“ I should have emailed my backups to Kat , ”
72712	72718	72719	72719	She	503	“ I just . . . ”
72722	72727	72673	72673	He	29	“ You just what ? ”
72735	72771	72728	72728	She	503	“ The more I work , the less I seem to enjoy it . That ’s all . I guess I ’ve been avoiding Kat . Talking with her just feels like too much pressure . ”
72833	72839	72840	72840	he	29	“ We ’ll fix this , ”
72848	72862	72840	72840	he	29	“ Give me your laptop . I ’ll send it off with Eldon . ”
72863	72868	72869	72869	she	503	“ O - okay , ”
72899	72941	72886	72886	He	29	“ I ’m going to send this off with him and instruct the technicians to not come back until they ’ve recovered your files . But for the rest of the day , we ’re going to relax and enjoy ourselves . ”
72942	72950	72996	72996	He	29	“ I do n’t think I can . ”
72951	72976	72886	72886	He	29	“ Oh , you can . And we ’re not going to think about work . We ’re just going to enjoy each other . ”
72984	72995	72977	72977	She	503	“ What if I have to start over , Hunter ? ”
73101	73107	73096	73096	Hunter	29	“ I ’ll be back . ”
73108	73114	73115	73115	she	503	“ I ’ll be here , ”
73234	73241	73227	73227	Hunter	29	“ Your work , I assume ? ”
73257	73262	73263	73263	Hunter	29	“ She ’s crying , ”
73272	73280	73267	73267	He	29	“ I did n’t want her upset . ”
73281	73288	73289	73289	Eldon	61	“ You said to fix it , ”
73296	73314	73315	73315	He	29	“ You did n’t say how . You needed her work to continue to keep her here . ”
73321	73332	73315	73315	He	29	“ I have ensured that , just as you asked . ”
73375	73390	73391	73391	He	29	“ Take the laptop to a technician . See if they can fix it . ”
73403	73410	73391	73391	He	29	“ Not too soon , though . ”
73411	73419	73420	73420	Eldon	61	“ I shall escort it in myself , ”
73427	73451	73420	73420	Eldon	61	“ I am sure that no one will get to it for at least a week , no matter how much I ask . ”
73452	73455	73391	73391	He	29	“ Good . ”
73456	73465	73420	73420	Eldon	61	“ And if the file can be recovered ? ”
73497	73512	73481	73481	His	29	“ I . . . I ’ll cross that bridge when I get there . ”
73513	73517	73518	73518	Eldon	61	“ Very well , ”
73525	73541	73481	73481	His	29	“ Cancel my meetings today . I ’m going to spend the day with Gretchen . ”
73542	73546	73547	73547	Eldon	61	“ Very well , ”
73658	73690	73651	73651	Kleenex	125	“ I think I can come up with a system of some kind . Not all of the letters are important , so if I make a pile of the ones — ”
73691	73694	73695	73695	he	61	“ No , ”
73729	73739	73709	73709	He	61	“ Today , we ’re taking the day off . ”
73740	73745	73746	73746	She	503	“ I ca n’t . ”
73767	73795	73796	73796	He	61	“ If I have to recreate the document , I need to get started right away . I ca n’t afford to lose any time . I — ”
73809	73841	73796	73796	He	61	“ Gretchen , you work every day . Even on weekends . You can take a day off . When was the last time you had a day off from writing ? ”
73855	73861	73842	73842	She	503	“ I ’m not sure . ”
73862	73880	73881	73881	He	61	“ You ’re stressed and you ’re unhappy . I do n’t like seeing you like this . ”
73894	73912	73881	73881	He	61	“ Take a day off . I ’ve cancelled all my meetings . We can just relax . ”
73913	73918	73842	73842	She	503	“ But my projects — ”
73919	73925	73881	73881	He	61	“ Can wait one day . ”
73939	73961	73881	73881	He	61	“ You can call your agent in the morning and explain what happened and tell her you need a deadline extension . ”
73962	73971	73972	73972	Gretchen	503	“ She ’s not going to be happy . ”
74171	74190	74160	74160	Gretchen	503	“ I think that was me . I guess I got so distracted that I did n’t eat . ”
74191	74199	74147	74147	Her	503	“ Shall I have Eldon prepare something ? ”
74205	74237	74200	74200	She	503	“ I ’m a much better cook than he is . You have n’t tried my three - cheese omelet yet , have you ? It ’ll make you a believer . ”
74244	74254	74255	74255	he	981	“ I ’m willing to give it a try , ”
74269	74280	74255	74255	he	981	“ But I ’m not a big fan of eggs . ”
74281	74289	74290	74290	she	503	“ I ’ll make you a fan , ”
74298	74309	74290	74290	she	503	“ Come on . I ’ll make you a treat . ”
74321	74341	74310	74310	He	981	“ Today ’s about your day of rest , Gretchen . I do n’t want you waiting on me . ”
74355	74373	74342	74342	She	503	“ Cooking ’s not a chore , silly . It ’s fun . Now , come on . ”
74494	74531	74532	74532	She	984	“ I swear , Eldon lets most of this food go to waste . I ’m going to make some muffins for the cleaning crew . It seems a shame not to use up these groceries . ”
74545	74554	74532	74532	She	984	“ This is lame , is n’t it ? ”
74566	74572	74555	74555	He	981	“ What do you mean ? ”
74584	74600	74573	74573	She	984	“ Me . Cooking . You think it ’s stupid and you ’re probably bored . ”
74601	74606	74640	74640	She	984	“ Not at all . ”
74627	74639	74614	74614	Gretchen	503	“ I like watching you work . I do n’t mind . ”
74663	74676	74640	74640	She	984	“ That ’s funny . You never want to watch me write . ”
74677	74688	74689	74689	he	981	“ You do n’t look as happy when you write , ”
74708	74714	74689	74689	he	981	“ You look happy now . ”
74733	74755	74715	74715	Gretchen	503	“ Writing ’s my job . I do n’t do it because I love it . It just pays the bills . ”
74779	74811	74756	74756	She	503	“ I thought when I first started that writing would be an amazing job . Spend all day in your pajamas and no one to answer to but yourself , right ? ”
74812	74816	74715	74715	Gretchen	503	“ I suppose . ”
74851	74897	74898	74898	She	503	“ Yeah , well , I get to spend all day in my pajamas , but it seems like I have more bosses and deadlines than ever before . And I ’m not crazy about the work . Like . . . not at all . ”
74919	74936	74898	74898	She	503	“ I kind of hate it , actually . Fucking astronauts and their stupid bimbo girlfriends . ”
74937	74944	74954	74954	He	981	“ What are you talking about ? ”
74945	74953	74898	74898	She	503	“ You know . My ghostwriting work . ”
75003	75015	75000	75000	Gretchen	503	“ So what would you do if you could do anything ? ”
75022	75030	75016	75016	Gretchen	503	“ Be right here ? With you ? ”
75307	75312	75288	75288	She	503	“ Want to taste ? ”
75418	75437	75410	75410	they	1000	“ Is it too early in the day to throw you down on the floor and fuck you ? ”
75447	75456	75438	75438	Her	503	“ God , no . Never too early . ”
75457	75462	75463	75463	he	29	“ Then come here , ”
75560	75574	75545	75545	she	503	“ It does n’t take much to get you going , does it ? ”
75575	75583	75584	75584	he	29	“ Not when it comes to you , ”
75630	75639	75617	75617	She	503	“ Oh , Hunter , that feels amazing . ”
75640	75649	75650	75650	he	29	“ I want to make you feel good , ”
75663	75670	75650	75650	he	29	“ Tell me what you want . ”

75717	75724	75704	75704	He	29	“ Yes . God , yes . ”
75731	75751	75725	75725	She	503	“ Wait . What about the staff ? What if they see us ? Maybe we should hide somewhere . ”
75774	75781	75770	75770	she	503	“ We need condoms , too . ”
75797	75807	75784	75784	He	29	“ Fine . We ’ll go to your room . ”
75808	75822	75823	75823	she	503	“ So far away ? It ’s an entire hall or two down , ”
75826	75838	75823	75823	she	503	“ I do n’t know if I can walk that far . ”
75852	75859	75839	75839	He	29	“ Then I ’ll carry you . ”
75880	75889	75860	75860	She	503	“ I was joking . I can walk . ”
75905	75913	75890	75890	Hunter	29	“ But I like to carry you . ”
75933	75940	75918	75918	she	503	“ I ’m out of objections . ”
76120	76126	76127	76127	she	503	“ Do n’t stop moving , ”
76150	76156	76140	76140	He	29	“ Gretchen , do n’t . ”
76157	76163	76164	76164	She	503	“ Do n’t do this ? ”
76186	76194	76178	76178	her	503	“ I want you deep inside me . ”
76229	76232	76233	76233	she	503	“ Mmm , ”
76241	76256	76233	76233	she	503	“ I liked it when you held me . Felt so close to you . ”
76268	76297	76257	76257	He	29	“ We do n’t have to stop . We can make love like that , with me holding you . I just need to get a condom on . ”
76321	76328	76298	76298	She	503	“ I ’m not too heavy ? ”
76329	76334	76335	76335	He	29	“ Not at all . ”
76353	76359	76335	76335	He	29	“ Shall I show you ? ”
76360	76363	76364	76364	she	503	“ Absolutely , ”
76523	76538	76539	76539	He	29	“ You taste so sweet , Gretchen . Sweeter than anything I ’ve tasted . ”
76554	76563	76539	76539	He	29	“ I ca n’t get enough of you . ”
76564	76570	76571	76571	Her	503	“ Then do n’t stop . ”
76588	76598	76584	76584	he	29	“ Oh , God , do n’t ever stop . ”
76599	76605	76606	76606	he	29	“ But you ’ll come , ”
76645	76651	76627	76627	She	503	“ Why are you stopping ? ”
76652	76661	76662	76662	he	29	“ Because I need to be inside you , ”
76671	76675	76662	76662	he	29	“ Right now . ”
76699	76707	76708	76708	he	29	“ Put your arms around my neck , ”
76781	76784	76785	76785	Gretchen	503	“ Oh , ”
76788	76794	76785	76785	Gretchen	503	“ You ’re so deep . ”
76866	76870	76848	76848	His	29	“ Feel good ? ”
76900	76910	76871	76871	She	503	“ Oh , Hunter , do n’t drop me . ”
76911	76914	76915	76915	He	29	“ Never . ”
76935	76943	76927	76927	Her	503	“ I wo n’t let you go . ”
76965	76970	76952	76952	he	29	“ Harder , Hunter . ”
77013	77018	77019	77019	she	503	“ What . . . ”
77082	77089	77072	77072	her	503	“ Oh ! Just like that ! ”
77197	77200	77201	77201	she	503	“ Hunter , ”
77204	77209	77210	77210	he	29	“ I ’m here , ”
77226	77232	77233	77233	Her	503	“ I ’ve got you . ”
77697	77705	77706	77706	Hunter	29	“ We could have had this catered , ”
77741	77770	77722	77722	She	503	“ How many times do I have to tell you ? I like cooking . Besides , this is only ten additional people . I can handle that . ”
78363	78374	78352	78352	Gretchen	503	“ What time did we ask everyone to get here ? ”
78378	78392	78375	78375	Hunter	29	“ It should n’t matter . It ’s just a gathering of friends . ”
78399	78407	78408	78408	Gretchen	503	“ Poor baby . Are you nervous ? ”
78433	78443	78408	78408	Gretchen	503	“ You should n’t be . You look amazing . ”
78453	78470	78444	78444	His	29	“ You ’re the one no one will be able to take their eyes off of . ”
78471	78474	78475	78475	She	503	“ Flatterer . ”
78557	78575	78538	78538	She	503	“ With that glib tongue , I think you ’ll do just fine at this party tonight . ”
78583	78597	78576	78576	He	29	“ Not so sure about that . You know I do n’t entertain . ”
78598	78604	78538	78538	She	503	“ Not even your friends ? ”
78610	78618	78605	78605	He	29	“ I ’ve never invited them here . ”
78642	78656	78634	78634	she	503	“ Well , I ’m here tonight . You let me handle everything . ”
78716	78733	78710	78710	Someone	127	“ Dinner and a show . You really know how to treat your guests , Hunter . ”
78846	78856	78839	78839	His	29	“ Come . Let me introduce you to Reese . ”
78882	78889	78890	78890	she	503	“ You ’re our first guest , ”
78894	78904	78890	78890	she	503	“ You must be one of Hunter ’s friends . ”
78905	78917	78918	78918	He	29	“ I am . You must be Hunter ’s new ladylove . ”
78933	78939	78918	78918	He	29	“ I applaud his taste . ”
78940	78943	78968	78968	She	503	“ Thanks . ”
78944	78957	78958	78958	Reese	35	“ I do hope Hunter does n’t monopolize you the entire evening , ”
78980	78995	78968	78968	She	503	“ Cool your jets , lover boy . I ’m not into dual penetration . ”
79007	79015	78996	78996	He	35	“ I see why you like her . ”
79245	79257	79224	79224	He	36	“ I ’m so pleased that you ’re here , Gretchen . ”
79265	79273	79258	79258	She	503	“ A bad Petty always turns up . ”
79288	79303	79274	79274	He	36	“ Look at you . Gorgeous . Not an ounce of bad in you . ”
79312	79323	79304	79304	She	503	“ I did n’t know you were friends with Cade . ”
79324	79331	79332	79332	Cade	36	“ We go back to college , ”
79340	79350	79351	79351	she	503	“ Not nearly as far back as we do , ”
79369	79380	79381	79381	Hunter	29	“ I see I do n’t need to give introductions , ”
79388	79403	79404	79404	Gretchen	503	“ You can , if it ’ll stop Cade from giving me a noogie , ”
79416	79450	79407	79407	Cade	36	“ I have n’t given a girl a noogie ever since I discovered they do n’t have cooties , Gretchen . I think we ’ve missed out on a few years in between . ”
79461	79498	79499	79499	she	503	“ Cade grew up on the same street as I did . The twins , Cade , and I were the only children in the neighborhood , so we tended to play together quite a bit , ”
79509	79522	79503	79503	Gretchen	503	“ You know Audrey ’s going to be here tonight , too . ”
79526	79550	79523	79523	He	29	“ I ’m not surprised . She ’s Logan ’s assistant , correct ? Sometimes she shows up at these sorts of functions . ”
79579	79594	79595	79596	Another pair	1035	“ That ’s right . I ’m sure she ’d love to catch up . ”
79832	79857	79858	79858	Gretchen	503	“ Your sister is here , Ms. Petty . And she has brought a . . . problem . Could you please follow me ? ”
79863	79867	79868	79868	She	503	“ Of course . ”
79904	79910	79894	79894	She	503	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
79911	79918	79919	79919	Eldon	61	“ Follow me , Ms. Petty , ”
79926	79932	79919	79919	Eldon	61	“ You ’ll soon see . ”
80105	80111	80112	80112	she	26	“ Oh , hey sis , ”
80115	80129	80112	80112	she	26	“ Heard you were having a party and thought I ’d crash it . ”
80132	80140	80141	80141	Audrey	26	“ I ’m so sorry , Gretchen , ”
80158	80172	80141	80141	Audrey	26	“ She showed up earlier today and I could n’t leave her alone . ”
80173	80178	80179	80179	Gretchen	503	“ It ’s okay , ”
80190	80200	80179	80179	Gretchen	503	“ Hey , Daph . How ’s it going ? ”
80201	80204	80205	80205	Daphne	1622	“ Greaaat , ”
80273	80289	80262	80262	She	1622	“ I ’m avoiding my manager . He ’s trying to take my money again . ”
80290	80299	80300	80300	Gretchen	503	“ You mean put you on an allowance ? ”
80311	80321	80300	80300	Gretchen	503	“ Can we add another seat to the party ? ”
80322	80332	80333	80333	Eldon	61	“ Are you sure you want to do that ? ”
80357	80363	80364	80364	Daphne	1622	“ ’ Course she does , ”
80380	80394	80371	80371	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m the entertainment . Do n’t you know who I am ? ”
80395	80411	80412	80412	Gretchen	503	“ He does n’t care who you are , and you ’re not the entertainment , ”
80416	80422	80423	80423	Audrey	26	“ I ’m really sorry , ”
80430	80455	80423	80423	Audrey	26	“ I did n’t know what else to do . Should we leave her in a room somewhere to let her sleep it off ? ”
80456	80467	80371	80371	Gretchen	503	“ Can we trust her not to steal the silver ? ”
80468	80473	80423	80423	Audrey	26	“ Um , no . ”
80474	80488	80489	80489	Gretchen	503	“ Then no , we ca n’t . This is Hunter ’s house . ”
80492	80515	80489	80489	Gretchen	503	“ Come on . Let ’s introduce my junkie sister to my boyfriend and my new editor . This ’ll be fun . ”
80542	80558	80559	80559	Gretchen	503	“ Hi , everyone . This is my sister Audrey and her twin , Daphne . ”
80598	80609	80588	80588	Kat	53	“ Oh , my God . Is that . . . ”
80616	80628	80588	80588	Kat	53	“ You ’re Daphne Petty ’s sister ? The Daphne Petty ? ”
80629	80639	80640	80642	The editorial assistant	1060	“ Daphne ! I am such a big fan . ”
80654	80674	80640	80642	The editorial assistant	1060	“ I loved your first album . I even saw you on tour in 2010 with the Lipstick Project . ”
80675	80682	80683	80683	Daphne	1622	“ Yeah , that was me , ”
80708	80770	80691	80691	She	1622	“ They sucked , did n’t they ? That fucking tour was a nightmare . Hated every moment of it . Could n’t wait to get backstage and get loaded every night , just to get through the goddamn day . The drugs were the only thing that made it worth it . Shit , they had some fine ass drugs . ”
80780	80793	80771	80771	She	1622	“ You do n’t have any drugs on you , do you ? ”
80794	80797	80798	80800	The editorial assistant	1060	“ Um . ”
80812	80815	80816	80816	Gretchen	503	“ Daph , ”
80823	80828	80829	80829	Daphne	1622	“ Oooh , wine , ”
80837	80841	80842	80842	Audrey	26	“ No wine ! ”
80850	80867	80868	80868	Kat	53	“ I ca n’t believe you did n’t tell me that Daphne Petty was your sister , ”
80873	80904	80868	80868	Kat	53	“ She is a gold mine of Hollywood gossip . Do you think she ’d let us do an autobiography ? We could sell it . We ’re talking millions . ”
80905	80910	80911	80911	Gretchen	503	“ No , Kat , ”
80923	80937	80911	80911	Gretchen	503	“ She ’s not interested and neither am I. Her life is private . ”
80938	80943	80944	80944	Kat	53	“ Not that private , ”
80948	80991	80944	80944	Kat	53	“ She ’s in the tabloids every week . Is it true that her manager has her on a strict allowance ? Is it true that she slept with Thomas Steele and aborted his baby ? That her label assigns her handlers ? ”
80999	81013	80992	80992	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m serious . Drop it . Daphne ’s off the table . ”
81026	81059	81014	81014	Kat	53	“ I ’m just saying . You know where to go if she ever needs an influx of cash . Which , according to Star Trax magazine , is any day now . ”
81118	81152	81111	81111	Brontë	172	“ I hate to break in to the conversation , ladies , but dinner ’s going to be served in a few minutes . Gretchen , where do you want to seat Daphne ? ”
81173	81196	81156	81156	Daphne	1622	“ Put her on the far end of the table . Let ’s make sure nothing but water gets close to Daphne . ”
81232	81238	81239	81239	Hunter	29	“ Is everything all right ? ”
81258	81263	81250	81250	his	29	“ You look unhappy . ”
81264	81268	81269	81269	she	503	“ Just surprised , ”
81274	81289	81269	81269	she	503	“ Though I should n’t be . Daphne just brings trouble wherever she goes . ”
81290	81303	81250	81250	his	29	“ Do you want me to have her escorted off the premises ? ”
81304	81307	81308	81308	Gretchen	503	“ No . ”
81313	81331	81308	81308	Gretchen	503	“ Let ’s just try and ignore her through dinner . I think Brontë has her handled . ”
81406	81409	81410	81410	Daphne	1622	“ Wait , ”
81413	81419	81410	81410	Daphne	1622	“ Where ’s my sister ? ”
81447	81453	81454	81454	Daphne	1622	“ Oh , my God , ”
81466	81473	81457	81457	She	1622	“ That dude is fucking hideous . ”
81515	81528	81507	81507	She	503	“ Daphne , this is my . . . boyfriend , Hunter . ”
81563	81572	81554	81554	Daphne	1622	“ He ’s like a bad acid trip . ”
81573	81584	81554	81554	Daphne	1622	“ Daph ! Stop it ! You ’re embarrassing me . ”
81588	81599	81585	81585	Daphne	1622	“ Me ? What about Quasimodo at your side there ? ”
81600	81605	81606	81606	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s enough , ”
81626	81662	81612	81612	She	503	“ I do n’t care if you ’re my sister . If you ca n’t be polite , you ’re out of here . I ’m going to call your manager and rat you out . ”
81663	81671	81672	81672	Audrey	26	“ Daphne , please just be quiet , ”
81681	81684	81672	81672	Audrey	26	“ Please . ”
81699	81722	81685	81685	Daphne	1622	“ Why are your panties in such a wad , Gretchen ? So you ’re dating an ugly dude . So what . ”
81727	81742	81685	81685	Daphne	1622	“ Oh , I get it . He ’s rich , is n’t he ? ”
81777	81787	81775	81775	they	1075	“ You are leaving , Daphne . Right now . ”
81804	81818	81798	81798	Audrey	26	“ Tell everyone you ’re sorry and I wo n’t call your manager . ”
81819	81827	81828	81828	Daphne	1622	“ Gee , I ’m sorry everyone , ”
81839	81867	81828	81828	Daphne	1622	“ Sorry my sister is being such a lame piece of shit . Gretchen was always the fun , slutty one . Guess Audrey made her boring . ”
81946	81957	81940	81940	Daphne	1622	“ All right , all right . I ’m going . ”
81967	81993	81958	81958	She	1622	“ If you needed money , sis , all you had to do was ask . No need to whore yourself out to fugly guys . ”
81994	81999	81940	81940	Daphne	1622	“ Get . Out . ”
82000	82007	82008	82008	Cade	36	“ Can I be of assistance ? ”
82025	82032	82019	82019	Daphne	1622	“ Cade . You remembered me . ”
82048	82058	82059	82059	Cade	36	“ It ’s going to be okay , Daphne , ”
82075	82083	82084	82084	He	36	“ I ’ll take care of you . ”
82162	82187	82145	82145	Eldon	61	“ I never liked you much , Ms. Petty , but I never thought you were deliberately cruel . I see I was wrong . ”
82188	82194	82195	82195	Gretchen	503	“ You ’re still wrong , ”
82210	82221	82195	82195	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m not dating Hunter because he ’s rich . ”
82232	82243	82244	82244	he	61	“ I am returning to the party to serve dinner , ”
82392	82401	82383	82383	She	53	“ Hey , kiddo . Can we talk ? ”
82402	82406	82407	82407	Gretchen	503	“ Right now ? ”
82417	82439	82407	82407	Gretchen	503	“ Let ’s go to the kitchen , then . I need to make sure the desserts are ready to serve . ”
82464	82469	82455	82455	Kat	53	“ This is impressive . ”
82470	82482	82485	82485	Hunter	29	“ There ’s three of them in the manor , actually . ”
82492	82503	82485	82485	Hunter	29	“ The entire house is lovely , is n’t it ? ”
82504	82508	82509	82509	Kat	53	“ I imagine . ”
82534	82540	82531	82531	her	53	“ So is that why ? ”
82576	82580	82564	82564	She	53	“ Why what ? ”
82581	82592	82564	82564	She	53	“ Why you ’re with you know who . Scarface . ”
82676	82690	82665	82665	She	53	“ I do n’t know where you ’re going with this , Kat . ”
82691	82730	82665	82665	She	53	“ I just wonder if you and him is about money more than lust . I mean , I get it . I like money , too , but jeez . He ’s a lot to take in . ”
82731	82736	82737	82737	Gretchen	503	“ You know me , ”
82741	82750	82737	82737	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll do anything for a paycheck . ”
82811	82824	82804	82804	she	53	“ I ca n’t believe you even had to ask me that . ”
82825	82840	82878	82878	She	53	“ I just have concerns for you . Do you need money that bad ? ”
82867	82877	82863	82863	Gretchen	503	“ Honey , I always need money . But — ”
82940	82947	82948	82948	Hunter	29	“ People are asking about you , ”
82960	82971	82948	82948	Hunter	29	“ I thought I ’d come and check on things . ”
82972	82978	82979	82979	Gretchen	503	“ We ’re coming back , ”
82983	82993	82994	82994	She	503	“ We were just making sure dessert was ready . ”
83033	83043	83022	83022	she	503	“ Shall we get back to our dinner guests ? ”
83044	83049	83050	83050	Hunter	29	“ If we must , ”
83278	83286	83287	83287	he	1069	“ It sounds like a fascinating project , ”
83290	83310	83287	83287	he	1069	“ I ca n’t wait to see the finished manuscript . When do you think you ’ll be done ? ”
83323	83359	83311	83311	Gretchen	503	“ I wanted to ask you about that . I ’ve had a bit of a setback and need a few more weeks to hit my deadline . Is that going to be a problem ? ”
83367	83381	83360	83360	He	1069	“ I ’ll run it past our boss and see what he says . ”
83393	83401	83387	83387	He	1069	“ Our ? What do you mean ? ”
83406	83419	83420	83420	He	1069	“ I ’m sure you can wrangle an extension out of him . ”
83427	83435	83420	83420	He	1069	“ Just do what you do best . ”
83444	83451	83436	83436	She	503	“ What are you talking about ? ”
83452	83464	83436	83436	She	503	“ Hunter ? It ’s obvious you ’re sleeping with him . ”
83465	83475	83436	83436	She	503	“ What does that have to do with anything ? ”
83486	83511	83481	83482	her editor	1104	“ Hunter ’s the owner of Bellefleur Publishing . It was his idea for this project , and he insisted you work on it . ”
83516	83521	83522	83522	She	503	“ I . . . ”
83853	83873	83843	83843	she	1622	“ Why does my editor think that if I ask you for an extension , I ’ll get one ? ”
83901	83919	83894	83894	He	29	“ He has a big mouth . It seems to be a trend with our dinner guests . ”
83920	83926	83927	83927	Gretchen	503	“ Daphne ’s not herself . ”
83953	83984	83951	83951	her	503	“ She ’s under a conservatorship because she ca n’t seem to stay out of drugs and alcohol . Audrey ’s spent half her life cleaning up Daphne ’s messes . ”
83985	83996	83997	83997	Hunter	29	“ I do n’t give a shit about your sister , ”
84001	84017	83997	83997	Hunter	29	“ Is that what you came in here to talk about ? I ’m busy . ”
84021	84043	84018	84018	She	503	“ You overheard me talking to Kat , did n’t you ? You ca n’t possibly think all that is true . ”
84044	84059	83951	83951	her	503	“ What part ’s not true ? You were n’t exactly refuting her claims . ”
84060	84085	84018	84018	She	503	“ I would never sleep with you just to get to your wallet . I ’m a little hurt that you think I would . ”
84086	84119	83951	83951	her	503	“ What am I supposed to think , Gretchen ? Your sister proclaims to our dinner party that you enjoy the company of men . Quite a few men , it seems . ”
84120	84135	84018	84018	She	503	“ So I was a little loose in my teenage years . So what ? ”
84136	84156	84157	84157	He	1110	“ And that you ’re sleeping with an ugly man for money . And you do n’t deny it . ”
84167	84198	84157	84157	He	1110	“ And I find you having the exact same conversation with your agent , and again , you do n’t deny it . Exactly what am I supposed to think ? ”
84199	84210	84211	84211	Gretchen	503	“ Well , for starters , you can trust me , ”
84235	84249	84250	84250	She	503	“ You really think I ’m sleeping with you because you ’re rich ? ”
84254	84267	84268	84268	Hunter	29	“ I ’m trying to think of another reason why you would , ”
84275	84310	84268	84268	Hunter	29	“ After all , it is acknowledged that I ’m quite ugly . And looking back , you came on to me . So yes , it ’s looking rather suspicious in my mind . ”
84311	84317	84318	84318	she	503	“ Your feelings are hurt , ”
84325	84335	84318	84318	she	503	“ And you ’re taking it out on me . ”
84341	84357	84336	84336	He	1110	“ You ’re not the person I thought you were . That much is clear . ”
84358	84399	84400	84400	She	503	“ And who did you think I was ? I ’ve never lied about my family or my finances . You never asked . Why do you think I work all the time at a job that makes me miserable ? ”
84403	84412	84400	84400	She	503	“ It ’s not my stunning work ethic . ”
84417	84480	84413	84413	He	1110	“ And for the record , I came on to you because I wanted you . Because I was drawn to you . You seemed lonely and ached to have someone touch you . And I guess I ’m stupid , because I wanted to touch you and rock your world . I guess that was a bad call on my part . ”
84481	84487	84526	84526	she	503	“ I guess it was . ”
84568	84579	84560	84560	Gretchen	503	“ I ’m sorry if my friends hurt your feelings — ”
84580	84620	84560	84560	Gretchen	503	“ They did n’t hurt my feelings . They simply showed me the truth of who you are . I should have known you were too good to be true . All those words you said , just words . ”
84625	84629	84621	84621	She	503	“ What words ? ”
84630	84671	84560	84560	Gretchen	503	“ Your talk of not caring what a man looked like as long as he made you happy . It turns out that you do n’t care what a man looks like as long as he has a full wallet . ”
84672	84701	84621	84621	She	503	“ That ’s a lie and you know it . And what are you talking about ? When did I ever say anything about men and their looks ? ”
84732	84760	84710	84710	She	503	“ Ask Brontë . Remember ? You told her that rich men thought they were the heroes of the fairy tale but they were truly the villains . ”
84819	84826	84827	84827	she	503	“ You were spying on me , ”
84831	84838	84827	84827	she	503	“ That day at the house . ”
84863	84890	84891	84891	He	1116	“ It ’s true , is n’t it ? You saw me that day . How ? And what does that have to do with anything ? ”
84935	84968	84926	84926	she	503	“ I do n’t understand what that has to do with anything . We did n’t know each other then . I did n’t meet you until I moved into this house . ”
85009	85051	85006	85006	She	503	“ And you own a new publisher that contacted my agent out of the blue and offered a big paycheck as long as I lived on location . At your house . You set this all up , did n’t you ? ”
85121	85142	85117	85117	She	503	“ I did n’t become a bestseller , did I ? Not really ? Did you buy all those books ? ”
85143	85160	85117	85117	She	503	“ I wanted to do something nice for you . It seems I am a fool . ”
85166	85192	85194	85194	he	29	“ You set this all up to bring me here . There ’s no new publisher . The letters . . . are those fakes ? ”
85208	85260	85204	85204	She	503	“ No wonder the details never matched the house . It ’s not this house , is it ? None of it ’s real . You basically paid me to come and live at your house for a month so I ’d be around you and fall in love with you ? ”
85275	85304	85261	85261	His	29	“ Do n’t try and throw love into this now , Gretchen . We ’re both not fools enough to believe you ’re really in love with me . ”
85320	85329	85330	85330	she	503	“ I ca n’t believe you did this , ”
85334	85355	85330	85330	she	503	“ I ca n’t believe you went to such levels just to try and get me to sleep with you . ”
85356	85363	85364	85364	he	29	“ It ’s not like that , ”
85367	85379	85380	85380	Gretchen	503	“ Is n’t it ? Is n’t that what you did ? ”
85409	85462	85400	85400	she	503	“ Is n’t all this and me being here because you wanted to fuck me ? Do n’t you care that you ’re ruining my life ? You ca n’t just play with people ’s livelihoods because you ’re bored and lonely , Hunter Buchanan . Reality does n’t work that way . ”
85463	85480	85400	85400	she	503	“ Does n’t it ? You certainly came running the moment you heard the dollar amount . ”
85487	85503	85481	85481	She	503	“ You really do think that of me . After all we ’ve been through . ”
85504	85544	85400	85400	she	503	“ What am I supposed to believe , Gretchen ? That you saw my face and thought you needed to have a man like me ? You ’ll forgive me if I do n’t quite fall for that again . ”
85589	85602	85603	85603	she	503	“ Well , thank you for making me feel like a whore , ”
85617	85656	85657	85657	She	503	“ It ’s good to know where I really stand with you . I thought I cared for you and that you cared for me , but I guess I was mistaken in that , was n’t I ? ”
85661	85677	85657	85657	She	503	“ I guess we ’re both in love with a person who did n’t exist . ”
85830	85839	85840	85840	she	503	“ We ’re going home tomorrow , Igor , ”
85844	85850	85840	85840	she	503	“ We ’re done here . ”
85891	85931	85879	85879	She	503	“ I wonder if it was even you that knocked over that glass of water , Igor . I ’m starting to think Hunter tramples on anyone just to get what he wants . No wonder he ’s alone . ”
86461	86467	86468	86468	She	503	“ Where are you going ? ”
86513	86526	86507	86507	she	503	“ I ’m leaving . I just need to call a cab . ”
86538	86550	86527	86527	He	29	“ You have n’t finished the project you were hired for . ”
86551	86556	86557	86557	she	503	“ It was delayed , ”
86564	86583	86557	86557	she	503	“ Though I ’m guessing the delay was just as manufactured as the project , was n’t it ? ”
86597	86604	86590	86590	She	503	“ Good - bye , Hunter . ”
86605	86608	86609	86609	He	29	“ Wait . ”
86620	86632	86609	86609	He	29	“ You need to hear what I ’m going to say . ”
86649	86654	86641	86641	she	503	“ What is it ? ”
86672	86726	86655	86655	Hunter	29	“ I ’ve decided that I do n’t care that you only want me for my money . I have more than enough of it . If you stay with me , I ’ll continue to pay your bills as long as you continue to provide companionship . . . at all levels . ”
86742	86754	86737	86737	she	503	“ You said you loved me just a few days ago . ”
86755	86785	86655	86655	Hunter	29	“ What I feel for you has no bearing on a business arrangement . I want your body . I want what we had before . Name your price . ”
86795	86803	86786	86786	Gretchen	503	“ You ’re killing me , Hunter . ”
86804	86808	86737	86737	she	503	“ One million . ”
86813	86825	86809	86809	Her	503	“ Fuck you . You ca n’t buy me like that . ”
86826	86829	86830	86830	His	1138	“ No ? ”
86838	86879	86830	86830	His	1138	“ You do n’t approve of the direct route ? Very well , then . I ’ll speak with Preston Stewart and see about contracting another on - site project for you . I ’m sure we can arrange something . ”
86886	86894	86895	86895	she	503	“ I ache for you , Hunter , ”
86902	86953	86895	86895	she	503	“ That you think such awful things of me , and that you ’re so lonely that you ’re still willing to have someone at your side despite thinking they loathe you . That they ’re turned off by your face . You deserve to have someone who loves you . ”
86962	86975	86895	86895	she	503	“ I wish you nothing but the best . I really do . ”
86989	86993	86976	86976	She	503	“ Two million . ”
86999	87039	86994	86994	She	503	“ Someday you ’re going to learn that money ca n’t buy everything , Hunter . You ca n’t manipulate people just because you have a bigger wallet . It ’s going to make you very , very lonely . ”
87040	87044	87045	87045	he	1139	“ Three million , ”
87049	87056	86994	86994	She	503	“ Good - bye , Hunter . ”
87196	87205	87182	87182	Audrey	26	“ Logan Hawkings ’s office , Audrey speaking . ”
87206	87213	87220	87221	Brontë Dawson	172	“ Hey , it ’s me . ”
87232	87249	87220	87221	Brontë Dawson	172	“ I need to talk to Logan , but I ’m glad I got you first . ”
87250	87253	87182	87182	Audrey	26	“ Oh ? ”
87254	87267	87268	87268	Brontë	172	“ I wanted to see how things were going with your sister , ”
87271	87277	87268	87268	Brontë	172	“ How is she doing ? ”
87353	87359	87360	87360	Audrey	26	“ She ’s a mess , ”
87367	87373	87360	87360	Audrey	26	“ Nothing new about that . ”
87374	87391	87360	87360	Audrey	26	“ Oh , no . Poor Gretchen . She must be taking this breakup so hard . ”
87404	87407	87396	87396	Audrey	26	“ Gretchen ? ”
87408	87414	87360	87360	Audrey	26	“ Yes . Your sister ? ”
87415	87418	87396	87396	Audrey	26	“ Oh . ”
87478	87486	87487	87487	Audrey	26	“ Gretchen ’s having a tough time , ”
87490	87502	87487	87487	Audrey	26	“ She lost her apartment so she ’s staying with me . ”
87503	87509	87473	87473	Daphne	1622	“ Does she need money ? ”
87510	87547	87548	87548	Audrey	26	“ Money ’s not a problem . Daph has money . Gretchen could ask me for money . She would n’t take it , though . And money seems to be the least of her problems . ”
87557	87570	87548	87548	Audrey	26	“ She just sits on my couch and cries all day long . ”
87571	87586	87473	87473	Daphne	1622	“ Cries ? Gretchen ? Really ? She seems so . . . strong . ”
87587	87596	87597	87597	Audrey	26	“ Well , not when she ’s dumped , ”
87617	87680	87597	87597	Audrey	26	“ She has n’t moved from my sofa in two days . She just keeps watching bad movies and reading my books and weeping . I came home yesterday to find her sobbing her brains out at Phantom of the Opera . She kept going on and on about how Christine was a bitch because the Phantom needed her love and support . ”
87681	87690	87597	87597	Audrey	26	“ Oh , jeez . That ’s awkward . ”
87691	87697	87597	87597	Audrey	26	“ You ’re telling me . ”
87698	87721	87722	87722	Brontë	172	“ You know , I never thought Hunter would hook up with Gretchen . He just seems so . . . remote . ”
87726	87734	87722	87722	Brontë	172	“ I wish I could help her . ”
87735	87748	87597	87597	Audrey	26	“ I can send her to your place for a few days . ”
87752	87764	87749	87749	Brontë	172	“ Somehow I do n’t think Logan wants to watch Phantom . ”
87835	87847	87828	87828	She	26	“ I ’m not quite sure what to do with her . ”
87848	87901	87828	87828	She	26	“ Well , it ’s obvious ! We have to get the two of them back together . Hunter ’s so lonely and Gretchen ’s so bold and clever . I think she ’s good for him . Logan said that he ’d never seen Hunter happier than when they were together . ”
87935	87950	87924	87924	their	1147	“ I ’m not good with match - making , Brontë . Fair warning . ”
87951	87969	87902	87902	Audrey	26	“ Me either . But we ’ll ask Logan to intercede . Hunter will listen to him . ”
87970	87979	87980	87980	Audrey	26	“ What ’s this ‘ we ’ stuff ? ”
87984	87997	87980	87980	Audrey	26	“ You ’re his fiancée . I ’m merely the hired help . ”
88002	88017	87998	87998	Brontë	172	“ Okay then , I ’ll handle it . Put me through to him . ”
88018	88026	88027	88027	Audrey	26	“ Just get her off my couch , ”
88429	88434	88415	88416	Preston Hunter	138	“ Preston Stewart speaking . ”
88435	88444	88415	88416	Preston Hunter	138	“ Why do we need a new ghostwriter ? ”
88445	88472	88415	88416	Preston Hunter	138	“ Ah . Mr. Buchanan . Very nice to talk to you again . I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed the party the — ”
88473	88478	88479	88479	Hunter	29	“ Explain to me , ”
88490	88498	88479	88479	Hunter	29	“ why we need a new ghostwriter . ”
88499	88502	88503	88503	Preston	104	“ Well , ”
88506	88551	88503	88503	Preston	104	“ I got a call from Ms. Petty ’s agent earlier today . She ’s off the project . Since we have n’t signed anything , there ’s no money to collect as of yet . Kat and I were still working on negotiations — ”
88552	88564	88596	88596	she	503	“ What do you mean , she ’s off the project ? ”
88565	88579	88503	88503	Preston	104	“ I mean she quit . She does n’t want to do it . ”
88580	88588	88589	88589	Gretchen	503	“ Did you offer her more money ? ”
88602	88615	88598	88599	The editor	1104	“ Mr. Buchanan , that ’s not how publishing works . I — ”
88788	88791	88779	88779	Hunter	29	“ Eldon ? ”
88792	88798	88799	88800	The assistant	1054	“ Yes , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
88811	88823	88799	88800	The assistant	1054	“ Bring the car around . I need to go out . ”
88864	88868	88861	88861	Eldon	61	“ Of course . ”
88929	88933	88934	88934	Hunter	29	“ Wait here , ”
88960	88967	88951	88951	Eldon	61	“ I ’ll be back shortly . ”
89226	89245	89246	89246	He	29	“ I ’ve had something come up . Someone send me the meeting notes when you ’re done . ”
89266	89272	89264	89264	Hunter	29	“ Do n’t you knock ? ”
89273	89278	89285	89285	him	29	“ Where ’s Audrey ? ”
89331	89352	89353	89353	Logan	25	“ Probably getting my lunch from the cafe downstairs . Calm the fuck down . What ’s wrong with you ? ”
89358	89365	89366	89366	Hunter	29	“ I need to find Gretchen . ”
89396	89405	89426	89426	Logan	25	“ So you admit that you fucked up ? ”
89413	89425	89406	89406	He	25	“ What are you talking about ? What do you know ? ”
89451	89462	89442	89442	his	25	“ I know that Brontë ’s been talking to Gretchen . ”
89463	89466	89426	89426	Logan	25	“ And ? ”
89467	89470	89471	89471	Logan	25	“ And , ”
89474	89495	89471	89471	Logan	25	“ she says she ’s really upset . Cries a lot . You fucked it up , did n’t you ? ”
89523	89529	89509	89509	Hunter	29	“ What did she say ? ”
89530	89539	89496	89496	He	29	“ First you tell me what you did . ”
89554	89564	89540	89540	Hunter	29	“ She found out the project was a sham . ”
89565	89594	89509	89509	Hunter	29	“ And that made her cry ? Damn , she ’s a sensitive type , is n’t she ? I would n’t have pictured her as the type — ”
89595	89607	89540	89540	Hunter	29	“ Then I accused her of sleeping with me for money . ”
89608	89611	89509	89509	Hunter	29	“ Ah . ”
89612	89649	89540	89540	Hunter	29	“ And then when she was packing , I told her that I did n’t care if she loved me or not . I ’d pay her to use her body regardless of how she felt . ”
89666	89672	89540	89540	Hunter	29	“ She turned it down . ”
89676	89687	89673	89673	Logan	25	“ Yeah . I ’d say you fucked it up . ”
89688	89691	89692	89692	Hunter	29	“ Shit . ”
89697	89715	89692	89692	Hunter	29	“ I thought for sure that she was using me for my money . Her agent said — ”
89716	89725	89673	89673	Logan	25	“ Her agent thinks everything ’s about money , ”
89732	89741	89742	89742	Audrey	26	“ Or did n’t Gretchen tell you that ? ”
89768	89783	89763	89763	her	26	“ Or were you too busy calling her a whore and a money grubber ? ”
89784	89793	89794	89794	Logan	25	“ Audrey , this is not the place — ”
89797	89803	89804	89804	Audrey	26	“ The door was open , ”
89811	89823	89804	89804	Audrey	26	“ I ’m sorry . I overheard . I ’ll leave . ”
89824	89829	89830	89830	Hunter	29	“ No ! Stay . ”
89836	89851	89830	89830	Hunter	29	“ What makes you so sure she was n’t with me for my money ? ”
89861	89864	89865	89865	she	26	“ Because , ”
89869	89918	89865	89865	she	26	“ If she wanted to freeload off someone , she ’d freeload off Daphne , who has millions . Or Cooper , who ’s so in love with her that he ’d buy her whatever she wants . Why would she need to sleep with someone for that ? ”
89947	89966	89967	89967	Audrey	26	“ I suppose the better question is , what made you think Gretchen wanted you for your money ? ”
89970	89981	89967	89967	Audrey	26	“ Did she ever give you reason to think that ? ”
89982	89990	89991	89991	he	29	“ Every time she looked at me , ”
89994	90008	90009	90009	He	29	“ I ’m supposed to believe that she wants to be with this ? ”
90039	90048	90033	90033	Audrey	26	“ Why is that so hard to believe ? ”
90049	90056	90033	90033	Audrey	26	“ Because I ’m a monster . ”
90057	90064	90065	90065	Audrey	26	“ My sister ’s a romantic , ”
90069	90075	90065	90065	Audrey	26	“ Maybe she likes monsters . ”
90109	90124	90076	90076	He	29	“ Why ’d she turn down the writing project ? She needs the money . ”
90125	90135	90136	90136	Audrey	26	“ She does n’t need the money that bad , ”
90158	90173	90136	90136	Audrey	26	“ She ’d rather be broke than work on that project a moment longer . ”
90274	90282	90262	90262	he	29	“ How do I get her back ? ”
90283	90286	90287	90287	Logan	25	“ Groveling , ”
90291	90301	90287	90287	Logan	25	“ Take it from me . Lots of groveling . ”
90313	90319	90302	90302	Audrey	26	“ That ’s a start . ”
90337	90341	90346	90346	Cooper	328	“ You okay ? ”
90365	90368	90369	90369	She	503	“ Yeah . ”
90376	90383	90369	90369	She	503	“ It ’s just my book . ”
90384	90388	90358	90358	He	25	“ Sad ending ? ”
90389	90394	90395	90395	she	503	“ Something like that , ”
90767	90774	90775	90775	Cooper	328	“ You sure you ’re okay ? ”
90794	90802	90783	90783	He	29	“ I hate seeing you so unhappy . ”
90803	90810	90811	90811	she	503	“ I ’m fine , really , ”
90922	90925	90926	90926	Cooper	328	“ Gretchen , ”
90939	90948	90933	90933	She	503	“ Oh , Cooper , please do n’t — ”
90949	90953	90954	90954	he	1396	“ I know , ”
90958	90981	90954	90954	he	1396	“ I know . It ’s weird between us right now , is n’t it ? I should have never said anything . ”
90992	91020	90982	90982	He	1396	“ It ’s not that , Cooper . I just . . . wish we could go back to the way things were before , you know ? ”
91021	91035	90954	90954	he	1396	“ Before I gave you my heart and you stomped it to pieces ? ”
91045	91048	91036	91036	Gretchen	503	“ I — ”
91049	91054	91055	91055	he	1396	“ I ’m kidding , ”
91062	91150	91055	91055	he	1396	“ I ’ll be honest , I wish things could be different between you and me . But even what we had before was better than what we have now . I know you do n’t care for me the way I care for you . And that ’s fine , Gretchen . But it hurts me that we ca n’t even be friends anymore . I ’d rather we acknowledge the problem , move past it , and get back to being just Gretchen and Cooper . ”
91175	91183	91159	91159	she	1192	“ I ’m so sorry , Coop . ”
91184	91187	91188	91188	he	1193	“ Hey , ”
91192	91197	91188	91188	he	1193	“ Do n’t apologize . ”
91211	91229	91198	91198	He	1193	“ I ’m sorry I got all weird on you when you needed a friend the most . ”
91240	91255	91230	91230	She	1192	“ You ’re such a good friend . I ’m not normally this emotional . ”
91256	91260	91261	91261	he	1193	“ I know , ”
91293	91311	91312	91312	she	1192	“ I ’m glad that we ’re going to go back to just being Gretchen and Coop , ”
91318	91350	91312	91312	she	1192	“ And I ’m sorry I did n’t fall in love with you . If I could have picked to fall in love with someone , it would have been you . ”
91367	91420	91351	91351	He	1193	“ It ’s okay , Gretch . I know you ’re in love with Buchanan . It was obvious as soon as I saw him with you . You lit up around him in a way I ’ve never seen . I ’ve had a few weeks to get over you now . ”
91533	91536	91537	91537	Gretchen	503	“ Hunter , ”
91686	91689	91681	91681	She	503	“ Hunter ! ”
91698	91702	91703	91703	Gretchen	503	“ Hunter Buchanan . ”
91711	91730	91703	91703	Gretchen	503	“ Turn around , damn it , or I ’m going to run straight into all this traffic . ”
91762	91768	91747	91747	He	29	“ What do you want ? ”
91779	91786	91769	91769	She	503	“ You were bringing me flowers ? ”
91787	91792	91769	91769	She	503	“ I was not . ”
91793	91814	91769	91769	She	503	“ Really ? I suppose you just throw flowers into every garbage can outside of a coffee shop , then ? ”
91865	91871	91872	91872	he	29	“ I threw them away , ”
91879	91888	91872	91872	he	29	“ I noticed . You should n’t have . ”
91889	91910	91911	91911	His	29	“ Why not ? It ’s clear you ’ve moved on . Anything I say will fall on deaf ears . ”
91924	91931	91916	91916	She	503	“ Were you coming to apologize ? ”
91939	91968	91932	91932	He	29	“ Then why does it matter if I ’ve moved on ? You made it clear you just wanted my body . You think I ’m for sale . ”
91969	91980	91981	91981	He	29	“ I was wrong . I should have trusted you . ”
91996	92013	91932	91932	He	29	“ You should have . You should have believed that you ca n’t buy my affection . ”
92014	92025	92036	92036	he	29	“ What other choice does a man like me have ? ”
92147	92159	92143	92143	Her	503	“ You ’re not ugly , Hunter . Not to me . ”
92160	92174	92175	92175	he	29	“ You ’ll have to forgive me if I do n’t believe that , ”
92182	92200	92175	92175	he	29	“ I ’ve had a lifetime of being reassured that I ’m only wanted for my fortune . ”
92201	92223	92224	92224	Gretchen	503	“ Well , if you do n’t believe that , then I guess you do n’t have much faith in me , ”
92231	92246	92224	92224	Gretchen	503	“ And that hurts me that you think I ’m that shallow and mercenary . ”
92255	92261	92251	92251	he	29	“ I did n’t mean — ”
92262	92289	92290	92290	People	162	“ Did n’t you ? You ’re saying I ’m an awful person who will only fuck a man if he ’s got a fat wallet . ”
92333	92343	92327	92327	she	503	“ How do you think that makes me feel ? ”
92347	92366	92344	92344	He	29	“ Not bad enough , it seems . I see you ’ve already moved on to your friend . ”
92379	92429	92367	92367	Fury	142	“ Ugh ! Will you just listen to yourself for a moment ? You ’re so convinced that you ’re some sort of hideous beast that you think that someone ca n’t possibly see the true you inside . Yeah , well I saw the true you , buddy . ”
92464	92582	92456	92456	she	503	“ I saw a man who isolates himself because he ’s worried about making other people uncomfortable . I saw a man who does n’t leave his house very often , but makes sure that the staff is well paid . I saw a man who works all day tirelessly and tends to roses because he enjoys their beauty . I saw a man who expects perfection in himself but is okay with others treating him like dirt . I see a man who shuts out the world because he ’s so afraid of getting hurt again . And you tell me I ’m the one with the problem ? How about you look in the mirror ? ”
92592	92668	92669	92669	she	1209	“ How about you take a long , hard look at that asshole butler of yours ? How about you hire someone who you actually enjoy being around ? You ’re a wonderful person , Hunter . You ’re shy but you ’re incredibly giving and thoughtful , and you have a poetic soul under all that muscle . If you ’re lonely , it ’s because you ’ve isolated yourself . You have friends ! ”
92672	92704	92669	92669	she	1209	“ Your buddies thought you were happy at the dinner party and I saw their faces . They were happy for you . Why ca n’t you be happy for you ? ”
92759	92764	92765	92765	Gretchen	503	“ No , Hunter , ”
92769	92787	92765	92765	Gretchen	503	“ I care about you , I really do . But I ’m still mad at you . ”
92788	92836	92837	92837	He	1211	“ I want you with me , Gretchen . If you can forgive me for what I said , I want you at my side . I just have a hard time believing that someone as perfect as you would want to be with someone like me . ”
92885	92891	92892	92892	Hunter	29	“ Am I too late ? ”
92905	92918	92892	92892	Hunter	29	“ Is that it ? You ’ve moved on ? To him ? ”
92926	92949	92919	92919	Gretchen	503	“ I was sad and Cooper was comforting me . We ’re just friends . That ’s all we ’ll ever be . ”
92950	92955	92956	92956	His	1211	“ You were sad ? ”
92963	92966	92956	92956	His	1211	“ Why ? ”
92967	92973	92919	92919	Gretchen	503	“ Why do you think ? ”
92997	93005	92989	92989	she	503	“ I ’m still mad at you . ”
93006	93013	92919	92919	Gretchen	503	“ But you ’ll forgive me . ”
93014	93018	92989	92989	she	503	“ Not today . ”
93019	93024	93025	93025	His	1211	“ Tomorrow , then . ”
93031	93041	93042	93042	Gretchen	503	“ Maybe not tomorrow . I ’m still deciding , ”
93057	93068	93042	93042	Gretchen	503	“ You need to make some changes first , though . ”
93069	93073	93074	93074	he	1211	“ I will , ”
93077	93080	93081	93081	she	503	“ Good ! ”
93087	93099	93081	93081	she	503	“ And next time , do n’t throw away my roses ! ”
93335	93348	93325	93325	Cooper	328	“ Thank God you ’re here . Did you see this mess ? ”
93349	93352	93353	93353	she	503	“ Mess ? ”
93357	93364	93353	93353	she	503	“ I think they ’re beautiful . ”
93365	93397	93325	93325	Cooper	328	“ The first delivery showed up a few hours ago , and they ’ve been coming in all morning . I think someone bought every purple rose in the entire city . ”
93398	93401	93402	93402	she	503	“ Blue , ”
93422	93427	93402	93402	she	503	“ They ’re blue . ”
93428	93459	93460	93460	He	1215	“ Well , there ’s no name for the recipient . No sender . Just flowers coming in from every single florist in all of Manhattan . It ’s crazy . ”
93482	93489	93464	93464	Gretchen	503	“ I think it ’s sweet . ”
93490	93503	93402	93402	she	503	“ I do n’t know what to do with all of them . ”
93504	93511	93512	93512	she	503	“ Give them out to customers , ”
93964	93967	93968	93968	Cooper	328	“ Well , ”
93986	93996	93971	93971	she	53	“ We finally got a note with the roses . ”
93997	94001	94002	94002	Gretchen	503	“ We did ? ”
94013	94018	94002	94002	Gretchen	503	“ Where is it ? ”
94024	94034	94019	94019	Cooper	328	“ How ’d you know it was for you ? ”
94035	94049	94050	94050	She	503	“ Just a hunch . Now , where ’s my letter ? Gimme . ”
94129	94134	94135	94135	Cooper	328	“ What is that ? ”
94143	94147	94135	94135	Cooper	328	“ Looks old . ”
94148	94154	94155	94155	Gretchen	503	“ It ’s a letter , ”
94162	94169	94155	94155	Gretchen	503	“ And it ’s very old . ”
94187	94195	94155	94155	Gretchen	503	“ I need a moment in private . ”
94196	94199	94200	94200	Cooper	328	“ Sure , ”
94724	94733	94708	94708	she	503	“ I have to run out , Cooper . ”
94747	94752	94734	94734	He	1236	“ You coming back ? ”
94753	94764	94765	94765	she	503	“ I am . I just need to see something , ”
95194	95202	95203	95204	the receptionist	1170	“ Well , hi there , ma’am , ”
95284	95306	95278	95278	She	503	“ Do n’t just stand in the hall like you done lost your britches . We do n’t bite in here ! ”
95329	95334	95335	95335	Gretchen	503	“ Um , hi . ”
95346	95357	95335	95335	Gretchen	503	“ I was just , uh , looking for someone . ”
95358	95365	95366	95367	the girl	503	“ Well , I ’m someone , ”
95370	95378	95366	95367	the girl	503	“ Can I help you find something ? ”
95385	95392	95379	95379	She	503	“ Is this the Buchanan office ? ”
95393	95398	95399	95400	the girl	503	“ It surely is , ”
95403	95426	95427	95427	she	503	“ My name ’s Maylee — that ’s all one word , not two . It ’s after my Nana and Pepaw , ”
95443	95458	95427	95427	she	503	“ I ’m Mr. Buchanan ’s secretary . It ’s nice to meet you . ”
95459	95482	95399	95400	the girl	503	“ Nice to meet you , too . I ’m sorry , I ’m just . . . is Mr. Buchanan here ? ”
95483	95497	95498	95498	She	503	“ Naw . He went to lunch with some fancy - looking guys . ”
95517	95531	95498	95498	She	503	“ Gimme your name again and I ’ll tell him you stopped by . ”
95532	95539	95399	95400	the girl	503	“ It ’s Gretchen . I — ”
95540	95546	95547	95547	Maylee	146	“ Oh , my lordamercy ! ”
95555	95581	95547	95547	Maylee	146	“ Mr. Hunter ’s your beau , ai n’t he ? Oh , my gosh . You are so pretty ! Of course you are . ”
95657	95671	95672	95672	Maylee	146	“ Mr. Hunter ’s gon na be so dang sad he missed you , ”
95698	95744	95682	95682	She	146	“ He makes me call all the flower shops in the city lookin ’ for your flowers , you know . Man ’s lost his cotton - pickin ’ mind over you , if you do n’t mind saying so . It ’s really cute . ”
95769	95780	95762	95762	She	146	“ Do you know what time he ’ll be back ? ”
95781	95785	95786	95786	Maylee	146	“ No ma’am , ”
95789	95810	95786	95786	Maylee	146	“ But if you ’ll give me your number , I ’ll give you a holler when he gets back . ”
95811	95816	95817	95817	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s okay , ”
95828	95835	95817	95817	Gretchen	503	“ I ’ll swing by tomorrow . ”
95836	95846	95847	95847	Maylee	146	“ I ’ll be sure and tell Mr. Hunter , ”
95860	95869	95851	95851	Gretchen	503	“ Y’all have a nice day , now . ”
96227	96236	96237	96237	Maylee	146	“ Well , hi there , Ms. Gretchen , ”
96267	96282	96243	96243	she	146	“ You caught Mr. Hunter in the office today . Ai n’t that somethin’ ? ”
96283	96288	96289	96289	Gretchen	503	“ It sure is , ”
96303	96311	96294	96294	She	503	“ Mind if I go on in ? ”
96312	96323	96324	96324	Maylee	146	“ ’ Course not . Lemme just ring Mr. Hunter . ”
96330	96337	96338	96338	Gretchen	503	“ He saw me come in , ”
96341	96364	96365	96365	She	503	“ I know , but I ’m s’posed to ring everyone , Ms. Gretchen . Mr. Hunter says it ’s the rules . ”
96375	96387	96365	96365	She	503	“ Mr. Hunter ? Ms. Gretchen ’s here to see you . ”
96395	96402	96365	96365	She	503	“ You can go in now . ”
96403	96407	96409	96409	Gretchen	503	“ Thank you , ”
96457	96462	96444	96444	He	148	“ Hello , Gretchen . ”
96471	96482	96463	96463	She	503	“ Where exactly did you find that secretary of yours ? ”
96486	96493	96483	96483	He	148	“ It ’s a long story . ”
96503	96508	96483	96483	He	148	“ You look gorgeous . ”
96581	96592	96593	96593	Her	503	“ I thought I ’d come by and say hi . ”
96627	96631	96617	96617	He	148	“ Please sit . ”
96660	96674	96683	96683	She	503	“ I wanted to come by and say thank you for the roses . ”
96745	96758	96741	96741	Gretchen	503	“ Nice office . I did n’t know you had one here . ”
96759	96767	96727	96727	she	503	“ I did n’t until last week . ”
96775	96785	96768	96768	She	503	“ What made you decide that you needed one ? ”
96786	96791	96792	96792	he	148	“ You were right , ”
96796	96908	96792	96792	he	148	“ I ’ve been hiding away from the world for a long time . I told you about my accident . Things were n’t easy for me after that . It became easier to hide from the world than to go out into it . When I . . . returned to my father ’s house after the hospital , he hired private tutors for me and I hid from the world . He ’d insisted I go to college , though . I tried to get out of it , but he refused . It was like living in a waking nightmare . Being amongst all those strangers . . . ”
96921	96940	96916	96916	he	1273	“ College was n’t easy for me . If it were n’t for the friendship of . . . ”
96955	97007	97008	97008	He	1273	“ Logan and the others , I would have never made it through . I was picked on and women flinched at the sight of me . When I inherited my father ’s business , I set up in my house and it was just easier not to leave unless necessary . ”
97011	97040	97008	97008	He	1273	“ It became easier to avoid the world than to live in it . . . until I met you . You ’re why I bought this place . ”
97046	97069	97041	97041	Gretchen	503	“ So I made you buy real estate ? That ’s a pretty good super - power , I have to admit . ”
97078	97094	97070	97070	His	1273	“ I already owned this office . I just decided to keep it for myself . ”
97108	97124	97070	97070	His	1273	“ It reminds me to be out there in life , instead of hiding away . ”
97125	97133	97134	97134	she	503	“ I ’m very proud of you , ”
97138	97165	97134	97134	she	503	“ And I hope that you someday realize that you ’re not this monster you ’ve painted yourself to be . You ’re just a man . ”
97180	97190	97191	97191	Hunter	148	“ I took your advice about Eldon , too . ”
97238	97244	97234	97234	she	503	“ He ’s very loyal — ”
97245	97253	97254	97254	Hunter	148	“ He ’s a cranky old bastard , ”
97257	97322	97254	97254	Hunter	148	“ But yes , he ’s very loyal . He ’s also elderly and has family in the west . I gave him a very large retirement bonus as thanks for his tireless work , and I suggested he visit his daughters for a time . And I hired some additional staff at Buchanan Manor . It ’s rather . . . quiet lately . ”
97333	97352	97323	97323	She	503	“ Maylee ’s not exactly what I had in mind when I suggested you hire a new assistant . ”
97361	97370	97358	97358	he	1277	“ Maylee is a . . . problem . ”
97371	97379	97323	97323	She	503	“ She seems like a sweet girl . ”
97380	97386	97387	97387	Hunter	148	“ That is the problem . ”
97397	97420	97421	97421	he	1277	“ When I had Eldon call the agency , I told them to find me someone pleasant . She ’s very pleasant , ”
97428	97453	97421	97421	he	1277	“ But I feel I should have been more specific . She ’s not good with computers . Or phones . Or the copier . ”
97470	97506	97460	97460	He	1277	“ Yesterday , she set up a meeting for a client and then did n’t tell me about it because she could n’t find her sticky note . I was extremely . . . annoyed . ”
97507	97517	97460	97460	He	1277	“ Oh , no . What did you do ? ”
97518	97536	97460	97460	He	1277	“ I suggested she use the computer to keep my schedule instead of Post - it notes . ”
97552	97559	97537	97537	Gretchen	503	“ And what did she say ? ”
97560	97563	97564	97564	he	1277	“ Nothing , ”
97571	97575	97564	97564	he	1277	“ She cried . ”
97576	97582	97537	97537	Gretchen	503	“ What did you do ? ”
97583	97596	97564	97564	he	1277	“ What else could I do ? I gave her a raise . ”
97602	97605	97597	97597	Gretchen	503	“ Really ? ”
97610	97652	97606	97606	He	1277	“ This is her first job since leaving Arkansas and no one else will hire her because she is a hick , as she likes to tell me . I ca n’t fire the poor girl simply because she ’s unorganized . ”
97653	97658	97659	97659	Gretchen	503	“ You big softy , ”
97668	97679	97659	97659	Gretchen	503	“ Maybe you should hire an assistant for your assistant . ”
97680	97684	97685	97685	His	1277	“ Maybe so . ”
97694	97699	97685	97685	His	1277	“ You look beautiful . ”
97742	97746	97747	97747	Hunter	148	“ Forgive me , ”
97754	97770	97747	97747	Hunter	148	“ I ’m not trying to make you uncomfortable . Did you see my invitation ? ”
97778	97793	97771	97771	She	503	“ I have n’t been by work yet . You sent me an invitation ? ”
97799	97825	97794	97794	His	148	“ Today ’s flowers came with an invitation to a charity fundraiser scheduled for this weekend . A ball . It ’s at Buchanan Manor . ”
97839	97862	97830	97830	she	503	“ You ’re hosting a charity ball ? Are you serious ? Who are you and what have you done with Hunter ? ”
97870	97903	97863	97863	Hunter	148	“ I was approached because the venue that the charity ball had originally been scheduled for cancelled on them . They were desperate . It seemed like the polite thing to do . ”
97913	97919	97904	97904	Polite	153	“ What should I wear ? ”
97927	97939	97920	97920	His	148	“ Something formal . I ’m told there will be dancing . ”
97940	97949	97976	97976	she	503	“ Do you plan on dancing with me ? ”
97950	97958	97920	97920	His	148	“ If you ’ll be my date . ”
97959	97975	97976	97976	she	503	“ Oh , you just want me to be your date because I put out , ”
97996	98006	97990	97990	he	148	“ I ’m sorry you think that of me . ”
98047	98057	98058	98058	he	148	“ The invitation is yours if you want it , ”
98066	98083	98058	98058	he	148	“ Feel free to decline with no obligations . It was meant as a friendly gesture . ”
98111	98118	98119	98119	she	503	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
98481	98495	98496	98496	She	277	“ Would you like a hors d’oeuvres — oh , Gretchen ! Hello ! ”
98502	98509	98510	98510	Gretchen	503	“ Brandy , how are you ? ”
98550	98553	98554	98554	she	503	“ Busy , ”
98568	98587	98554	98554	she	503	“ But happy . There ’s been lots of changes in this house in the last two weeks . ”
98588	98596	98597	98597	She	503	“ Oh ? What kind of changes ? ”
98632	98649	98554	98554	she	503	“ Well , first of all , he got rid of that nasty assistant of his . ”
98653	98658	98650	98650	Gretchen	503	“ So I heard . ”
98659	98686	98650	98650	Gretchen	503	“ Yup . From what I hear , he ’s got three assistants now . Two localized here in the house and one at the office . ”
98687	98697	98650	98650	Gretchen	503	“ Three . That seems like a big change . ”
98698	98724	98725	98725	She	503	“ It is . And that ’s not all . That man of yours hired more staff and gave the rest of us a raise . ”
98730	98739	98725	98725	She	503	“ I got a Christmas bonus , too . ”
98740	98745	98746	98746	Gretchen	503	“ That ’s wonderful , ”
98752	98766	98746	98746	Gretchen	503	“ But I do n’t know that he ’s my man . I — ”
98786	98793	98768	98768	Brandy	154	“ Hi there . Hors d’oeuvres ? ”
99380	99390	99370	99370	he	29	“ Gretchen . You look . . . lovely . ”
99405	99410	99411	99411	She	503	“ Hi , Hunter . ”
99463	99470	99447	99451	A tall , slinky woman	1305	“ I seem to be underdressed . ”
99471	99476	99477	99477	Hunter	29	“ On the contrary , ”
99480	99505	99477	99477	Hunter	29	“ You ’re the most gorgeous thing in this room . You do n’t need flash to improve your beauty . Just your smile . ”
99514	99518	99506	99506	She	1305	“ You flirt . ”
99524	99528	99529	99529	she	1305	“ Nice party , ”
99548	99553	99519	99519	He	29	“ You did well . ”
99554	99561	99562	99562	he	29	“ I did it for you , ”
99581	99587	99577	99577	She	1305	“ You did , huh ? ”
99588	99615	99635	99638	someone in the crowd	1308	“ All for you . Everything . I want to prove to you that . . . I can be who you need me to be . ”
99621	99631	99616	99616	She	1305	“ Hunter , all I ’ve ever needed was — ”
99643	99651	99632	99632	She	1305	“ Maybe this is a bad time . ”
99652	99658	99659	99659	he	1308	“ Not a bad time , ”
99684	99689	99668	99668	he	1308	“ Come with me . ”
99853	99858	99859	99859	he	29	“ You ’re well ? ”
99878	99883	99884	99884	she	1305	“ Actually , no , ”
99901	99932	99898	99898	she	1305	“ There ’s this guy who kind of broke my heart . He lied to me and sabotaged my work just so I could stay around him a bit longer . ”
99950	99973	99974	99974	He	29	“ And would you have gone out with me ? Not knowing me ? Not knowing who I was except for this ? ”
99984	100002	99974	99974	He	29	“ How am I supposed to believe that ? People turn away at the sight of me . ”
100011	100030	100003	100003	His	29	“ Oh , Hunter . Just because most people are shallow assholes does n’t mean that I am . ”
100031	100039	99974	99974	He	29	“ But how would I know this ? ”
100040	100049	100050	100050	she	1305	“ It does n’t matter , does it ? ”
100054	100091	100050	100050	she	1305	“ We ’ll never know that , because you manipulated the situation and lied to me . You messed with my career . You ca n’t just make up jobs to bring people into your life . ”
100092	100103	100104	100104	he	29	“ You can still have the money , you know , ”
100109	100124	100104	100104	he	29	“ I never meant to force you to choose between your happiness and me . ”
100134	100179	100125	100125	She	1305	“ It ’s not about the money , Hunter . When will you get that ? It ’s about you and me and trust . How can I trust that you ’re not pulling strings behind the scenes again anytime something goes my way ? ”
100180	100200	100208	100208	his	29	“ How can I trust that you truly want me for who I am and not what I am ? ”
100211	100224	100225	100225	She	1305	“ Oh , Hunter . You have to have faith in me . ”
100258	100274	100250	100250	his	29	“ I love you so much , Gretchen . Please do n’t leave me again . ”
100275	100280	100241	100241	He	29	“ Then trust me . ”
100285	100294	100281	100281	His	29	“ It ’s hard for me to trust . ”
100302	100327	100299	100299	her	1318	“ I get that you ’re damaged , but how do you think I feel knowing you ’ve been manipulating things since day one ? ”
100340	100348	100328	100328	He	29	“ I never meant to hurt you . ”
100349	100362	100363	100363	Her	1318	“ I know . And that ’s why I ’ve come back . ”
100380	100401	100363	100363	Her	1318	“ It was the only way you knew how to reach out to me . I forgive you for that . ”
100413	100429	100430	100430	she	1318	“ I still have n’t forgiven you for the sabotage of my laptop , though , ”
100434	100441	100430	100430	she	1318	“ That was kind of low . ”
100442	100454	100455	100455	he	29	“ I did n’t realize Eldon was going to do that , ”
100459	100468	100455	100455	he	29	“ I just wanted him to delay you . ”
100469	100486	100455	100455	he	29	“ Oh , he delayed me all right . Killed my contract dead in the water . ”
100527	100544	100518	100518	she	1318	“ The files were recovered , by the way . I can send you the information . ”
100548	100624	100545	100545	She	1318	“ I ’m a lot happier without writing , honestly . It ’s not a profession I ’m very good at . The constant deadlines drive me crazy , and if I have to write one more astronaut story I just might jump off your balcony . Without the contracts , I ’m pretty broke but I ’m also a lot happier — and less stressed — than I ’ve been in a long time . ”
100625	100673	100693	100693	He	1318	“ Preston will be sorry to hear that . He contacted me the other day and suggested that if you did n’t want to do the epistolary novel that perhaps you ’d be interested in doing a cookbook . He loved your cooking at the dinner party . ”
100674	100680	100681	100681	She	1318	“ A cookbook , huh ? ”
100688	100692	100681	100681	She	1318	“ Your idea ? ”
100700	100721	100693	100693	He	1318	“ It was all him , I ’m afraid . For once , I had nothing to do with it . ”
100722	100729	100730	100730	she	1318	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
100775	100782	100763	100763	Gretchen	503	“ So what about the letters ? ”
100799	100809	100783	100783	He	1318	“ They were simply a means to an end . ”
100810	100827	100783	100783	He	1318	“ Were they real ? All those dirty , naughty things they wrote to each other ? ”
100828	100833	100834	100834	he	1318	“ They were real , ”
100838	100845	100834	100834	he	1318	“ Just not in this house . ”
100846	100888	100783	100783	He	1318	“ I ’m glad . I like to think that those two were crazy in love for so long and that they eventually get together . They do , do n’t they ? Get together and have a happy ever after ? ”
100892	100900	100889	100889	He	1318	“ I did n’t read far enough . ”
100909	100936	100901	100901	She	503	“ I like to think that they did . I feel like their story is ours , just a little . Two lovers separated and reunited . ”
100937	100944	100945	100945	he	1318	“ Their story ’s not ours , ”
100963	100978	100945	100945	he	1318	“ I want us to make our story , not follow someone else ’s . ”
101004	101013	100988	100988	she	503	“ You hurt me bad , you know . ”
101014	101029	101030	101030	His	1318	“ I ’m changing . For you , I ’ll change everything I am . ”
101038	101065	101030	101030	His	1318	“ I meant it , Gretchen . I love you . It does n’t matter to me if you love me or not . Just stay . ”
101066	101083	100988	100988	she	503	“ Well , it ’s a good thing for you that I love you , too . ”
101096	101102	101088	101088	He	1318	“ Do you mean it ? ”
101110	101139	101103	101103	She	503	“ We ’re going to have to get past this trust thing . Of course I mean it . Why would I lie to you after all this ? ”
101147	101158	101159	101159	His	1318	“ I just never thought I would be so lucky . ”
101214	101225	101226	101226	she	503	“ You want to see how lucky you can be ? ”
101231	101234	101226	101226	she	503	“ Always . ”
