6934	6982	6983	6983	He	302	“ It ’s called nervous laughter , you jackass . I laugh when I ’m uncomfortable . So sue me . And here ’s a thought : Since we ’re stuck in here together , how about you try not being such a jerk for five minutes ? ”
7183	7193	7194	7194	she	57	“ Should n’t someone come looking for you soon ? ”
7209	7215	7198	7198	they	298	“ You would think so . ”

7518	7537	7477	7477	she	112	“ Oh ? I guess you have special transportation to take you away before the hurricane gets here ? ”
7545	7549	7554	7554	he	281	“ A helicopter . ”
7560	7578	7554	7554	he	281	“ Okay , let ’s try this again . Do you think your helicopter is still there ? ”

7803	7830	7795	7795	She	309	“ I like to think that someone will come and check that the building ’s been completely evacuated before they all run off to the mainland . ”
7831	7834	7835	7835	His	310	“ Mmm . ”
7940	7943	7929	7929	She	57	“ Hello ? ”

8083	8107	8108	8108	His	312	“ Again , just a guess , but I would say that in the chaos of the evacuation , someone dropped the ball . ”
8286	8292	8267	8267	she	57	“ What are you doing ? ”
8303	8332	8294	8294	he	312	“ I ’m getting undressed . It ’s hot in here . Just stay over on your side of the elevator , and I wo n’t bother you . ”
8348	8352	8333	8333	She	57	“ Good idea . ”
8353	8369	8370	8370	she	57	“ Was that a compliment ? My . Am I forgiven for my insane giggling ? ”
8373	8377	8378	8378	His	312	“ Not yet . ”

8401	8414	8415	8415	He	316	“ Are you going to sit here and quote Plato all afternoon ? ”
8420	8440	8415	8415	He	316	“ That was Ausonius , actually . And yes . My philosophy degree has to be of some use . ”
8490	8502	8503	8503	she	57	“ You can get down to your boxers , you know , ”
8507	8520	8503	8503	she	57	“ I ca n’t see you , and it feels much better . ”
8521	8528	8503	8503	she	57	“ I do n’t think so . ”
8529	8534	8535	8535	she	57	“ Briefs , then ? ”
8541	8550	8553	8553	he	316	“ You struck me as a boxer man . ”
8595	8604	8605	8605	His	316	“ Why are you asking about my clothing ? ”
8615	8630	8612	8612	She	57	“ It ’s called making conversation . You should learn how to do it . ”
8662	8668	8653	8653	she	57	“ My name ’s Brontë . ”
8669	8677	8678	8678	Her	57	“ Brontë ? After Charlotte or Emily ? ”
8703	8727	8653	8653	she	57	“ Either . Both , I suppose . My mother had a fascination for classic literature , not that it got her anywhere . ”
8728	8740	8653	8653	she	57	“ I see we share a commonality in mothers , then . ”
8741	8753	8653	8653	she	57	“ Do we ? Was yours a total dreamer , too ? ”
8754	8760	8761	8761	he	316	“ Mine was a showgirl , ”
8765	8777	8761	8761	he	316	“ I am told she was highly impractical and extremely irresponsible . ”
8778	8783	8653	8653	she	57	“ Oh . Um . ”
8856	8895	8849	8849	She	57	“ I did n’t mean to sound negative about my mother . She just did n’t have sensible side . That ’s all . She was a good woman . Anyhow , she liked books — especially classics . ”
8896	8918	8806	8806	she	1526	“ And you have inherited her love , I take it . You seem to have an obsession with ancient philosophers . ”
8919	8925	8926	8926	she	57	“ Everyone has a hobby , ”
8930	8935	8806	8806	she	1526	“ What about you ? ”
8936	8941	8849	8849	She	57	“ I do not . ”
8942	8953	8849	8849	She	57	“ You do n’t have a hobby ? At all ? ”
8954	8985	8989	8989	she	57	“ I work . It takes up all my hours . Though I suppose I could spend my time memorizing pithy quotes to zing back at unsuspecting men in elevators . ”
8993	9005	8989	8989	she	57	“ I . . . wow . Sorry . I just — ”
9006	9012	9013	9013	he	320	“ I was teasing you , ”
9051	9054	9044	9044	she	57	“ Oh . ”
9060	9066	9056	9056	she	57	“ I did n’t realize . ”
9083	9091	9092	9092	He	320	“ So , what ’s your name ? ”
9106	9110	9092	9092	He	320	“ Logan Hawkings . ”
9111	9118	9130	9130	his	320	“ That ’s a nice name . ”
9119	9122	9130	9130	his	320	“ Indeed . ”
9136	9142	9130	9130	his	320	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
9143	9148	9130	9130	his	320	“ Nothing at all . ”
9189	9201	9173	9173	Brontë	112	“ So how long do you think we ’ll be here ? ”
9202	9230	9231	9231	She	112	“ I suppose it depends on how direct of a hit the hurricane makes on Seaturtle Cay . Then it depends on the organization of rescue efforts . ”
9242	9252	9253	9253	He	320	“ So far I ’m not impressed with them . ”
9256	9263	9253	9253	He	320	“ That makes two of us . ”
9292	9301	9275	9275	she	112	“ Do you have a family , Logan ? ”
9302	9305	9275	9275	she	112	“ No . ”
9324	9349	9317	9317	he	320	“ Me either . Since I ’m supposed to be on vacation , work wo n’t be missing me for a week at least . ”
9357	9372	9317	9317	he	320	“ God , I hope we ’re not stuck in here for a week . ”
9373	9380	9275	9275	she	112	“ I doubt that will happen . ”
9381	9386	9317	9317	he	320	“ Why is that ? ”
9387	9398	9399	9399	She	112	“ Because we ’ll die from dehydration long before that . ”
9413	9421	9399	9399	She	112	“ Do n’t say stuff like that . ”
9422	9435	9317	9317	he	320	“ All right then , we ’ll die thanks to the hurricane . ”
9436	9482	9275	9275	she	112	“ The glass is definitely half empty for you , is n’t it ? Do n’t think of things that way . Maybe one of the hotel employees stayed behind and will come looking for you . Did you assign anyone to check the floors ? ”
9483	9495	9496	9496	She	112	“ Assign anyone ? Why on earth would I do that ? ”
9502	9516	9496	9496	She	112	“ You ’re wearing a badge . Are n’t you the manager here ? ”
9517	9537	9538	9538	Lovely	72	“ Ah . . . yes . And no , I did n’t assign anyone to check the floors . ”
9606	9619	9602	9602	he	175	“ Since you ’re the manager , can I make a suggestion ? ”
9620	9627	9602	9602	he	175	“ I ca n’t stop you . ”
9628	9632	9602	9602	he	175	“ Thicker walls . ”
9633	9636	9602	9602	he	175	“ Pardon ? ”
9637	9658	9602	9602	he	175	“ You definitely want thicker walls . You can hear everything through some of them . I ’m just saying . ”
9659	9667	9668	9668	He	175	“ I ’ll keep that in mind . ”
9690	9695	9686	9686	She	112	“ What was that ? ”
9704	9710	9711	9711	he	175	“ Hurricane must be arriving , ”
9714	9719	9711	9711	he	175	“ Oh , shit . ”
9728	9739	9711	9711	he	175	“ We have to get out of here , Logan . ”
9740	9744	9745	9745	Brontë	112	“ I know . ”
9936	9944	9945	9945	She	57	“ I think we can jump down . ”
9990	9995	9962	9962	They	254	“ Is it safe ? ”
9996	10002	10003	10003	He	175	“ Safer than staying here . ”
10008	10016	10017	10017	Logan	175	“ So how do we do this ? ”
10036	10058	10027	10027	His	175	“ If you can hold the doors , I ’ll slide through and then look for something to brace them apart . ”
10080	10087	10068	10068	She	57	“ What if I go first ? ”
10088	10133	10134	10134	He	175	“ I ’m stronger . If I ca n’t find something to brace the doors , I ’ll have to hold them open for you while you climb down . I ’m not sure you ’ll be able to do the same for me . ”
10148	10156	10139	10139	Brontë	112	“ Okay . I ’ll hold them . ”
10223	10226	10227	10227	He	175	“ Ready ? ”
10242	10254	10227	10227	He	175	“ Would it bother you if I went between your legs ? ”
10255	10260	10261	10261	she	57	“ Oh , no , ”
10264	10276	10261	10261	she	57	“ Be my guest . My legs welcome your invading presence . ”
10286	10300	10301	10301	he	175	“ I just do n’t want you losing your grip on the door , ”
10305	10318	10301	10301	he	175	“ That ’s all . I promise I wo n’t look up . ”
10319	10327	10328	10328	she	57	“ Just get us out of here , ”
10464	10469	10453	10453	She	57	“ Are you okay ? ”
10470	10499	10504	10504	she	57	“ I ’m fine . Just off balance . Stay there , and I ’ll look for something to brace the door open so you can crawl out . ”
10500	10503	10504	10504	she	57	“ Okay , ”
10564	10567	10568	10568	she	57	“ Hurry ! ”
10687	10700	10701	10701	he	175	“ You ’re going to have to slide down between my arms , ”
10705	10716	10717	10717	She	57	“ Get on your stomach and lower your legs first . ”
10720	10729	10717	10717	She	57	“ Gotcha . Can I let go now ? ”
10730	10734	10735	10735	She	57	“ Let go . ”
10773	10781	10759	10759	she	57	“ Maybe I should get dressed first — ”
10782	10787	10759	10759	she	57	“ Just come on ! ”
10788	10796	10759	10759	she	57	“ Well , then close your eyes ! ”
10797	10828	10829	10829	She	57	“ I ’m not going to close my eyes , Brontë . Just come on already . I ca n’t hold this forever . The hurricane ’s almost on us . ”
10927	10931	10932	10932	he	338	“ Just drop , ”
10993	10997	10986	10986	they	339	“ You okay ? ”
11017	11022	10998	10998	Logan	175	“ You ’re bleeding . ”
11023	11041	11042	11042	She	57	“ Just a scratch . Something broke the skin when I slid . I ’ll be fine . ”
11065	11071	10998	10998	Logan	175	“ What about the hurricane ? ”
11072	11080	10998	10998	Logan	175	“ Sounds like it ’s getting worse . ”
11081	11091	10998	10998	Logan	175	“ Should we go to the basement ? Something ? ”
11092	11111	10998	10998	Logan	175	“ Not the basement . The front lobby ’s already flooding with water . We need someplace safe . ”
11116	11127	10998	10998	Logan	175	“ Someplace with no windows that is off the ground . ”
11128	11132	11133	11133	she	57	“ A stairwell ? ”
11148	11160	11136	11136	He	175	“ Come on . I think the stairs are this way . ”
11300	11306	11307	11307	Logan	175	“ You can sightsee later , ”
11317	11321	11307	11307	Logan	175	“ Come on . ”
11414	11418	11419	11419	Logan	175	“ Stay there , ”
11433	11449	11428	11428	he	175	“ I ’ll be right back . I ’m just going to check something out . ”
11605	11609	11610	11610	His	175	“ You okay ? ”
11631	11685	11623	11623	She	112	“ I think the noise is messing with my head . Marcus Aurelius said that ‘ It is not death that a man should fear , but he should fear never beginning to live . ’ Except I do n’t think he ever went through a hurricane . I almost prefer the elevator . ”
11686	11691	11692	11692	Logan	175	“ I do n’t , ”
11695	11708	11709	11709	He	175	“ Wait here . I picked up a few things for us . ”
11761	11768	11751	11751	he	175	“ What ’s all this for ? ”
11769	11816	11817	11817	She	112	“ Just in case it gets cold later . We want to be prepared . It ’s going to be a long night with that storm raging . This is probably the only safe place in the building that we can get to at the moment . ”
11842	11846	11847	11847	Logan	175	“ Thank you . ”
11955	11963	11964	11964	He	175	“ Is one of those for me ? ”
12042	12072	12034	12034	Logan	175	“ I had to raid the closest minibar . It ’s not a great selection , but it ’ll hold us until the worst of the storm passes overhead . ”
12088	12096	12081	12081	Brontë	112	“ I could kiss you for that . ”
12097	12101	12102	12102	he	175	“ You could , ”
12164	12167	12168	12168	Logan	175	“ Shhh , ”
12201	12210	12181	12181	he	175	“ I ’m here . We ’re safe . ”
12302	12308	12309	12309	She	112	“ Eat your candy bar . ”
12316	12339	12309	12309	She	112	“ Just so you know , in the future , I prefer M&M ’s . The peanut kind , not the plain . ”
12340	12354	12309	12309	She	112	“ I ’ll keep that in mind . Philosophy and peanut M&M ’s . ”
12355	12360	12361	12361	she	112	“ That ’s right , ”
12384	12393	12394	12394	She	112	“ This is really good . Thank you . ”
12422	12437	12438	12438	She	112	“ So how is it that you know Marcus Aurelius by heart , Brontë ? ”
12441	12465	12466	12466	She	112	“ My mother loved books , but she especially loved the classics — Brontë , Austen , and Gaskell . The romantic ones . ”
12474	12515	12466	12466	She	112	“ I graduated from UMKC with a BA in philosophy . Majored in that , minored in history . I like ancient philosophers . I feel like they taught a lot of wisdom that can be applied to modern life . ”
12516	12528	12529	12529	Brontë	112	“ Interesting . So you ’re . . . a teacher ? ”
12532	12545	12529	12529	Brontë	112	“ Hardly . I ’m a waitress at a sock hop diner . ”
12546	12553	12554	12554	He	352	“ A . . . waitress . ”
12563	12573	12554	12554	He	352	“ That ’s a bit of a career change . ”
12574	12612	12613	12613	She	112	“ Not really . I started waitressing to pay the bills during school and then kept waitressing while I hunted for jobs after graduating , and , well , two years later , I ’m still waitressing . ”
12624	12632	12554	12554	He	352	“ So you ’re twenty - four ? ”
12633	12642	12554	12554	He	352	“ I am . How old are you ? ”
12643	12651	12652	12652	She	112	“ I just turned twenty - nine . ”
12657	12664	12665	12665	He	352	“ Wow , that ’s ancient . ”
12668	12681	12682	12682	she	112	“ Seriously , though , you ’re doing really good for yourself , ”
12686	12705	12706	12706	He	352	“ Manager of a big place like this at twenty - nine ? Your parents must be proud . ”
12727	12731	12721	12721	he	352	“ Thank you . ”
13701	13704	13710	13710	her	112	“ Brontë , ”
13713	13718	13710	13710	her	112	“ Move your hand . ”
13731	13734	13719	13719	She	112	“ Brontë , ”
13739	13754	13719	13719	She	112	“ You ’ve got a rather . . . personal grip at the moment . ”
13826	13832	13818	13818	She	112	“ Oh , my God . ”
13839	13844	13845	13845	he	192	“ My thoughts exactly , ”
13866	13872	13859	13859	He	192	“ How are you doing ? ”
13934	13944	13924	13924	her	112	“ I ’m okay . Is it still raining ? ”
13945	13971	13972	13972	She	112	“ It sounds quieter . I think the worst of the storm has passed . We should probably get out and have a look around . ”
13978	13985	13972	13972	She	112	“ Can we find a bathroom ? ”
13986	13994	13924	13924	her	112	“ They probably wo n’t be working . ”
13995	14006	14007	14007	He	192	“ Yeah , but a nonworking toilet beats a stairwell . ”
14017	14021	14022	14022	She	112	“ Come on . ”
14169	14175	14177	14177	Logan	175	“ Not a good sign , ”
14179	14207	14177	14177	Logan	175	“ Stick close to me . If the water ’s come in this far , we do n’t know what the rest of the building looks like . ”
14208	14213	14214	14214	she	112	“ Or the island , ”
14353	14362	14346	14347	A rogue	388	“ You ’re not married , are you ? ”
14363	14366	14346	14347	A rogue	388	“ Huh ? ”
14367	14386	14346	14347	A rogue	388	“ Never mind . I just did n’t want to , you know , fondle a married man . ”
14387	14402	14346	14347	A rogue	388	“ So it ’s all right to fondle a man when he ’s single ? ”
14403	14423	14346	14347	A rogue	388	“ That ’s not what I meant , and you know it . I was just going to say — ”
14424	14430	14346	14347	A rogue	388	“ I ’m not married . ”
14431	14434	14435	14435	She	112	“ Oh . ”
14483	14487	14473	14473	she	112	“ Thank God . ”
14488	14498	14504	14504	him	175	“ I ’m also not looking for a relationship . ”
14515	14541	14502	14502	She	112	“ I was n’t asking because of that . This would just be . . . weird . . . if you had a wife . ”
14542	14551	14502	14502	She	112	“ We ’re not sleeping together , Brontë . ”
14552	14561	14502	14502	She	112	“ Well , technically , we just did . ”
14618	14624	14603	14603	She	112	“ Why all the questions ? ”
14625	14654	14655	14655	His	175	“ I was just curious . You know . If I ’d touched single junk or married junk . I think it ’s a reasonable thing to ask . ”
14697	14712	14683	14683	She	112	“ It only matters if you ’re planning on grabbing it again , Brontë . ”
14732	14749	14750	14750	His	175	“ Ah . Well . No , I was n’t making plans to do that again . ”
14758	14801	14750	14750	His	175	“ Well , now I ’m disappointed . Come on . I do n’t think it ’s safe to see if we can turn the power back on , so let ’s look for something that we can get some light with . ”
15099	15116	15117	15117	Logan	175	“ Wow . Your cleanup crew is going to be working some overtime , I think . ”
15132	15150	15117	15117	Logan	175	“ I was planning on renovating the place anyhow . Someone told me I needed thicker walls . ”
15162	15166	15151	15151	She	112	“ Good call . ”
15167	15172	15173	15173	he	175	“ I ’m starving , ”
15176	15214	15173	15173	he	175	“ We should head to the gift shop . We can probably find some supplies there . I ’m thinking water bottles , food , and maybe some dry clothes if it was n’t too badly hit . ”
15234	15250	15253	15253	she	112	“ Through the lobby and to the left , I think . Near the restaurant . ”
15267	15276	15257	15257	He	175	“ But of course , you know that . ”
15277	15281	15282	15282	His	175	“ Of course . ”
15299	15303	15293	15293	he	175	“ After you . ”
15502	15518	15500	15500	her	112	“ You do n’t think we ’re going to see any bodies , do you ? ”
15519	15524	15525	15525	He	175	“ I hope not . ”
15529	15540	15525	15525	He	175	“ If we ’re lucky , everyone else was evacuated . ”
15541	15559	15500	15500	her	112	“ Should we check the rest of the hotel ? Just in case anyone else was stranded ? ”
15560	15564	15565	15565	he	175	“ We will , ”
15578	15598	15500	15500	her	112	“ After we resupply ourselves . It wo n’t do us any good if you ’re fainting with hunger . ”
15599	15621	15525	15525	He	175	“ Me ? You make it sound like I ’m some weak flower on my last leg . What about you ? ”
15622	15628	15629	15629	She	112	“ I do n’t faint . ”
15632	15645	15629	15629	She	112	“ ‘ Nothing has more strength than dire necessity , ’ right ? ”
15646	15652	15500	15500	her	112	“ Another famous Plato gem ? ”
15653	15656	15500	15500	her	112	“ Euripides . ”
15657	15670	15629	15629	She	112	“ Of course . That was going to be my next guess . ”
15671	15682	15500	15500	her	112	“ Naturally . You ’re a big fan of Euripides ? ”
15683	15688	15689	15689	She	112	“ Who is n’t ? ”
15760	15767	15768	15768	he	175	“ The entire ceiling could collapse , ”
15772	15779	15768	15768	he	175	“ We have to be careful . ”
15780	15787	15788	15788	she	112	“ Now who ’s Suzy Sunshine ? ”
15885	15890	15891	15891	she	112	“ Just our luck , ”
15895	15902	15891	15891	she	112	“ Do you have the key ? ”
15903	15906	15907	15907	he	175	“ No , ”
15920	15924	15925	15925	She	112	“ Stay there . ”
15940	15946	15947	15947	He	175	“ What are you doing ? ”
15959	15967	15947	15947	He	175	“ Getting something better than a key . ”
15968	15974	15947	15947	He	175	“ What about the alarm ? ”
15975	15996	15997	15997	he	175	“ Either it ’s not working or we ’re going to need to hope that the gift shop has earplugs , ”
16008	16012	16013	16013	She	112	“ Stand back . ”
16216	16224	16209	16209	he	175	“ Alarm ’s dead . Come on . ”
16239	16252	16226	16226	she	112	“ What about all the glass ? We ’ll cut our feet . ”
16261	16269	16253	16253	He	175	“ You ’re right . Stay there . ”
16331	16335	16310	16310	he	175	“ Come on . ”
16399	16407	16384	16384	She	112	“ I think I ’m going to — ”
16441	16445	16446	16446	she	112	“ — fall , ”
16480	16484	16474	16474	He	175	“ You okay ? ”
16485	16492	16493	16493	She	112	“ Just feel stupid is all . ”
16515	16525	16507	16507	Brontë	112	“ Shoes ? We really should have brought ours . ”
16537	16554	16555	16555	He	175	“ I see them . Stay there . Only one of us should risk cut feet . ”
16629	16640	16627	16627	Lovely	72	“ I found you some water shoes . What size ? ”
16641	16644	16627	16627	Lovely	72	“ Seven . ”
16645	16659	16660	16660	He	175	“ This might be a seven . Hard to tell in the dark . ”
16740	16747	16736	16736	She	112	“ What supplies do we need ? ”
16748	16779	16780	16780	He	175	“ Flashlights , if we can find them . If not , something dry to use as a torch . Lighters . Food and water . Anything else you want . ”
16856	16863	16847	16847	she	112	“ I found some dry shirts . ”
16864	16875	16876	16876	She	112	“ Good , bring them . I found some lighters . ”
16979	16992	16971	16971	he	175	“ Now we can get a really good look at each other . ”
17199	17208	17186	17186	She	112	“ Hi there . Long time no see . ”
17220	17225	17186	17186	She	112	“ Hello , Brontë . ”
17240	17255	17228	17228	he	175	“ You could have looked at me before . It was n’t totally dark . ”
17256	17267	17268	17268	he	175	“ Yes , but now I get to see everything , ”
17283	17290	17268	17268	he	175	“ Not just shadows and suggestion . ”
17324	17336	17337	17337	They	414	“ I ’m just going to look for some more stuff . ”
17407	17414	17415	17415	He	175	“ I feel like a looter . ”
17424	17439	17415	17415	He	175	“ You are a looter . You are currently in the act of looting . ”
17440	17455	17472	17472	She	112	“ Gee , thanks . Are we going to get in trouble for this ? ”
17456	17471	17472	17472	She	112	“ Brontë , I ’m the manager . Just consider the tab on me . ”
17487	17505	17472	17472	She	112	“ How long do you think it ’ll take for them to get here and save us ? ”
17506	17521	17522	17522	She	112	“ I do n’t know . I ’ve never been in a hurricane before . ”
17571	17584	17585	17585	He	417	“ What if we ’re here for a week ? Or longer ? ”
17608	17619	17626	17626	her	112	“ Then we get to know each other really well . ”
17806	17810	17811	17811	Brontë	112	“ Pretty stuff , ”
17823	17828	17829	17829	he	175	“ You like that ? ”
17838	17859	17832	17832	She	112	“ What woman would n’t ? It ’s really gorgeous , but it probably costs an arm and a leg . ”
17860	17869	17870	17870	Her	112	“ Want me to loot it for you ? ”
17884	17888	17874	17874	She	112	“ Absolutely not . ”
17889	17892	17832	17832	She	112	“ Why ? ”
17893	17905	17906	17906	He	175	“ It ’s expensive , Logan . Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
17909	17939	17906	17906	He	175	“ The diamonds probably are n’t quality and I doubt that it ’s worth the markup , but if you want it , I ’ll get it for you . ”
17940	17949	17874	17874	She	112	“ No . We ’ll get in trouble . ”
17950	17968	17969	17969	He	175	“ Brontë , there ’s no one here . And I ’m the . . . manager . ”
17983	17992	17993	17993	she	112	“ I do n’t want it , Logan , ”
18000	18020	18021	18021	He	175	“ Looting it is wrong , and you ’d be crazy to risk being fired over something like that . ”
18024	18035	18021	18021	He	175	“ They ca n’t fire me , but suit yourself . ”
18358	18368	18354	18354	she	112	“ How long do you think this will last ? ”
18369	18380	18354	18354	she	112	“ Not long . We need to find something better . ”
18381	18410	18411	18411	She	112	“ We should check the rest of the resort , too . I ’d hate to think of someone else trapped in the elevators , waiting for rescue . ”
18462	18470	18453	18453	He	175	“ Should we check the upper floors ? ”
18471	18480	18481	18481	Logan	175	“ I ’m not sure it ’s wise , ”
18485	18526	18481	18481	Logan	175	“ You saw how badly the roof was destroyed in the lobby . We do n’t know that the other floors are n’t on the verge of collapse . We can take a look from outside tomorrow and decide then . ”
18527	18531	18532	18532	she	112	“ All right , ”
18542	18553	18481	18481	Logan	175	“ I guess we should crack open those chocolate bars ? ”
18554	18563	18564	18564	he	175	“ Or we could head to the kitchens , ”
18572	18591	18564	18564	he	175	“ See if there ’s anything worth saving now that the power ’s been off for a while . ”
18592	18600	18601	18601	She	112	“ Real food ? Sign me up . ”
18718	18722	18723	18723	Logan	175	“ Still cold , ”
18736	18751	18723	18723	Logan	175	“ Might be cold for a bit longer if we keep the door closed . ”
18778	18786	18787	18787	she	112	“ We should eat some of this , ”
18791	18802	18787	18787	she	112	“ Can we build a fire somewhere and cook some ? ”
18803	18820	18821	18821	They	435	“ If the stove does n’t work , yeah . Pick what you want to eat . ”
18991	19016	18980	18980	She	112	“ I think that was the best thing I ’ve ever eaten . I did n’t realize how hungry I was until just now . ”
19017	19027	19028	19028	They	441	“ We ’ve had our minds on other things . ”
19098	19114	19094	19094	she	112	“ I guess it ’d be bad manners to lick it , would n’t it ? ”
19115	19124	19094	19094	she	112	“ I ’m sure there are other cans . ”
19125	19135	19136	19136	she	112	“ Yes , but this one is right here , ”
19161	19173	19154	19154	His	175	“ You have some juice in the corner of your mouth . ”
20118	20123	20124	20124	she	112	“ You ’re frowning , ”
20128	20132	20124	20124	she	112	“ Everything okay ? ”
20133	20137	20146	20146	she	112	“ Just thinking . ”
20163	20171	20172	20172	Logan	175	“ Thinking that we need more chicken ? ”
20177	20182	20183	20183	he	175	“ Thinking about rescue , ”
20216	20226	20209	20209	Rescue	79	“ It might be days before anyone finds us . ”
20248	20265	20266	20266	Friends	465	“ I ’m thinking we ’ll just be really close friends by the end of this . ”
20285	20298	20299	20299	he	175	“ We do n’t know enough about each other to be friends , ”
20335	20348	20318	20318	Brontë	112	“ I guess we could learn , then , could n’t we ? ”
20349	20353	20354	20354	She	112	“ We could . ”
20362	20374	20354	20354	She	112	“ So how long have you lived here on the island ? ”
20384	20388	20389	20389	he	175	“ A year , ”
20394	20412	20389	20389	he	175	“ What made you decide to take a job here ? Did you live on the island ? ”
20413	20427	20389	20389	he	175	“ No . A friend . . . referred me to the owner . ”
20435	20445	20389	20389	he	175	“ I came here when I got the job . ”
20446	20453	20389	20389	he	175	“ Where did you move from ? ”
20454	20459	20389	20389	he	175	“ New York City . ”
20511	20517	20502	20502	She	112	“ Where are you from ? ”
20518	20531	20502	20502	She	112	“ The Midwest . Kansas City . Have you ever been there ? ”
20532	20540	20502	20502	She	112	“ Once or twice . For business . ”
20541	20561	20502	20502	She	112	“ You ’ve got one up on me , then . I ’ve never been to New York City . ”
20562	20574	20502	20502	She	112	“ You should go sometime . I ’ll show you around . ”
20594	20613	20590	20590	She	112	“ I ’d like that . Have you been to many shows ? Visited the Statue of Liberty ? ”
20614	20619	20620	20620	He	175	“ No and no . ”
20652	20658	20659	20659	she	112	“ That ’s a shame , ”
20671	20698	20659	20659	she	112	“ If I went to New York , I ’d want to visit it . Go get my picture taken and do all the touristy things . ”
20699	20707	20659	20659	she	112	“ You and a million other tourists . ”
20708	20735	20736	20736	she	112	“ True . I guess it ’s different when you ’re there . In Kansas City , those tourists just end up here at Seaturtle Cay , ”
20739	20746	20659	20659	she	112	“ Courtesy of 99.9 Pop Fever . ”
20747	20751	20659	20659	she	112	“ Pop Fever ? ”
20752	20784	20659	20659	she	112	“ Radio station . I won a trip . It ’s a little out of my price range to go anywhere normally . Too busy making ends meet and all that . ”
20819	20826	20827	20827	She	112	“ Out of your price range ? ”
20840	20858	20827	20827	She	112	“ Remember that I ’m a waitress . Pretty much everything is out of my price range . ”
20859	20872	20873	20873	She	112	“ You ’re smart . You can do something other than waitressing . ”
20876	20933	20873	20873	She	112	“ Actually , I like the waitressing . I like working with people . But the pay stinks . It covers the bills , but just barely . That ’s why I ’d been really hoping to enjoy this trip . It ’s the first vacation I ’ve had in two years , since I graduated . ”
20934	20946	20947	20947	he	471	“ I do n’t get away for vacation much , either , ”
20958	20977	20947	20947	he	471	“ Is n’t every day here like a vacation , though ? Sun and sand and palm trees — ”
20978	20982	20983	20983	She	112	“ And hurricanes . ”
20987	20996	20997	20997	He	471	“ True . Is this your first one ? ”
21024	21035	21036	21036	he	471	“ Every one of them feels like the first one , ”
21043	21051	21052	21052	She	112	“ I suppose that ’s true enough . ”
21055	21076	21052	21052	She	112	“ I still ca n’t believe Sharon left without me . I should n’t be surprised , but I am . ”
21077	21081	21082	21082	She	112	“ Your roommate ? ”
21085	21135	21136	21136	Brontë	112	“ She sent me up to her room to go look for her passport that she ’d lost . That was how I got stuck in the elevator . I never found it , so I assume she still had it and was able to get off the island . ”
21145	21160	21136	21136	Brontë	112	“ If it was n’t for her , I would n’t be stuck here . ”
21161	21170	21171	21171	he	472	“ Then I ’ll have to thank her , ”
21181	21200	21201	21201	Her	112	“ If I had to be stranded in a hurricane , I ’m glad it ’s with you . ”
21224	21237	21212	21212	she	112	“ I . . . thank you . That ’s very sweet . ”
21238	21246	21247	21248	Most people	473	“ I ’m not a sweet man . ”
21288	21296	21297	21297	Brontë	112	“ Oh , I do n’t know , ”
21304	21312	21297	21297	Brontë	112	“ You ’ve been nice to me . ”
21313	21333	21334	21334	She	51	“ That ’s because I like you . Most are n’t so lucky . I barely tolerate almost everyone . ”
21345	21354	21355	21355	She	51	“ Then I ’m glad you like me . ”
21367	21381	21355	21355	She	51	“ You ’re just saying that because you ’re stuck here with me . ”
21382	21411	21412	21412	She	51	“ No , I ’m saying it because you ’re smart , and funny , and beautiful . Being stranded with you has nothing to do with it . ”
21427	21435	21436	21436	she	51	“ I imagine work keeps you busy , ”
21442	21448	21449	21449	He	472	“ This place is enormous . ”
21475	21485	21458	21458	She	51	“ Do you have a big family , Logan ? ”
21486	21489	21490	21490	he	472	“ No , ”
21508	21513	21497	21497	He	472	“ Are you tired ? ”
21514	21519	21520	21520	She	51	“ Drained , really . ”
21528	21557	21520	21520	She	51	“ Okay , maybe a bit tired . Not looking forward to getting back to that stairwell , though . It ’s not exactly the height of comfort . ”
21558	21570	21571	21571	he	472	“ I have some ideas of how we can fix that , ”
21606	21615	21616	21616	He	472	“ Should n’t we do something about that ? ”
21631	21636	21616	21616	He	472	“ Taken care of . ”
22146	22150	22141	22141	He	476	“ Wake up . ”
22166	22171	22141	22141	He	476	“ Huh ? What ? ”
22172	22176	22177	22177	he	476	“ Calm down , ”
22181	22186	22187	22187	Brontë	112	“ Nothing ’s wrong . ”
22197	22203	22187	22187	Brontë	112	“ What time is it ? ”
22204	22217	22218	22218	She	51	“ My phone ’s dead . Water must have gotten into it . ”
22249	22267	22187	22187	Brontë	112	“ Damn it . There goes my battery . It said it ’s eleven a.m. , though . ”
22268	22282	22283	22283	They	484	“ We should head down to the kitchens and grab lunch , then . ”
22419	22434	22435	22435	Brontë	112	“ This is the first day it has n’t rained since I got here , ”
22478	22486	22487	22487	He	175	“ Should we check out the beach ? ”
22513	22518	22506	22506	she	112	“ If you like . ”
22523	22537	22519	22519	Her	112	“ I would . Do you think the beach is trashed , too ? ”
22538	22549	22551	22551	he	175	“ We ’ll soon find out , wo n’t we ? ”
22693	22707	22708	22708	She	112	“ It really did a number on this place , did n’t it ? ”
22828	22832	22833	22833	he	175	“ Come on , ”
22837	22847	22833	22833	he	175	“ Let ’s see what the beach looks like . ”
22939	22944	22928	22928	Brontë	112	“ It ’s gorgeous . ”
22987	22992	22983	22983	Brontë	112	“ What is it ? ”
22993	23031	23032	23032	He	175	“ I was just thinking that it figures that we have nice beach weather after my vacation has already been ruined . I would have loved to spend a few days just enjoying the sun and sand . ”
23041	23047	23032	23032	He	175	“ What ’s stopping you ? ”
23057	23074	23048	23048	Her	112	“ Should n’t we be working on making shelter or some other survival sorts of things ? ”
23075	23112	23113	23113	She	112	“ We have food . We have shelter . All we need to do is wait to be rescued . If it ’ll make you feel better , we can make an SOS on the sand . ”
23190	23199	23183	23183	Her	112	“ Should we go back and get swimsuits ? ”
23200	23203	23204	23204	Brontë	112	“ Why ? ”
23209	23213	23204	23204	Brontë	112	“ To swim ? ”
23249	23260	23261	23261	She	112	“ There ’s no one here but me , Brontë . ”
23272	23277	23278	23278	She	112	“ You ’re right . ”
23298	23307	23278	23278	She	112	“ Last one in ’s a rotten egg . ”
24170	24185	24186	24186	she	112	“ Well , you ’re definitely not a man who can resist a challenge , ”
24413	24420	24421	24421	he	175	“ For what it ’s worth , ”
24430	24444	24421	24421	he	175	“ My suggestion was going to be that we swim in our underwear . ”
24445	24448	24449	24449	she	112	“ Oh , ”
24468	24474	24449	24449	she	112	“ I was n’t sure — ”
24950	24957	24926	24926	He	175	“ Was that what you wanted ? ”
24975	24989	24965	24965	She	112	“ I was n’t sure what I wanted until just now , actually . ”
24990	24994	24965	24965	She	112	“ And now ? ”
24995	25010	25011	25011	she	112	“ Now I think I ’m rather glad we ’re alone on the beach , ”
25107	25112	25097	25097	Logan	175	“ More nervous laughter ? ”
25113	25125	25126	25126	she	112	“ No , this time I ’m totally laughing at you , ”
25423	25429	25430	25430	Brontë	112	“ I suppose we should , ”
25468	25491	25492	25492	She	112	“ There ’s enough driftwood on the beach that we could build a fire and hang out here a few hours more . ”
25495	25503	25492	25492	She	112	“ That sounds like a lovely idea . ”
25521	25548	25549	25549	Brontë	112	“ How about I work on the SOS and building a fire , and you go and get dry clothes and something to eat and drink ? ”
25556	25570	25549	25549	Brontë	112	“ Now that sounds like a plan . I ’ll be right back . ”
25571	25576	25577	25577	he	175	“ Take the flashlight , ”
25849	25854	25823	25823	He	175	“ You look great . ”
25913	25920	25901	25901	she	112	“ I did n’t do anything . ”
25921	25931	25936	25936	her	112	“ I know . But you still look great . ”
25940	25948	25949	25949	She	112	“ I ’m glad you ’re back . ”
25955	25965	25949	25949	She	112	“ I brought drinks , food , and dessert . ”
25966	25973	25901	25901	she	112	“ I ’m a lucky man . ”
25974	25979	25980	25980	she	112	“ And a flirt , ”
25991	26001	25980	25980	she	112	“ But I think that ’s a forgivable offense . ”
26092	26095	26076	26076	He	175	“ Thirsty ? ”
26142	26146	26130	26130	She	112	“ Just thinking . ”
26147	26151	26130	26130	She	112	“ Thinking about ? ”
26152	26162	26163	26163	She	112	“ How there ’s no one around for miles . ”
26182	26193	26194	26194	His	175	“ And how that can sometimes be a little frightening . ”
26240	26254	26237	26237	Logan	175	“ Do n’t be frightened . I ’m right here next to you . ”
26255	26260	26261	26261	she	112	“ I ’m glad , ”
26266	26281	26261	26261	she	112	“ I do n’t know what I ’d do if you were n’t here . ”
26282	26292	26293	26293	She	112	“ You ’d probably still be in the elevator . ”
26319	26329	26314	26314	she	112	“ I ’m glad you ’re here with me . ”
26383	26406	26373	26373	She	112	“ Do you want s’mores ? You know , chocolate and graham crackers and marshmallows ? They ’re the perfect camping treat . ”
26420	26434	26407	26407	He	175	“ I suppose this is a lot like camping , is n’t it ? ”
26435	26442	26443	26443	she	112	“ Right down to the campfire , ”
26449	26459	26443	26443	she	112	“ Do you have a stick for my marshmallow ? ”
26541	26553	26554	26554	Brontë	112	“ So you ’re one of those men , are you ? ”
26563	26569	26570	26570	She	112	“ One of what men ? ”
26579	26596	26570	26570	She	112	“ You ’re willing to eat a little charcoal as long as it gets done faster . ”
26597	26601	26602	26602	he	175	“ Collateral damage , ”
26606	26619	26602	26602	he	175	“ One expects that sort of thing when making a bold decision . ”
26620	26624	26625	26625	she	112	“ Very bold , ”
26631	26652	26653	26653	He	175	“ Could you blow out one of those bold decisions and put it on my cracker so I can eat ? ”
26804	26810	26811	26811	he	175	“ Speaking of bold decisions , ”
26827	26832	26811	26811	he	175	“ Have you decided ? ”
26833	26836	26837	26837	she	112	“ Decided ? ”
26847	26900	26837	26837	she	112	“ You and I keep dancing around our attraction without ever really coming out and saying exactly what we ’re thinking . I ’m not like that , Brontë . I ’m the kind of guy that wants to let you know exactly how I feel , but you keep running away . ”
26901	26907	26908	26908	she	112	“ I ’m not running , ”
26914	26918	26908	26908	she	112	“ Tell me . ”
26919	26927	26928	26928	His	175	“ I ’ll show you , then . ”
27022	27030	27018	27018	Logan	175	“ It ’s your move , Brontë . ”
27351	27356	27357	27357	she	112	“ I want this , ”
27364	27378	27357	27357	she	112	“ but I do n’t know how good I am at casual relationships . ”
27379	27390	27391	27391	he	175	“ We can worry about that once we ’re rescued , ”
27537	27544	27522	27522	He	175	“ Should I not have asked ? ”
27545	27552	27553	27553	she	112	“ No , asking is good , ”
27563	27576	27553	27553	she	112	“ I ’m just not exactly at my hottest at the moment . ”
27577	27582	27583	27583	She	112	“ Quote me something . ”
27603	27613	27553	27553	she	112	“ ‘ Happiness depends upon ourselves . ’ Aristotle . ”
27614	27617	27618	27618	He	175	“ See ? ”
27629	27639	27640	27640	She	112	“ Hearing you say that is so incredibly hot . ”
27644	27651	27640	27640	She	112	“ You ’re a strange man . ”
27652	27658	27659	27659	he	175	“ And you ’re beautiful , ”
27663	27679	27659	27659	he	175	“ I have n’t been able to take my eyes off of you all day . ”
27703	27708	27690	27690	She	112	“ Then kiss me ? ”
27709	27715	27716	27716	He	175	“ You have to ask ? ”
27721	27726	27727	27727	she	112	“ Asking ’s good , ”
27930	27933	27934	27934	he	175	“ Careful , ”
27958	27967	27938	27938	His	175	“ It seems my kiss is rather dangerous . ”
27968	27971	27972	27972	she	112	“ Extremely , ”
28012	28027	28004	28004	Brontë	112	“ In fact , I might need to lie down to get my bearings . ”
28059	28062	28042	28042	he	175	“ Better ? ”
28145	28151	28118	28118	She	112	“ Should we go inside ? ”
28152	28158	28118	28118	She	112	“ Do you want to ? ”
28159	28165	28166	28166	she	112	“ I do n’t know , ”
28203	28216	28118	28118	She	112	“ I want to stay out here but it feels . . . ”
28217	28220	28233	28233	his	175	“ Wrong ? ”
28221	28229	28233	28233	his	175	“ I was going to say naughty . ”
28242	28248	28249	28249	She	112	“ And naughty is bad ? ”
28273	28294	28249	28249	She	112	“ Actually , no . Now that I think about it , I rather like naughty . What about you ? ”
28295	28309	28310	28310	She	112	“ I do n’t have condoms out here . Unless you brought them . ”
28365	28374	28343	28343	she	112	“ No , I did n’t bring any . ”
28375	28382	28383	28383	He	175	“ Then I can pull out . ”
28398	28406	28407	28407	His	175	“ If you ’re okay with that . ”
28422	28437	28407	28407	His	175	“ I ’m good with that . I ’m clean , by the way . ”
28438	28443	28444	28444	he	175	“ So am I , ”
28447	28458	28444	28444	he	175	“ Are you sure you would n’t rather go inside ? ”
28459	28468	28407	28407	His	175	“ No , I like it out here . ”
28469	28475	28476	28476	She	112	“ Where it ’s naughty ? ”
28479	28482	28476	28476	She	112	“ Precisely . ”
28644	28648	28649	28649	Brontë	112	“ Touch me , ”
28654	28657	28649	28649	Brontë	112	“ Please . ”
28763	28776	28756	28756	Logan	175	“ Maybe I want to keep kissing you for a bit longer . ”
28777	28784	28785	28785	she	112	“ That ’s okay , too , ”
28973	28977	28965	28965	she	112	“ Like that ? ”
29087	29091	29092	29092	he	175	“ Like that ? ”
29096	29101	29102	29102	she	112	“ Just like that , ”
29164	29171	29172	29172	She	112	“ Let ’s take this off . ”
29359	29376	29377	29377	His	175	“ Your breasts are beautiful . I ’ve been wanting to play with them all afternoon . ”
29397	29410	29411	29411	She	112	“ Watching them naked and glistening with water was driving me mad . ”
29490	29493	29485	29485	Her	112	“ Logan . ”
29494	29503	29504	29504	he	175	“ Love it when you say my name , ”
29514	29519	29520	29520	she	112	“ Oh , Logan , ”
29530	29539	29523	29523	he	175	“ God , you feel so incredibly good . ”
29540	29545	29546	29546	he	175	“ Let ’s see , ”
29584	29588	29589	29589	She	112	“ Definitely wet . ”
29632	29637	29605	29605	she	112	“ Oh , God . ”
29638	29641	29642	29642	he	175	“ Logan , ”
29662	29677	29651	29651	he	175	“ I want you to say my name again while I ’m touching you . ”
29678	29681	29682	29682	she	112	“ Logan , ”
29785	29792	29772	29772	she	112	“ I — I’m going to — ”
29793	29796	29797	29797	He	175	“ Come . ”
29892	29895	29896	29896	she	112	“ Oh , ”
29903	29909	29896	29896	she	112	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
29921	29925	29910	29910	He	175	“ About what ? ”
29926	29932	29933	29933	she	112	“ Y - your shoulder , ”
29938	29944	29933	29933	she	112	“ I ’m hurting you . ”
29945	29954	29955	29955	he	175	“ You ’re not hurting me , Brontë , ”
30029	30049	30050	30050	He	175	“ I want you to keep touching me . I do n’t care if you claw up my back . ”
30066	30078	30050	30050	He	175	“ I like your reactions . They feel real to me . ”
30097	30113	30088	30088	she	112	“ I ’m not very good at faking these things . Sorry to disappoint you . ”
30114	30118	30119	30119	he	175	“ Not disappointed , ”
30151	30160	30142	30142	her	112	“ And I know you were n’t faking . ”
30171	30179	30180	30180	He	175	“ Exactly how do you know that ? ”
30202	30207	30189	30189	she	112	“ Because of that . ”
30234	30238	30239	30239	he	175	“ And that , ”
30242	30276	30277	30277	She	112	“ If I had a finger sunk deep inside you when you came , you ’d clenched all around me , would n’t you ? Milk my finger like you would my cock . ”
30293	30321	30277	30277	She	112	“ You ’re sweet , and you ’re smart , and sexy , and so very real , Brontë . That ’s what I like about you . ”
30346	30354	30355	30355	she	112	“ I like you too , Logan , ”
30372	30379	30355	30355	she	112	“ I want to touch you . ”
30380	30387	30388	30388	he	175	“ I want to fuck you , ”
30401	30409	30395	30395	she	112	“ I promise I ’ll pull out . ”
30500	30503	30495	30495	He	175	“ Virgin ? ”
30509	30524	30504	30504	She	112	“ Just been a while , that ’s all . Give me a moment . ”
30590	30599	30600	30600	she	112	“ Oh . . . do that again , ”
30975	30982	30965	30965	he	175	“ Wh - what was that ? ”
31023	31028	31008	31008	he	175	“ G - spot . ”
31061	31066	31067	31067	He	175	“ I need more . ”
31310	31314	31315	31315	she	112	“ Thank you , ”
31319	31323	31324	31324	He	175	“ Thank you ? ”
31329	31334	31324	31324	He	175	“ For pulling out ? ”
31335	31338	31339	31339	she	112	“ No , ”
31352	31382	31383	31383	He	175	“ For showing me where the G - spot was . I had no idea . I think I ’m ruined for non - G - spot sex now . ”
31392	31402	31383	31383	He	175	“ I would n’t be so sure about that . ”
31403	31429	31430	31430	She	112	“ Well , okay , it ’d have to be really great sex to make up for the lack of the G - spot attention . ”
31446	31459	31430	31430	She	112	“ I think I ’m going to go take a quick dunk . ”
31460	31466	31430	31430	She	112	“ It ’s probably cold . ”
31467	31481	31482	31482	she	112	“ ‘ You will never do anything in this world without courage , ’ ”
31487	31493	31494	31494	He	175	“ Is that a challenge ? ”
31526	31539	31546	31546	she	112	“ Are you saying I ’m not brave enough for cold water ? ”
31540	31545	31546	31546	she	112	“ Not at all , ”
31615	31621	31622	31622	Logan	175	“ There ’s your courage , ”
31996	31999	32000	32000	She	586	“ manager . ”
32852	32857	32835	32835	Brontë	112	“ Mmm , Logan . ”
32866	32879	32858	32858	He	175	“ I was wondering what it ’d take to wake you up . ”
32880	32887	32888	32888	she	112	“ That ’s a good way , ”
32899	32917	32892	32892	Her	112	“ It ’s a shame you woke up before I had to resort to more insistent tactics . ”
32918	32921	32922	32922	She	112	“ Oh ? ”
32946	32954	32892	32892	Her	112	“ What did you have in mind ? ”
32955	32970	32978	32978	He	175	“ Burying my face between your legs and licking your pussy until you came . ”
32988	32994	32978	32978	He	175	“ What are you thinking ? ”
32995	33007	33008	33008	she	112	“ I ’m thinking I should have slept a bit longer , ”
33017	33025	33026	33026	Logan	175	“ I miss all the good stuff . ”
33038	33044	33026	33026	Logan	175	“ I can be persuaded . ”
33045	33048	33049	33049	He	175	“ Oh ? ”
33089	33097	33071	33071	He	175	“ You could . . . ask . ”

33974	33983	33984	33984	she	112	“ Only if it ’s not any good , ”
34005	34018	33956	33956	he	175	“ Okay , okay , you win . It was pretty decent . ”
34019	34030	34031	34031	He	175	“ Do I need to prove my skills to you ? ”
34039	34047	34048	34048	she	112	“ I might need a little convincing , ”
34059	34068	34069	34069	he	175	“ I should get to work , then , ”
34336	34339	34326	34326	Brontë	112	“ between careers ”

35013	35036	35001	35001	Logan	175	“ I thought I ’d like to take my date out to dinner . Or breakfast , as the case may be . ”
35084	35092	35060	35060	She	112	“ I hope it ’s not chocolate . ”
35093	35112	35113	35113	He	175	“ It ’s not . First , we have a fine vintage that I think you ’ll appreciate . ”
35146	35151	35139	35139	She	112	“ It looks delicious . ”

35277	35290	35291	35291	She	112	“ Something like that . Should I bring out the next course ? ”
35295	35299	35291	35291	She	112	“ Please do . ”
35347	35361	35342	35342	She	112	“ Where did you get this ? I thought we picked through everything ! ”
35362	35387	35342	35342	She	112	“ I found it in the concierge room while looking for batteries for the flashlights . I thought it ’d make a nice breakfast . ”

35533	35540	35524	35524	she	112	“ I know just the thing . ”
35541	35555	35524	35524	she	112	“ How can I resist when it ’s proposed to me like that ? ”
35556	35561	35562	35562	she	112	“ You ca n’t , ”
35598	35601	35590	35590	she	112	“ Brontë ? ”

35676	35689	35690	35690	He	175	“ Thought I ’d help myself to a little treat is all . ”
35725	35734	35735	35735	he	175	“ You do n’t have to do this , ”

36212	36218	36219	36219	he	175	“ Your mouth is amazing , ”
36342	36349	36350	36350	he	175	“ I ’m going to come , ”
36354	36360	36350	36350	he	175	“ If you do n’t — ”

36584	36587	36568	36568	Logan	175	“ Helicopter . ”
36588	36591	36592	36592	She	112	“ Rescue ? ”
36624	36639	36614	36614	He	175	“ Come on . Let ’s get our stuff and see who ’s here . ”
36843	36847	36848	36848	Logan	175	“ Come on , ”
36897	36905	36885	36885	He	175	“ I think I recognize that chopper . ”
37021	37027	37028	37028	he	175	“ I should have guessed , ”
37036	37064	37028	37028	he	175	“ You looked entirely too happy for a man who ’s been stranded for a few days , but I guess the company was good , right ? ”
37065	37070	37071	37071	Logan	175	“ This is Brontë , ”
37075	37086	37071	37071	Logan	175	“ She was stuck in the same elevator I was . ”
37087	37098	37099	37100	the man	175	“ You picked a good elevator to get stuck in , ”
37111	37117	37099	37100	the man	175	“ Nice to meet you . ”
37215	37224	37225	37225	she	112	“ We ’re so glad to see you , ”
37236	37258	37225	37225	she	112	“ I guess I picked the right hotel to be stranded at if it ’s the one with the private helicopter . ”
37384	37397	37398	37400	the new guy	44	“ Does this dump of a resort have a helicopter , Logan ? ”
37412	37417	37403	37403	Logan	175	“ It does not . ”
37418	37421	37422	37423	The newcomer	44	“ Huh . ”
37432	37441	37422	37423	The newcomer	44	“ I ’m Jonathan , by the way . ”
37448	37459	37460	37460	she	112	“ You do n’t work for the hotel , Jonathan ? ”
37473	37497	37463	37463	He	44	“ Hell , no . And if anybody asked , this is a Red Cross helicopter . Or Coast Guard . Or something . ”
37498	37503	37504	37504	Logan	175	“ It ’s not ? ”
37512	37522	37526	37526	he	175	“ We ’ll talk about this later , Brontë . ”
37545	37551	37534	37534	She	112	“ What ’s going on ? ”
37558	37565	37552	37552	She	112	“ Who are you , exactly ? ”
37566	37572	37573	37573	he	48	“ Just an old friend , ”
37582	37597	37573	37573	he	48	“ And somehow I ’m thinking Logan ’s in trouble , is n’t he ? ”
37675	37688	37668	37668	She	112	“ You ’re not the manager of this place , are you ? ”
37689	37694	37695	37695	His	1619	“ I ’m not . ”
37702	37708	37709	37709	He	1619	“ Then who are you ? ”
37720	37728	37729	37729	He	1619	“ He ’s the owner , baby . ”
38070	38072	38057	38057	she	112	“ liar ”
38074	38076	38057	38057	she	112	“ jerk ”
38078	38081	38057	38057	she	112	“ untrustworthy . ”
38231	38236	38224	38224	Logan	175	“ Where are we ? ”
38289	38309	38283	38283	He	175	“ One of my summer homes in Miami . You can stay here until we get things sorted out . ”
38469	38502	38453	38453	Jonathan	48	“ You can stay here , Brontë . I only have a few guest rooms in this house , so if you do n’t like it , we can switch your room . ”
38503	38512	38513	38513	she	112	“ I ’m sure it ’ll be fine , ”
38547	38553	38554	38554	Logan	175	“ She stays with me , ”
38569	38576	38577	38577	He	175	“ I want my own room . ”
38592	38599	38577	38577	He	175	“ You ’re staying with me . ”
38600	38605	38606	38606	Jonathan	48	“ Is that so ? ”
38613	38626	38627	38627	He	175	“ In that case , I guess you can stay with Logan . ”
38633	38640	38627	38627	He	175	“ It ’s your usual room . ”
38660	38678	38655	38655	She	112	“ Care to show me which room that is ? I think I ’d like a shower . ”
38690	38721	38679	38679	Jonathan	48	“ I ’ll let lover boy here do the honors . I need to make a few calls . Feel free to head downstairs when you ’re up to it . ”
38771	38780	38757	38757	She	112	“ You have some serious explaining to do . ”
38781	38796	38797	38797	he	175	“ I know , and we ’ll talk about it later . I promise , ”
38839	38845	38828	38828	he	175	“ This is our room . ”
38912	38916	38917	38917	Ugh	68	“ usual room . ”
38967	38972	38973	38973	Logan	175	“ Make yourself comfortable , ”
38977	39005	39006	39006	She	112	“ I need to meet with Jonathan to discuss a few things and then call my assistant . I ’ve been out of pocket for too long . ”
39018	39027	39006	39006	She	112	“ I thought we were going to talk . ”
39028	39033	39006	39006	She	112	“ It can wait . ”
39034	39046	39006	39006	She	112	“ No , it ca n’t . You lied to me . ”
39047	39057	39058	39058	She	112	“ The lie ended up being to your benefit . ”
39061	39075	39058	39058	She	112	“ My benefit ? Since when is lying to someone to their benefit ? ”
39076	39081	39082	39082	he	175	“ I ’m wealthy , ”
39085	39116	39117	39117	He	175	“ I ’m sure that ’ll make up for a lot of things . Take a shower , and you ’ll feel better . I need to talk to Jonathan . ”
39552	39566	39539	39539	she	112	“ I need a car to take me to the airport , please . ”
39567	39577	39539	39539	she	112	“ No problem . What ’s your current address ? ”
39578	39594	39595	39596	The woman	365	“ I have no idea . Can you do a reverse lookup on the number ? ”
39613	39632	39595	39596	The woman	365	“ I ’ve got the address . Someone will be there to pick you up in fifteen minutes . ”
39889	39902	39903	39903	He	175	“ Need a drink ? You look like you could use one . ”
39909	39926	39927	39927	Jonathan	48	“ The only drink I could use right now is water . Alcohol just dehydrates you . ”
39932	39963	39927	39927	Jonathan	48	“ You never loosen up , do you ? It ’s a wonder that your little gal pal did n’t run away screaming as soon as you opened your mouth . ”
40023	40031	40032	40032	Jonathan	48	“ We got stuck in an elevator . ”
40040	40069	40032	40032	Jonathan	48	“ Is that how you got left behind ? I was wondering if that shit manager of the place had neglected to tell anyone that you were there . ”
40070	40081	40085	40085	Logan	175	“ I fired him a few hours before the evacuation . ”
40100	40111	40032	40032	Jonathan	48	“ How ’d you figure out I was still there ? ”
40112	40161	40162	40162	Jonathan	48	“ Oh , Hunter ’s assistant ’s been trying to get a hold of you for something , and when he could n’t contact you for a couple of days , he set Hunter on it . Hunter did n’t have a chopper , so he called me . ”
40165	40177	40162	40162	Jonathan	48	“ Was n’t hard to figure out where you were at . ”
40192	40199	40200	40200	Jonathan	48	“ Thank you for the rescue . ”
40203	40223	40200	40200	Jonathan	48	“ I figured I ’d come after you . It might have taken anyone else a few more days . ”
40280	40295	40271	40271	Logan	175	“ So . . . the girl . You said her name was Brontë ? ”
40324	40337	40312	40312	Her	112	“ Cute girl . She ’s with you , I take it ? ”
40349	40352	40353	40353	Jonathan	48	“ Why ? ”
40358	40377	40353	40353	Jonathan	48	“ Down , boy . I was just going to comment that she was n’t your regular type . ”
40389	40400	40353	40353	Jonathan	48	“ What exactly do you know about my regular type ? ”
40401	40438	40312	40312	Her	112	“ They ’re friendlier , for one . That girl looked like she was ready to chew you up and spit you out once she found out you owned the place . You lied to her ? ”
40439	40464	40353	40353	Jonathan	48	“ She saw my suit and assumed I was the manager . I decided not to disabuse her of that assumption . Seemed easier . ”
40465	40477	40478	40478	Jonathan	48	“ Well , I guess she ’s not a gold digger , ”
40481	40490	40478	40478	Jonathan	48	“ She did look pretty pissed , though . ”
40491	40505	40353	40353	Jonathan	48	“ She ’ll get over it . The lie was to her benefit . ”
40506	40524	40525	40525	Logan	175	“ Shit , man , that ’s cold . I hope you did n’t tell her that . ”
40596	40619	40582	40582	he	175	“ She ’s not like other women . She ’ll realize that I was protecting my identity and be fine with it . ”
40673	40697	40660	40660	He	175	“ If you say so . You know her better than I do . What did you say she did for a living ? ”
40698	40701	40702	40702	Jonathan	48	“ Nothing . ”
40714	40722	40702	40702	Jonathan	48	“ What do you mean , nothing ? ”
40723	40743	40744	40744	He	175	“ I mean she does nothing for a living . She ’s a waitress at a sock hop diner . ”
40757	40768	40744	40744	He	175	“ She worked there during college and never really left . ”
40769	40803	40804	40804	Logan	175	“ Ah . I ’m starting to see why you kept your identity a secret . Afraid she ’s going to look to you to keep her in the lifestyle that she needs ? ”
41046	41062	41043	41043	his	175	“ She ’s not like that , Jonathan . She ’s different . Trust me . ”
41063	41084	41085	41086	His friend	695	“ If you say so . She seems nice enough , the few minutes she was n’t glaring at you . ”
41104	41113	41085	41086	His friend	695	“ I ’ll make it up to her , ”
41164	41174	41158	41158	he	48	“ You said she wo n’t hold a grudge ? ”
41180	41190	41175	41175	Logan	175	“ And that she ’s different from most women ? ”
41191	41201	41202	41202	Jonathan	48	“ Where are you going with this , Jonathan ? ”
41210	41251	41202	41202	Jonathan	48	“ She ’s definitely different , I ’ll give her that . I ’m thinking she was so overcome at the news of your wealth that she felt the need to run . Your ladylove just escaped in a cab . ”
41294	41303	41289	41289	He	175	“ Where do you think she ’s going ? ”
41304	41309	41310	41310	He	175	“ Away from you ? ”
41329	41338	41339	41339	Jonathan	48	“ Go tell your driver to follow them . ”
41346	41374	41339	41339	Jonathan	48	“ You ’re joking , right ? She ’s a free woman . She ’s allowed to leave . Why do n’t you call her and apologize ? ”
41401	41409	41387	41387	He	175	“ I do n’t have her number . ”
41420	41447	41410	41410	Jonathan	48	“ So call your private investigator and ask him to look her up . There ca n’t be that many Brontës running around , can there ? ”
41649	41654	41640	41640	Sharon	57	“ You ’re home ! ”
41655	41659	41660	41660	she	57	“ I am , ”
41673	41680	41660	41660	she	57	“ Did you get home okay ? ”
41681	41748	41749	41749	She	57	“ I did ! Did you know that my passport was in the bar ? Silly me . Anyhow , a nice man found it and gave it to me just before I got on a bus . I ended up spending the rest of the trip in some low - rent hotel on Miami Beach . It was free , but it was n’t great . ”
41752	41784	41785	41785	Brontë	112	“ I tried calling you , though . You never answered and I could n’t find you , and I could n’t stick around . Which bus did you get on ? ”
41811	41832	41833	41833	Sharon	57	“ I did n’t get on a bus . I got stuck in an elevator when the power went out . ”
41839	41845	41833	41833	Sharon	57	“ The power went out ? ”
41846	41856	41857	41857	she	57	“ Misfortune shows those who are not really friends , ”
41906	41921	41889	41889	Brontë	112	“ That ’s right . I was stuck in there for almost a day . ”
41922	41926	41927	41927	She	112	“ By yourself ? ”
41932	41942	41927	41927	She	112	“ No , there was a guy in there . ”
41955	41960	41961	41961	She	112	“ Was he hot ? ”
41968	41987	41961	41961	She	112	“ You ’re blushing . He was hot , was n’t he ? Did you two hook up ? ”
41988	41992	41993	41993	Brontë	112	“ Island fling , ”
42001	42008	41993	41993	Brontë	112	“ Just like we talked about . ”
42009	42014	42015	42015	Sharon	57	“ How totally romantic ! ”
42028	42046	42015	42015	Sharon	57	“ So it was just you two , all alone in a big resort . . . . ”
42047	42054	42055	42055	Brontë	112	“ Do n’t forget the hurricane , ”
42059	42087	42088	42088	She	112	“ And anyhow , it was just a momentary thing . It ’s done . Over with . I did n’t even ask for his phone number . ”
42115	42133	42100	42100	Sharon	57	“ Hound dog , huh ? Maybe he only looked good in the middle of a hurricane . ”
42134	42143	42144	42144	She	57	“ I said he was good - looking . ”
42240	42259	42260	42260	Sharon	57	“ If he ’s so hot and studly , why did n’t you bother to get the digits ? ”
42273	42286	42266	42266	she	57	“ Was he bad in bed ? Is that why you ran ? ”
42287	42293	42294	42294	Brontë	112	“ I did n’t run , ”
42298	42307	42294	42294	Brontë	112	“ And this is none of your business . ”
42308	42313	42314	42314	Sharon	57	“ Bad in bed , ”
42412	42415	42407	42407	She	57	“ loaded , ”
42920	42924	42925	42926	the detective	773	“ Found her , ”
42932	42956	42925	42926	the detective	773	“ I ’m sending the information over to your personal e - mail address . Let me know if you have any questions . ”
42957	42961	42962	42962	Logan	175	“ Excellent work , ”
43527	43530	43519	43519	He	175	“ Hello ? ”
43543	43550	43519	43519	He	175	“ It ’s me , Brontë . ”
43559	43567	43551	43551	He	175	“ Do n’t call me . Please . ”
43568	43572	43519	43519	He	175	“ I wanted — ”
43573	43579	43580	43580	She	783	“ You ’re a liar . ”
43674	43677	43678	43678	Brontë	112	“ Hello ? ”
43715	43724	43725	43725	Sharon	57	“ Hey , Bron , it ’s me . ”
43729	43738	43739	43739	She	57	“ You ’re not going to believe this . ”
43749	43754	43739	43739	She	57	“ What is it ? ”
43755	43761	43725	43725	Sharon	57	“ The diner was sold . ”
43762	43765	43766	43766	Brontë	112	“ Sold ? ”
43774	43782	43766	43766	Brontë	112	“ Do we still have our jobs ? ”
43783	43810	43739	43739	She	57	“ As far as I know . But the new management has called a meeting this morning at nine , and they want everyone to attend . ”
43811	43819	43820	43820	Brontë	112	“ Gotcha . I ’ll be there . ”
43996	43999	44000	44000	she	57	“ Hi , ”
44035	44041	44026	44028	the old manager	799	“ Did I miss anything ? ”
44042	44046	44047	44047	Angie	96	“ Not yet , ”
44062	44075	44026	44028	the old manager	799	“ You think the new boss is going to shut us down ? ”
44076	44080	44081	44081	Brontë	112	“ Surely not , ”
44084	44093	44094	44094	Marj	97	“ Then why call us all in here ? ”
44104	44115	44099	44099	Brontë	112	“ Maybe he just wanted to meet us all personally ? ”
44121	44147	44116	44116	Sharon	57	“ I caught a good look at him . I ’d like to meet him up close and personal . Rowr . He ’s sexy . ”
44148	44155	44156	44156	Marj	97	“ He ’s your new boss , ”
44159	44166	44156	44156	Marj	97	“ Keep your hormones under wraps . ”
44167	44172	44173	44173	Brontë	112	“ You saw him ? ”
44176	44182	44156	44156	Marj	97	“ Does he seem nice ? ”
44183	44193	44194	44194	Sharon	57	“ I do n’t care if he ’s nice , ”
44208	44232	44199	44199	She	57	“ I told you he was cute , did n’t I ? I think he likes me . He keeps looking over here . ”
44253	44258	44259	44259	Sharon	57	“ Do n’t look ! ”
44262	44269	44259	44259	Sharon	57	“ You ’re being too obvious . ”
44280	44287	44270	44270	She	57	“ Is he in the kitchen ? ”
44288	44298	44299	44304	A pair of men in suits	807	“ Yep . Oh , here he comes now . ”
44369	44380	44381	44381	Sharon	57	“ Which one did you say was the new owner ? ”
44384	44422	44381	44381	Sharon	57	“ It ’s not the old geezer . The hot one . He bought the place . Seems he ’s an investor of some kind . Likes to buy businesses and turn them over for a profit . ”
44681	44693	44668	44668	she	57	“ Mr. Hawkings is the new owner of Josie ’s Diner , ”
44701	44766	44696	44696	he	175	“ Over the next few weeks , we ’re going to be looking carefully at every aspect of the business to determine where the most profit can be made . This means an inspection of purchasing , cooking , hours clocked in , and anything else you can think of . Mr. Hawkings is simply here to show you his commitment to the business . ”
44796	44819	44820	44820	He	175	“ I ’d like to meet with each of you individually so you have nothing to fear in regard to your job . ”
44847	44855	44856	44856	She	112	“ I ’ll start with Brontë Dawson . ”
44868	44873	44874	44874	He	175	“ Please follow me . ”
44926	44933	44900	44900	Logan	175	“ Please , have a seat . ”
44959	44976	44934	44934	She	112	“ You can drop the charade , Logan . We both know why you ’re here . ”
44977	44980	44981	44981	He	175	“ Oh ? ”
44993	45004	44981	44981	He	175	“ You ’re doing this to get back at me . ”
45026	45047	45020	45020	Logan	175	“ Perhaps you are not aware that my business excels at purchasing small , failing companies and making them profitable ? ”
45058	45072	45052	45052	she	112	“ Is that why you bought this one ? Because it was failing ? ”
45073	45076	45077	45077	he	175	“ No , ”
45087	45107	45077	45077	he	175	“ I purchased this one because I knew it was the only way I could speak to you again . ”
45108	45121	45122	45122	She	112	“ So I was right . This is about me and you . ”
45129	45146	45122	45122	She	112	“ It seemed like a bit too much of a coincidence that you showed up here . ”
45147	45152	45153	45153	he	175	“ You got me , ”
45190	45200	45201	45201	Her	112	“ I did get you , did n’t I ? ”
45210	45225	45201	45201	Her	112	“ The problem is , you seem to think I want more of you . ”
45226	45232	45233	45233	he	175	“ I think you do , ”
45277	45292	45271	45271	she	112	“ I think the real problem here is that you ’re mad at me . ”
45293	45298	45299	45299	She	112	“ Mad at you ? ”
45307	45327	45328	45328	She	112	“ How can I be mad at you ? I do n’t even know who you are . Remember ? ”
45336	45352	45353	45353	Brontë	112	“ If you ’re not mad at me , then why avoid my phone calls ? ”
45370	45403	45353	45353	Brontë	112	“ Because I went to that island to hook up with someone . You were nothing more than an island fling . I ’m not interested in carrying on something off the island ”
45404	45409	45353	45353	Brontë	112	“ You ’re lying . ”
45410	45424	45353	45353	Brontë	112	“ You should know what it ’s like . You ’re a liar . ”
45425	45429	45353	45353	Brontë	112	“ Am I ? ”
45430	45440	45441	45441	She	112	“ You did n’t tell me who you were . ”
45450	45503	45441	45441	She	112	“ You let me go on and on about the hotel , all because I thought you were the manager . Except you were n’t . You were the owner . And you never bothered to share that with me . You just kept it from me and laughed behind my back . ”
45504	45513	45514	45514	His	818	“ Is that what you think of me ? ”
45520	45535	45514	45514	His	818	“ That I lied to you because I was laughing at you ? Truly ? ”
45536	45547	45548	45548	she	818	“ I do n’t know what to think of you , ”
45560	45575	45548	45548	she	818	“ I do n’t know you , remember ? You made that very clear . ”
45576	45602	45603	45603	She	818	“ I had my reasons for keeping my identity a secret from you , Brontë , and none of my reasons involve laughing at you . ”
45687	45699	45700	45700	he	175	“ You know who I am now , do n’t you ? ”
45703	45714	45715	45715	she	818	“ The entire world seems to know who you are , ”
45719	45734	45715	45715	she	818	“ Stupid me was the only one that did n’t clue in to it . ”
45735	45741	45742	45742	he	175	“ You ’re not stupid , ”
45746	45804	45805	45805	He	175	“ Do n’t speak of yourself like that . I doubt you ’d be familiar with my face unless you read the Wall Street Journal or followed the business section in the papers . And I ’m not even sure then . Just because you have a lot of money does n’t mean you ’re a celebrity . ”
45808	45820	45805	45805	He	175	“ It does change how they react to you , though . ”
45831	45834	45805	45805	He	175	“ Oh ? ”
45835	45888	45889	45889	She	818	“ Most women I meet are more interested in my wallet than who I am . I thought I was going to be stuck in an elevator for God knows how long . I did n’t want it to be with someone who only saw dollar signs when she looked at me . ”
45899	45909	45889	45889	She	818	“ You should have had more faith in me . ”
45910	45917	45918	45918	he	818	“ I did n’t know you , ”
45930	45983	45918	45918	he	818	“ We spent days together , and I feel like we still do n’t know enough about each other . The time we had ? It was n’t enough . I want more time with you , Brontë . I want to learn about you , and you to learn about me . ”
46002	46018	46019	46019	He	818	“ How do I know that ’s not a line you tell all the girls ? ”
46030	46068	46069	46069	She	818	“ Call my assistant . She ’ll tell you how many women I ’ve dated in the last year . And then ask her how many women I asked to see again . The answer is none . ”
46072	46082	46069	46069	She	818	“ How would she know about your dating life ? ”
46083	46089	46090	46090	he	818	“ She schedules my reservations , ”
46102	46115	46116	46116	Brontë	112	“ She knows my personal business because it ’s her job to . ”
46132	46154	46116	46116	Brontë	112	“ Why me ? You can have anyone you want . Why waste your time with a waitress from Kansas City ? ”
46155	46165	46166	46166	he	818	“ Because you treat me like a regular guy , ”
46188	46261	46182	46182	she	112	“ Because you make me smile . Because you light up when you find a perfect quote for the situation , and I love to see that . Because you ’re smart and funny and down - to - earth , and that ’s a rare combination in a pretty woman . Because you thought I was no one , and you still took your top off to swim naked with me . ”
46269	46284	46182	46182	she	112	“ I was trying to have an island fling , thank you very much . ”
46285	46294	46295	46295	he	819	“ But now we ’re off the island , ”
46299	46310	46182	46182	she	112	“ And I ’m still interested in flinging with you . ”
46311	46361	46182	46182	she	112	“ Logan , I do n’t know . You ’re not the guy I thought you were . I was n’t intimidated when I thought you were some guy with a hundred grand a year salary . Now you ’re some guy with two hundred million dollars in businesses . ”
46362	46372	46373	46373	She	112	“ Actually , it ’s more like two billion . ”
46377	46380	46373	46373	She	112	“ Technically . ”
46381	46394	46395	46395	Her	112	“ And you bought this diner just to meet with me again ? ”
46402	46413	46414	46414	She	112	“ Do you want this place ? It ’s yours . ”
46425	46458	46414	46414	She	112	“ No , absolutely not . I do n’t want it . I do n’t want my friends to lose their jobs just because you want me to date you , though . ”
46459	46493	46494	46494	She	112	“ Your friends are safe . I do n’t plan on interfering with business . Improving it , yes . Shutting it down , no . I would n’t hurt you like that . ”
46500	46504	46494	46494	She	112	“ Thank you . ”
46536	46557	46526	46526	her	112	“ Do n’t thank me . It has nothing to do with your decision . I ’m not a monster . ”
46558	46583	46517	46517	she	112	“ So if I told you that I never wanted to see you again , you would n’t close the diner out of revenge ? ”
46584	46598	46599	46599	She	112	“ I would not . Even I can take a hint , Brontë . ”
46606	46618	46599	46599	She	112	“ You have n’t been very good at it so far . ”
46644	46669	46626	46626	He	820	“ I liked what we had before . I liked waking up with you beside me . I liked wrapping my arms around you . ”
46676	46687	46626	46626	He	820	“ I liked watching you play naked on the beach . ”
46688	46699	46626	46626	He	820	“ Boy , you sure are focused on the naked — ”
46700	46732	46736	46736	her	820	“ I also liked just talking with you , and laughing with you . Just being normal Logan with normal Brontë , having a dinner of M&M ’s and scavenged crackers . ”
46767	46786	46751	46751	he	820	“ Will you give me another chance , Brontë ? A chance to get to know you better ? ”
46791	46813	46814	46814	He	820	“ But I want things to be normal between us . No more buying companies just to get close to me . ”
46838	46847	46848	46848	She	820	“ No more buying companies . Got it . ”
46925	46930	46915	46915	she	820	“ Logan , I — ”
46960	46965	46966	46966	she	820	“ I missed you , ”
46973	46981	46966	46966	she	820	“ Wow , that just sounded stupid . ”
46982	46987	46988	46988	He	820	“ Not to me . ”
46996	47001	46988	46988	He	820	“ Was that Plato ? ”
47021	47028	47029	47029	She	820	“ You think everything is Plato . ”
47044	47070	47029	47029	She	820	“ So , um , do you live in Kansas City , too ? I thought the articles said you live in New York City . ”
47071	47075	47029	47029	She	820	“ I do . ”
47082	47093	47029	47029	She	820	“ Then how are we going to see each other ? ”
47094	47104	47105	47105	he	820	“ I thought you ’d come back with me , ”
47109	47124	47125	47125	Her	820	“ Stay with me for a few weeks . See if we still click . ”
47183	47190	47172	47172	she	820	“Say you ’ll come with me . ”
47191	47199	47213	47213	his	820	“ I do n’t know . I — ”
47247	47257	47241	47241	he	820	“ Say you ’ll come with me , Brontë . ”
47258	47261	47262	47262	Logan	175	“ I — ”
47274	47277	47278	47278	she	820	“ Okay , ”
47289	47312	47278	47278	she	820	“ You do n’t have to convince me again . This ’ll just be vacation two - point - oh or something . ”
47326	47344	47313	47313	Brontë	112	“ I do n’t suppose you have a nice , low - key little flat in Manhattan ? ”
47345	47359	47360	47360	She	820	“ I own several nice , low - key little high - rises . ”
47365	47377	47378	47378	He	820	“ Forget I asked . So when are we doing this ? ”
47385	47388	47378	47378	He	820	“ Now ? ”
47389	47402	47378	47378	He	820	“ Now ? Do n’t you have to interview the other employees ? ”
47403	47425	47426	47426	Brontë	112	“ The consultant’ll take care of that . I hired him for that reason . You and I have other plans . ”
47441	47457	47458	47458	He	820	“ You ’re not good at people telling you ‘ no , ’ are you ? ”
47472	47483	47484	47484	Her	820	“ I ’d rather hear you saying ‘ yes . ’ ”
47522	47534	47498	47498	she	820	“ I ’m definitely more of a ‘ yes ’ girl . ”
47535	47544	47545	47545	Logan	175	“ So this is a yes , then ? ”
47550	47557	47545	47545	Logan	175	“ Do you need more proof ? ”
47582	47622	47623	47623	His	820	“ I told you I like you . I ’m not exactly sure that we ’re a good fit , but I ’m willing to see where this goes . ‘ Fortune favors the bold ’ and all that . ”
47633	47644	47623	47623	His	820	“ I love it when you talk Plato to me . ”
47645	47652	47653	47653	Her	820	“ Virgil , baby . Virgil . ”
47658	47671	47672	47672	She	820	“ Mmm . I wish we were somewhere private right about now . ”
47688	47709	47710	47710	He	820	“ Come with me . I ’m wanting to test that ‘ fortune favoring the bold ’ thing right now . ”
47741	47746	47730	47730	he	820	“ Cold in here . ”
47747	47754	47755	47755	she	820	“ I ’ll warm you up , ”
47758	47762	47764	47764	she	820	“ Come here . ”
47800	47826	47788	47788	he	820	“ You sure you want to do this here , Brontë ? Once I start kissing you again , I ’m not going to stop . ”
47843	47855	47827	47827	She	820	“ Think anyone is going to follow us into the kitchen ? ”
47867	47875	47876	47876	Logan	175	“ Not if they value their jobs , ”
47879	47896	47876	47876	Logan	175	“ I made it quite clear to the consultant that we were not to be disturbed . ”
47897	47908	47909	47909	she	820	“ Then we do n’t have anything to worry about , ”
47944	47966	47935	47935	she	820	“ You do n’t have anything else to tell me , do you ? Secret marriage ? Bodies in the backyard ? ”
47967	47977	47978	47978	he	820	“ I ’m afraid that I am alarmingly dull , ”
47985	47998	47978	47978	he	820	“ No kids . No wives . No bodies in the backyard . ”
48029	48042	48043	48043	she	820	“ Seems like I ’m getting the raw end of this deal , ”
48052	48058	48043	48043	she	820	“ You sound terribly boring . ”
48059	48065	48066	48066	Logan	175	“ Terribly , terribly boring , ”
48125	48134	48135	48135	God	67	“ Your mouth makes my panties so wet . ”
48144	48148	48149	48149	he	175	“ Plato again ? ”
48154	48158	48159	48159	she	820	“ Brontë Dawson , ”
48163	48177	48159	48159	she	820	“ I hear she ’s got a thing for tall , dull guys . ”
48178	48190	48191	48191	He	175	“ It ’s a lucky day to be a dull guy . ”
48243	48252	48253	48253	He	175	“ I do n’t suppose you brought condoms ? ”
48262	48267	48253	48253	He	175	“ We ’re good . ”
48351	48376	48345	48345	Logan	175	“ We ’ll have to be quiet unless we want to broadcast to your coworkers exactly what you ’re doing with your new boss . ”
48377	48386	48387	48387	she	820	“ I ’m thinking they ’ve already guessed , ”
48403	48420	48387	48387	she	820	“ And I ’m thinking I do n’t care that much . I just want you . ”
48578	48585	48586	48586	he	175	“ I want you , Brontë , ”
48596	48604	48605	48605	she	820	“ I want you too , Logan , ”
48617	48623	48605	48605	she	820	“ Make love to me . ”
48895	48898	48899	48899	He	175	“ Please . ”
48932	48935	48936	48936	he	175	“ Brontë , ”
48957	48961	48936	48936	he	175	“ My Brontë . ”
48962	48965	48966	48966	she	820	“ Yours , ”
49017	49022	49023	49023	He	175	“ Yours , Logan . ”
49279	49290	49291	49291	she	820	“ Can I make a suggestion to my new manager ? ”
49300	49304	49291	49291	she	820	“ Ask away . ”
49305	49313	49314	49314	she	820	“ I recommend tossing out this food , ”
49317	49338	49339	49339	He	175	“ I do n’t know that I could serve it to anyone after knowing what we just did in here . ”
49342	49372	49339	49339	He	175	“ I ’ll take that into consideration . But you ’re not going to be here to serve it , Brontë . You ’re going to be with me . ”
49373	49407	49408	49408	He	175	“ I should n’t go with you , but I ’m going to anyhow . The others are going to talk a mile a minute if I leave with you for a week . ”
49437	49454	49432	49432	she	820	“ You can tell them you ’re doing training at my corporate office if anyone asks . ”
49455	49469	49470	49470	she	820	“ I ’m not sure they ’d approve of that kind of training , ”
49477	49487	49488	49488	Logan	175	“ They would n’t dare say anything to you , ”
49491	49495	49488	49488	Logan	175	“ Not if — ”
49496	49499	49500	49500	she	820	“ Logan , ”
49507	49525	49526	49526	he	175	“ You ’re going to the corporate office to represent your company for a few business meetings , ”
49537	49546	49526	49526	he	175	“ A few friendly , intimate business meetings . ”
49703	49714	49697	49698	The consultant	1804	“ The next employee on the list is Marj Davis . ”
49729	49751	49715	49715	Logan	175	“ I ’ve got another appointment to get to . I trust you ’ll be able to handle it from here ? ”
49802	49811	49812	49813	the consultant	1804	“ Everything ’s under control , Mr. Hawkings , ”
49816	49828	49812	49813	the consultant	1804	“ I ’ll send you my full report in the morning . ”
49829	49832	49833	49833	Logan	175	“ Excellent , ”
49862	49872	49847	49847	He	175	“ I ’ll be taking Miss Dawson with me . ”
49945	49948	49949	49949	she	179	“ Well , ”
49962	49979	49949	49949	she	179	“ That ’s going to make things awkward when I have to go back to work . ”
49995	50005	49980	49980	He	839	“ Should I have the consultant speak to them ? ”
50006	50011	50012	50012	God	67	“ What ? No ! ”
50024	50058	50012	50012	God	67	“ Let ’s just forget about it . I ’ll give it a few days to die down before I come back . I ’ll talk with the manager about clearing my schedule . ”
50059	50065	50066	50066	He	839	“ I ’m clearing it . ”
50093	50098	50085	50085	She	179	“ For how long ? ”
50099	50108	50109	50109	Her	179	“ Indefinitely . I want you with me . ”
50149	50161	50085	50085	She	179	“ And I ’ll have my job when I get back ? ”
50162	50166	50167	50167	he	839	“ You will , ”
50199	50209	50210	50210	she	179	“ A happy life consists in tranquillity of mind , ”
50283	50289	50271	50271	She	179	“ I drove myself here . ”
50305	50314	50298	50298	She	179	“ You want to drive to my apartment ? ”
50315	50318	50319	50319	He	175	“ No . ”
50330	50375	50376	50376	Her	179	“ I was n’t lying , Brontë . I do have a meeting I have to get to back in the city . We do n’t have time to go back to your apartment . I can have someone drive your car back safely . ”
50380	50401	50376	50376	Her	179	“ You want me to go with you ? Right now ? I do n’t have any of my stuff . ”
50421	50451	50412	50412	he	175	“ I need to go , but I ’m not letting you out of my sight again . So , yes , I want you to come with me . ”
50452	50458	50459	50459	she	179	“ I ’ll need clothes , ”
50463	50469	50474	50474	she	179	“ I have credit cards . ”
50494	50532	50486	50486	Brontë	112	“ So you ’re going to buy me a plane ticket , put me up in a hotel , buy me clothes , and pay me a salary , all so I can spend time with you ? ”
50533	50538	50474	50474	she	179	“ That ’s right . ”
50539	50554	50559	50559	her	179	“ That puts all the power in your hands , do n’t you think ? ”
50563	50577	50557	50557	he	175	“ I did n’t get where I am by letting others have control . ”
50591	50601	50557	50557	he	175	“ I do n’t like being a kept woman . ”
50602	50618	50619	50619	She	179	“ Think of them as necessary expenses for my new . . . philosophy consultant . ”
50657	50661	50662	50662	she	845	“ All right , ”
50673	50687	50662	50662	she	845	“ But if you start picking out my clothes , I ’m leaving . ”
50688	50700	50701	50701	Logan	175	“ I do n’t know a thing about women ’s sizes , ”
50709	50717	50718	50718	Brontë	112	“ You ’re safe on that count . ”
50768	50772	50758	50758	Logan	175	“ Where to ? ”
50785	50788	50773	50774	The driver	848	“ Airport . ”
50818	50826	50804	50804	He	848	“ Ever ridden on a private plane ? ”
50827	50834	50804	50804	He	848	“ Never . You have one ? ”
50835	50840	50804	50804	He	848	“ Two , actually . ”
50841	50844	50845	50845	she	845	“ Naturally , ”
50848	50865	50866	50866	He	848	“ Let me guess . Two , just in case the other needs an oil change ? ”
51028	51033	51034	51034	Logan	175	“ Have a seat , ”
51047	51066	51034	51034	Logan	175	“ If you ’re tired , you can take a nap in the bedroom after we take off . ”
51067	51070	51071	51071	She	845	“ Bedroom ? ”
51077	51086	51087	51087	He	175	“ You have a bedroom on this thing ? ”
51090	51104	51087	51087	He	175	“ Sometimes I have to take late flights . It makes things easier . ”
51144	51149	51150	51150	Brontë	112	“ We ’re here . ”
51163	51167	51150	51150	Brontë	112	“ We are ? ”
51168	51193	51196	51196	Brontë	112	“ Yes . We have just enough time to get you situated upstairs , and then I have to head off to my meeting . ”
51266	51276	51255	51255	Logan	175	“ Wait here . I wo n’t be long . ”
51300	51314	51282	51282	Logan	175	“ I ’ll show you my place , and you can get comfortable . ”
51315	51322	51323	51323	She	112	“ Do you have to go ? ”
51354	51372	51339	51339	Logan	175	“ It ’s a meeting I ’ve rescheduled twice already . I wo n’t reschedule it again . ”
51394	51407	51383	51383	Logan	175	“ When I get back , we can go out to dinner . ”
51507	51510	51500	51500	Logan	175	“ Uncomfortable ? ”
51511	51514	51515	51515	she	112	“ Nah , ”
51523	51551	51515	51515	she	112	“ Just thinking that everyone in this building pays more in rent per month than what I make all year . What would make a girl nervous ? ”
51552	51562	51563	51563	he	175	“ Do n’t worry about what other people think , ”
51576	51585	51563	51563	he	175	“ You ’re gorgeous just as you are . ”
51586	51593	51515	51515	she	112	“ Easy for you to say . ”
51594	51600	51563	51563	he	175	“ It is , yes . ”
51624	51640	51614	51614	She	112	“ It ’s just going to take a bit of getting used to for me . ”
51671	51677	51656	51656	Brontë	112	“ Is this your apartment ? ”
51678	51688	51689	51689	He	175	“ It ’s the only one on this floor . ”
51708	51719	51720	51720	He	175	“ You have an entire floor ? For one person ? ”
51723	51732	51720	51720	He	175	“ Would you prefer I had a studio ? ”
51733	51738	51739	51739	she	112	“ Studios are cozy , ”
51754	51774	51783	51783	he	175	“ I prefer more living space . A studio does n’t exactly set the right image for a billionaire . ”
52042	52049	52020	52020	She	112	“ This is where you live ? ”
52072	52082	52065	52065	he	175	“ When I ’m in the city , yes . ”
52110	52118	52119	52119	He	175	“ How many rooms is this place ? ”
52122	52134	52119	52119	He	175	“ I do n’t recall . Four guest bedrooms ? Five ? ”
52135	52138	52139	52139	she	112	“ Naturally , ”
52142	52152	52153	52153	Logan	175	“ Every bachelor needs at least five guest bedrooms . ”
52169	52174	52153	52153	Logan	175	“ Are you uncomfortable ? ”
52175	52181	52182	52182	she	112	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
52200	52208	52209	52209	He	175	“ How long will you be gone ? ”
52216	52256	52209	52209	He	175	“ Three hours , depending on traffic , of course . If you need anything , dial nine on the phone . That ’ll forward your call to my assistant , and she can get you anything you need . ”
52257	52260	52209	52209	He	175	“ Gotcha . ”
52261	52274	52275	52275	She	112	“ What do you want for dinner ? I ’ll make reservations . ”
52303	52307	52308	52308	He	175	“ You pick . ”
52320	52330	52331	52331	He	175	“ I should go so I ’m not late . ”
52338	52344	52345	52345	she	112	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
52353	52391	52345	52345	she	112	“ Seriously . It ’ll probably take me three hours to figure out how to work the remote on your TV . Or discover where the TV is . You ’ll be back before I know it . ”
52392	52400	52401	52401	he	175	“ If you need anything , call , ”
52411	52454	52345	52345	she	112	“ Or if you ’re thinking of me , call . Actually , think of me anyhow . I know I ’m not going to be able to take my mind off of you here in my home , waiting for me . ”
52543	52550	52536	52536	Logan	175	“ I ’ll be back soon . ”
52565	52571	52558	52558	she	112	“ I ’ll be here . ”
53098	53101	53102	53102	he	175	“ Tired ? ”
53109	53114	53115	53115	she	112	“ More like bored , ”
53122	53141	53115	53115	she	112	“ Did you know that you have six remotes ? And none of them turn on the TV ? ”
53142	53149	53150	53150	he	175	“ It ’s voice - activated , ”
53157	53167	53150	53150	he	175	“ I can show you how to use it . ”
53168	53188	53115	53115	she	112	“ I ’m afraid to touch it . Actually , I ’m afraid to touch most everything in here . ”
53189	53192	53115	53115	she	112	“ Why ? ”
53193	53202	53203	53203	He	175	“ It ’s expensive . All of it . ”
53206	53217	53203	53203	He	175	“ My home is your home while you ’re here . ”
53341	53350	53351	53351	She	112	“ Do you not want to be here ? ”
53367	53404	53405	53405	Logan	175	“ No , I want to be here . I think I ’d just feel better if this did n’t look like a museum . You need a puppy to dirty this place up or something . ”
53415	53420	53405	53405	Logan	175	“ I have you . ”
53421	53426	53427	53427	Her	112	“ Gee , thanks . ”
53453	53467	53438	53438	she	112	“ I ’m glad you ’re back . Did your meeting go well ? ”
53468	53472	53473	53473	he	175	“ Well enough , ”
53476	53498	53499	53499	She	112	“ We have a cocktail party to go to tomorrow night . I want you to meet some of my friends . ”
53505	53514	53499	53499	She	112	“ I do n’t have clothes for that . ”
53515	53530	53438	53438	she	112	“ Tell my assistant your size . She can pick out something for you . ”
53531	53544	53545	53545	He	175	“ I ’d like to buy my own clothing , thank you . ”
53556	53567	53568	53568	Brontë	112	“ I suppose you should change for dinner , too . ”
53571	53582	53568	53568	Brontë	112	“ Logan , I do n’t have anything to wear . ”
53583	53599	53600	53600	She	112	“ We can stop by a store and pick something up on the way out . ”
53641	53661	53662	53662	His	175	“ Ca n’t we just stay in bed tonight ? Surely you can get a pizza delivered or something . ”
53670	53673	53662	53662	His	175	“ Chinese ? ”
53674	53678	53679	53679	She	112	“ Sounds delicious . ”
53701	53708	53695	53695	Logan	175	“ I ’ll get my assistant — ”
53724	53751	53709	53709	She	112	“ Or we could just order it ourselves . You know , like normal people . You do n’t have to call your assistant for everything . ”
53752	53756	53757	53757	he	175	“ You win , ”
53767	53776	53757	53757	he	175	“ You order , and I ’ll pay ? ”
53777	53780	53782	53782	she	112	“ Deal . ”
53858	53865	53866	53866	She	112	“ Exactly how hungry are you ? ”
53876	53885	53866	53866	She	112	“ Mm , not so hungry just yet . ”
53886	53889	53890	53890	he	175	“ Good , ”
53922	53932	53913	53913	he	175	“ I thought about you through my entire meeting . ”
53933	53936	53937	53937	Her	112	“ Oh ? ”
53949	53974	53975	53975	Brontë	112	“ I liked the thought of you in my house , in my bed . Though , in my daydreams , you were naked . ”
53978	53989	53990	53990	He	175	“ In my daydreams , your library had real books . ”
54002	54019	54020	54020	She	112	“ If you want real books , buy some . Buy as many as you want . ”
54037	54052	54025	54026	This man	872	“ I did n’t come here to shop . I came here for you . ”
54053	54058	54059	54059	he	872	“ So you did , ”
54094	54104	54077	54077	He	872	“ I find that very . . . arousing . ”
54105	54113	54114	54114	she	112	“ I find your touch very arousing , ”
54136	54146	54125	54125	She	112	“ Though you ’re wearing entirely too much clothing . ”
54175	54184	54185	54185	he	175	“ I could say the same of you , ”
54388	54395	54396	54396	she	112	“ I want you , Logan , ”
54399	54409	54410	54410	His	175	“ I need to feel your skin against mine . ”
54417	54421	54410	54410	His	175	“ You first . ”
54447	54454	54438	54438	He	175	“ I think you forgot something . ”
54455	54475	54476	54476	He	175	“ I had a rendezvous with my lover in a freezer earlier , and I had to discard them . ”
54482	54486	54476	54476	He	175	“ Lucky man . ”
54494	54498	54499	54499	she	112	“ He is , ”
54533	54544	54545	54545	Logan	175	“ He ’s also still wearing entirely too much clothing . ”
54599	54609	54596	54596	she	112	“ I want you naked on top of me , ”
54725	54737	54738	54738	He	175	“ ‘ Short is the joy that guilty pleasure brings . ’ ”
54748	54758	54738	54738	He	175	“ Are you using Plato to criticize my techniques ? ”
54771	54785	54759	54759	Brontë	112	“ Not at all . Just sad that it did n’t last longer . ”
54794	54804	54786	54786	She	112	“ And I ’m pretty sure that was Euripides . ”
54805	54812	54817	54817	She	112	“ Ah . Good old Euripides . ”
54813	54816	54817	54817	She	112	“ Mmmm . ”
54825	54835	54836	54836	He	175	“ You are still wearing entirely too much clothing . ”
54882	54893	54875	54875	She	112	“ Now I have you right where I want you . ”
54915	54922	54923	54923	Logan	175	“ And I want you naked . ”
54941	54952	54923	54923	Logan	175	“ I think I like you on top of me . ”
54953	54959	54960	54960	She	112	“ Do you , now ? ”
55038	55045	55030	55030	he	175	“ I love looking at you . ”
55046	55051	55052	55052	he	175	“ It ’s mutual , ”
55081	55085	55066	55066	She	112	“ Clothes off . ”
55152	55163	55139	55139	Brontë	112	“ Now we need to get rid of these pants . ”
55234	55240	55241	55241	he	175	“ I like you there , ”
55304	55309	55310	55310	she	112	“ You ’re right , ”
55313	55319	55310	55310	she	112	“ This definitely has merit . ”
55320	55326	55327	55327	he	175	“ We need a condom , ”
55335	55340	55327	55327	he	175	“ In the nightstand . ”
55381	55388	55370	55370	She	112	“ Shall I do the honors ? ”
55389	55393	55394	55394	he	175	“ Please do , ”
55461	55464	55465	55465	he	175	“ Tease , ”
55468	55474	55475	55475	she	112	“ You like being teased , ”
55812	55815	55816	55816	he	175	“ Brontë , ”
55940	55957	55930	55930	Logan	175	“ Why do n’t you jump in the shower , and I ’ll order the food ? ”
55958	55969	55970	55970	They	902	“ You know how to sweet - talk a girl . ”
56129	56149	56116	56116	He	175	“ I have meetings all day , but I ’ll be back in time to pick you up tonight . ”
56150	56168	56169	56169	Logan	175	“ Gotcha . Is there a bookstore nearby I can hit up once I find some pants ? ”
56172	56189	56169	56169	Logan	175	“ You have all of New York at your disposal , and you want a bookstore ? ”
56190	56194	56195	56195	She	112	“ Pretty much . ”
56203	56211	56212	56212	He	175	“ But it comes second to pants . ”
56220	56248	56249	56249	She	112	“ Tell you what . I ’ll send my assistant over in about an hour with some clothes for you . She can escort you around town . ”
56272	56276	56277	56277	She	112	“ All right . ”
56297	56309	56277	56277	She	112	“ You ’re going to think about me today , right ? ”
56325	56334	56310	56310	Logan	175	“ I could n’t stop if I tried . ”
56335	56350	56313	56313	his	175	“ A wise man once said , ‘ We strive after the forbidden . ’ ”
56351	56355	56356	56356	She	112	“ More Plato ? ”
56361	56372	56356	56356	She	112	“ Everyone ’s Plato to you . That was Ovid . ”
56373	56391	56392	56392	Logan	175	“ If you find a bookstore , buy me some Plato . I hear he ’s interesting . ”
56407	56419	56428	56428	she	112	“ I ’ll call when I ’m on my way home . ”
56586	56589	56574	56574	She	112	“ Coming . ”
56699	56706	56687	56687	She	909	“ You must be Brontë Dawson . ”
56713	56742	56707	56707	She	909	“ My name is Audrey Petty , and I ’m Logan ’s assistant . He asked me to come by and see if I could help out today . ”
56749	56761	56743	56743	Brontë	112	“ Hi there . Yes . I ’m Logan ’s girlfriend . ”
56779	56809	56771	56771	Her	909	“ Well , Logan told me to come by with some clothes so you could go shopping today . It seems he did n’t give you time to pack ? ”
56810	56815	56816	56816	Brontë	112	“ That ’s right . ”
56829	56836	56837	56837	She	909	“ Sorry to be such trouble . ”
56844	56883	56837	56837	She	909	“ Trouble ? Logan once asked me to drive to Pennsylvania to pick up floor plans because he did n’t like the way they looked faxed . Taking someone shopping ? That is not trouble in the slightest . ”
56910	56920	56893	56893	Audrey	244	“ Does Logan often make you run strange errands ? ”
56921	56931	56932	56932	Audrey	244	“ I do n’t know if they ’re strange , ”
56935	56968	56969	56969	Brontë	112	“ But he does sometimes ask me to run favors for him . It ’s my job as his assistant , of course . He has a secretary for other business needs . ”
56972	56984	56969	56969	Brontë	112	“ So wait . He has an assistant and a secretary ? ”
56994	57064	56985	56985	Audrey	244	“ Of course . Now , Logan told me that he had no idea what your size was , so I bought a sweater and some pants in every size . We can just return the ones that do n’t fit . I also brought some panties and bras in some common sizes . If you do n’t have shoes , I can go back out and get some . ”
57065	57070	57071	57071	Brontë	112	“ This is fine , ”
57094	57118	56985	56985	Audrey	244	“ This is nicer than what I normally wear , actually . You could have brought me a T - shirt and jeans . ”
57119	57129	57130	57130	Audrey	244	“ Not if I wanted to keep my job , ”
57134	57156	57157	57157	He	910	“ I know Logan , and if he thought I was cheaping out on you , he ’d have my head . ”
57188	57193	57171	57171	She	244	“ These ’ll work . ”
57194	57226	57227	57227	She	244	“ Super . You go change and I ’ll pack everything else up , and then we can get started . We ’ve got a lot of shopping ahead of us . ”
57234	57238	57227	57227	She	244	“ We do ? ”
57239	57249	57250	57250	she	244	“ Logan ’s instructions are , and I quote , ”
57263	57291	57292	57292	She	244	“ ‘ Make sure that she gets a few weeks ’ worth of clothing , along with some evening wear . You know my events calendar . ’ ”
57299	57309	57292	57292	She	244	“ I do , and it ’s a doozy . ”
57320	57339	57340	57340	She	244	“ ‘ Also , take her to the best bookstore in Manhattan . My library needs restocking . ’ ”
57348	57354	57340	57340	She	244	“ He has a library ? ”
57355	57359	57360	57360	Brontë	112	“ Not really , ”
57377	57394	57360	57360	Brontë	112	“ And I really do n’t need that many clothes . Just a change or two . ”
57404	57418	57395	57395	Audrey	244	“ I have my orders , and I ’m afraid they trump yours . ”
57484	57497	57498	57498	Audrey	244	“ Thanks for the clothes . How much do I owe you ? ”
57504	57508	57498	57498	Audrey	244	“ Very funny . ”
57509	57517	57518	57520	The other woman	244	“ I can write you a check . ”
57525	57559	57560	57560	Brontë	112	“ Are you or are you not aware that you ’re dating a billionaire ? He has a little cash to throw around . This is coming from his wallet , not mine . ”
57563	57597	57598	57598	Audrey	244	“ Just because he has the cash does n’t mean that I want him to spend ridiculous amounts on me . I ’m a grown woman . I can buy my own clothes . ”
57612	57633	57609	57609	she	244	“ Well , that ’s something I do n’t hear very often from women in Logan ’s circles . Huh . ”
57647	57687	57634	57634	She	244	“ Anyhow . Today , the shopping is on Logan . You can argue with him when he gets home . As long as you ’re with me , though , his card is the one we ’re using . ”
57714	57723	57691	57691	She	244	“ Sounds good . Where are we heading ? ”
57724	57731	57732	57732	Audrey	244	“ Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue , ”
57736	57751	57732	57732	Audrey	244	“ That ’s where the best shopping is . Do you have a preference ? ”
57752	57760	57761	57761	Audrey	244	“ Someplace with reasonable , comfortable clothing ? ”
57769	57829	57830	57830	Brontë	112	“ Oh , honey . No . We ’ll start with your dress for the party tonight . I ’m thinking Bergdorf ’s or Saks . And shoes . We ’ll definitely need some shoes . This could get a little pricey , so I just want you to close your eyes and remember who ’s buying , okay ? ”
57835	57862	57830	57830	Brontë	112	“ Audrey , this makes me . . . really uncomfortable . I do n’t know that I can spend someone else ’s money like this . ”
57863	57870	57871	57871	she	244	“ I know you ca n’t , ”
57878	57912	57871	57871	she	244	“ That ’s why I ’m in charge . And may I just say that this is a refreshing change ? Usually I have to pry his girlfriends away from the Centurion card . ”
57913	57926	57830	57830	Brontë	112	“ I thought he had n’t dated much in the past year ? ”
57927	57940	57941	57941	Audrey	244	“ He has n’t . I ’ve been with him for several . ”
57950	57955	57956	57956	They	914	“ Shall we go ? ”
58217	58222	58223	58223	Danica	51	“ Especially after Danica . ”
58236	58241	58225	58225	Brontë	112	“ Who ’s Danica ? ”
58251	58304	58305	58305	Brontë	112	“ I should n’t have said anything . Except . . . the party tonight ? You ’re going to be there , and the other guests on the list ? They all know about Danica , and someone ’s sure to bring it up even if she does n’t show up . ”
58313	58318	58319	58320	The assistant	929	“ Who ’s Danica ? ”
58323	58352	58319	58320	The assistant	929	“ I really should n’t tell you . My number one loyalty is to Logan , and this feels disloyal . It ’s not my place to speculate — ”
58353	58356	58357	58357	Brontë	112	“ Audrey , ”
58360	58375	58376	58378	The other woman	1563	“ Who is Danica , and why do I need to know about her ? ”
58393	58404	58390	58390	she	1563	“ Danica is Logan ’s fiancée . Ex - fiancée . ”
58420	58430	58414	58414	He	929	“ Exactly how ex of a fiancée is she ? ”
58431	58450	58451	58451	Her	1563	“ They broke things off about two years ago . He has n’t really dated anyone seriously since . ”
58489	58496	58497	58497	Audrey	244	“ Why did they break up ? ”
58500	58568	58569	58569	She	1563	“ I ca n’t speculate . That ’s Logan ’s business and not something he shared with me . But I do know it was ugly . They ’re not speaking . That ’s why you have to look stellar at this party tonight . Odds are that she ’s going to be there , and you ca n’t give her any reason to pick you apart . ”
58573	58602	58569	58569	She	1563	“ I ’m a waitress . I ’m dating a billionaire . You do n’t think that ’s reason enough for her to want to tear me apart ? ”
58603	58618	58569	58569	She	1563	“ It is . You just do n’t want to give her any more . ”
58619	58631	58632	58632	Audrey	244	“ ‘ The wise learn many things from their enemies . ’ ”
58639	58642	58632	58632	Audrey	244	“ Huh ? ”
58643	58653	58654	58654	Audrey	244	“ Oh . Um . Aristophanes . Never mind . ”
58663	58685	58686	58687	The assistant	929	“ We can start here . They have some really nice selections . Sophisticated and moneyed . Nothing that screams streetwalker . ”
58698	58743	58686	58687	The assistant	929	“ Not that I think you would have trouble with that , but you never know . Some women think that if they ’re spending a lot , the clothes should have a lot of flash . It ’s just the opposite , really . ”
58744	58752	58753	58753	Brontë	112	“ I ’ll keep that in mind , ”
58935	58970	58924	58925	The assistant	929	“ You have such lovely dark hair and pale skin that I think you could probably look great in a nice jewel tone . Maybe blue ? Green ? Do you have a preference ? ”
58981	58986	58987	58987	Brontë	112	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
58996	59008	59009	59009	Audrey	244	“ I really do n’t feel comfortable with the prices here . ”
59016	59025	59026	59026	She	244	“ Are you still going on about this ? ”
59043	59142	59143	59143	Brontë	112	“ You are dating a billionaire . Wearing T - shirts and jeans is fine for at home , if that ’s your thing . But if you go out ? People are going to look at what he ’s wearing , and they ’re going to look at what you ’re wearing . You have to convey an image . The functions that Logan attends ? They frequently make the society pages . The last thing you want is for someone to point out fabulously wealthy and handsome Logan Hawkings and his thrift store girlfriend . Understand ? ”
59154	59223	59147	59147	Audrey	244	“ Do I need to call Logan ? Because if we do n’t get you outfitted appropriately , I ’m the one who ’s going to be in trouble , Brontë . As his assistant , it ’s my job to make him look good . And if you look good , he looks good . And I really like my job and would hate to lose it . ”
59224	59231	59295	59295	Brontë	112	“ That is totally emotional blackmail . ”
59232	59238	59239	59239	Audrey	244	“ Yes , it is . ”
59255	59262	59239	59239	Audrey	244	“ Now , green or blue ? ”
59836	59843	59844	59844	She	244	“ You look gorgeous , Brontë . ”
59849	59857	59844	59844	She	244	“ I look expensive , you mean . ”
59858	59871	59876	59876	his	175	“ You do , but it ’s perfect for the party tonight . ”
59889	59894	59895	59895	Brontë	112	“ You ’re perfect . ”
59925	59938	59939	59939	she	244	“ I did n’t know you were going to work so late , ”
59961	59994	59951	59951	He	713	“ Note my apology . I had a few meetings that ran late . If I ’d have known you were so incredibly gorgeous while waiting for me , though . . . ”
60014	60020	60021	60021	She	244	“ I like this part . ”
60032	60040	60021	60021	She	244	“ What time does the party start ? ”
60041	60048	60049	60049	Her	244	“ About a half hour ago . ”
60061	60077	60054	60054	she	244	“ So we ’re late ? Please tell me this is n’t a dinner party . ”
60088	60093	60094	60094	he	713	“ Just a mixer , ”
60100	60113	60094	60094	he	713	“ Some close friends and business associates . Nothing to worry about . ”
60127	60130	60125	60131	The whole “ business associates ” part	950	“ business associates ”
60150	60158	60144	60144	he	713	“ I think your dress needs something . ”
60159	60163	60164	60164	She	244	“ Does it ? ”
60187	60197	60198	60198	He	713	“ I thought I looked pretty good , myself . ”
60220	60227	60228	60228	Brontë	112	“ See if you like this . ”
60240	60261	60228	60228	Brontë	112	“ Oh , Logan . You should n’t have . Really . Whatever you spent , it ’s too much . ”
60262	60267	60268	60268	he	713	“ Look at it , ”
60277	60305	60268	60268	he	713	“ I tried to find one like in the gift shop . Now that you know that I have money , I can give you these things . ”
60403	60412	60389	60389	She	244	“ I ca n’t take this , Logan . ”
60413	60430	60389	60389	She	244	“ I want you to wear it , Brontë . You ’ll look beautiful in it . ”
60431	60467	60472	60472	he	713	“ It ’s too much . I ’m already wearing stuff that ’s way more expensive than it should be . You ’re spending too much money , Logan . I do n’t like it . ”
60484	60488	60489	60489	She	244	“ Turn around . ”
60515	60523	60502	60502	Logan	175	“ Do you always get your way ? ”
60524	60527	60528	60528	he	713	“ Always , ”
60536	60540	60541	60541	She	244	“ Turn around . ”
60566	60573	60552	60552	he	713	“ Thank you , I think . ”
60574	60579	60580	60580	He	713	“ You ’re welcome . ”
60589	60593	60580	60580	He	713	“ I think . ”
60748	60754	60755	60755	Logan	175	“ Are you all right ? ”
60819	60824	60825	60825	Brontë	112	“ I ’m okay , ”
60829	60833	60825	60825	Brontë	112	“ Just nervous . ”
60834	60838	60839	60839	She	112	“ I know . ”
60844	60850	60839	60839	She	112	“ How do you know ? ”
60851	60865	60866	60866	His	175	“ You have this strange giggle that you do when you ’re nervous . ”
60875	60889	60866	60866	His	175	“ That , and you ’ve got a death grip on my sleeve . ”
60898	60901	60890	60890	She	112	“ Sorry . ”
60902	60907	60908	60908	He	175	“ Do n’t be . ”
60939	60972	60920	60920	His	175	“ You look utterly delectable . If we were n’t heading to this party , I might be convinced to stop this elevator and see what you ’re wearing under that dress . ”
60973	60982	60983	60983	she	112	“ I ’ll spoil the suspense for you , ”
60987	60990	60991	60991	He	175	“ Nothing . ”
61001	61008	60991	60991	He	175	“ No tan lines , either ? ”
61009	61022	61023	61023	She	112	“ Nope . I spent my day at the beach totally nude . ”
61033	61043	61023	61023	She	112	“ I had good company , if I recall . ”
61044	61048	61049	61049	He	175	“ The best . ”
61116	61120	61121	61121	he	175	“ Very funny , ”
61252	61265	61243	61243	Brontë	112	“ Come on . We should go say hello to our host . ”
61378	61387	61373	61373	She	112	“ Not even the gods fight against necessity . ”
61434	61437	61438	61438	Logan	175	“ Brontë , ”
61441	61461	61438	61438	Logan	175	“ I want you to meet my newest business partner , Doyle Bullet , and his wife , Rita . ”
61494	61506	61488	61488	She	423	“ Pleased to meet you both . I ’m Brontë Dawson . ”
61514	61528	61507	61507	Rita	365	“ How lovely to meet you . Such an unusual name , too . ”
61529	61533	61534	61534	she	365	“ Thank you , ”
61548	61574	61539	61539	Rita	365	“ It ’s not after any Brontë in particular . Or rather , any or all of them . Pick a Brontë , any Brontë . ”
61612	61620	61621	61621	Logan	175	“ Thank you for inviting us tonight , ”
61625	61638	61621	61621	Logan	175	“ And for letting me bring a friend on such late notice . ”
61639	61644	61645	61645	Rita	365	“ But of course , ”
61657	61677	61678	61678	She	365	“ Would you excuse me ? I just want to make sure that the caterers have everything under control . ”
61694	61715	61689	61689	Doyle	119	“ Do n’t suppose that you saw what the Dow closed at today ? It was a bloodbath in there . ”
61716	61724	61725	61725	Logan	175	“ I was in meetings all afternoon . ”
61740	61744	61725	61725	Logan	175	“ What happened ? ”
61745	61756	61757	61757	Doyle	119	“ News report about more banking scandals , of course , ”
61768	61778	61763	61763	He	119	“ Do you dabble in investments , my dear ? ”
61801	61812	61813	61813	He	119	“ No , I do n’t . I ’m sorry . ”
61820	61842	61813	61813	He	119	“ Well , you should consider it . You ’ll never make any money if you do n’t risk any money . ”
61843	61847	61848	61848	she	365	“ Of course , ”
61860	61873	61874	61875	A man	1554	“ Logan , you old dog . When did you get back ? ”
61910	61913	61914	61914	he	973	“ Cade , ”
61922	61938	61914	61914	he	973	“ I ’d like you to meet my date . Brontë , this is Cade . ”
61939	61945	61946	61946	she	365	“ Pleased to meet you , ”
61953	61963	61964	61964	Logan	175	“ Cade is also a business partner of mine , ”
61968	61977	61978	61978	Cade	49	“ I prefer the term ‘ friend , ’ ”
61984	61992	61993	61993	She	365	“ You know , like regular people . ”
62005	62015	62016	62016	Doyle	119	“ As I was saying , Logan . . . ”
62024	62040	62016	62016	Doyle	119	“ I wanted to talk to you a bit more about the meeting this afternoon . ”
62041	62045	62046	62046	Logan	175	“ Of course , ”
62054	62076	62046	62046	Logan	175	“ Would you mind introducing Brontë to a few people ? I ’m sure this wo n’t be interesting for her . ”
62077	62083	62084	62084	Cade	49	“ I would be delighted , ”
62092	62096	62084	62084	Cade	49	“ Shall we ? ”
62097	62100	62101	62101	she	365	“ Sure , ”
62184	62191	62176	62176	Logan	175	“ How do you know Logan ? ”
62192	62198	62199	62199	Cade	49	“ We go way back , ”
62203	62219	62220	62220	She	365	“ College . Dartmouth . We studied business there together . Same frat and everything . ”
62226	62241	62220	62220	She	365	“ Same frat ? Logan does n’t strike me as the party boy type . ”
62242	62290	62291	62291	She	365	“ He ’s not . Even back then , he ’d glare at us over our drinks and remind us that we had a test in the morning . He ’s always been excessively responsible , I ’m afraid . He tries to keep everyone in line . ”
62294	62300	62291	62291	She	365	“ That sounds like Logan . ”
62301	62309	62310	62310	he	976	“ So how do you know Logan ? ”
62314	62335	62291	62291	She	365	“ It ’s been a long time since he ’s brought a date to one of these sorts of things . ”
62336	62358	62364	62364	she	365	“ We met under inauspicious circumstances , I ’m afraid . Did you hear about his trip to Seaturtle Cay resort ? ”
62438	62459	62460	62460	Brontë	112	“ I suppose we can credit Hurricane Latonya for bringing you both together , then . Logan seems happy enough . ”
62471	62475	62460	62460	Brontë	112	“ Does he ? ”
62476	62479	62480	62480	Cade	49	“ Indeed . ”
62484	62520	62480	62480	Cade	49	“ From what I ’ve heard , he has n’t been at work nearly as much since returning , and we were speculating as to why . It seems I ’ve found out the answer . ”
62521	62524	62525	62525	she	365	“ We ? ”
62532	62537	62525	62525	she	365	“ Who is we ? ”
62538	62552	62480	62480	Cade	49	“ Logan ’s closest friends . Would you like to meet a few ? ”
62553	62556	62557	62557	She	365	“ Please . ”
62561	62611	62612	62612	She	365	“ Hunter ’s not here tonight . He never attends these sorts of functions . But he and Logan are very close . I ’m sure you ’ll meet him at some point . Griffin ’s over there , by the ice sculpture . The one with the glasses . ”
62663	62671	62672	62672	she	365	“ He seems . . . nice , ”
62675	62685	62686	62686	Cade	49	“ Oh , Griffin ? He ’s a snob , ”
62690	62735	62686	62686	Cade	49	“ His family ’s British aristocracy . Very old money . Grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth and a polo pony at the ready . He ’s extremely intelligent . Good guy , once you get to know him , though . ”
62736	62741	62742	62742	she	365	“ I ’m sure , ”
62749	62813	62814	62814	She	365	“ He does n’t take kindly to strangers , though , which is why we ’re standing over here talking about him instead of introducing you . If you were on a committee or wanted to discuss funding for a university project , I imagine he ’d talk your ear off . Most of us run in fairly exclusive circles , you understand . ”
62851	62873	62845	62845	she	365	“ Reese is also here tonight . See the man to Griffin ’s left with the women hanging off of him ? ”
62958	62965	62948	62948	She	112	“ I think I found him . ”
62966	63005	62948	62948	She	112	“ Reese is a bit of a ladies ’ man , which is why we ’re standing way over here . If I take you over to Reese , Logan will probably charge over to protect his territory . ”
63024	63057	63058	63058	He	990	“ And you ? Where do you fit into the picture ? You ’ve shown me the professor and the playboy . Where do you fit into all these neat little categories ? ”
63067	63131	63132	63132	She	112	“ I am a Lancelot at heart , I ’m afraid . I like nothing more than to be of service . You ’re looking at the world ’s largest Boy Scout . Show me an old lady who needs to cross the street , and I ’ll show you a man who will trip over his own two feet to assist her . ”
63139	63151	63152	63152	Cade	49	“ That ’s a rather interesting picture you paint of yourself . ”
63155	63171	63152	63152	Cade	49	“ I find that most people fit into basic archetypes if you think about it . ”
63172	63181	63152	63152	Cade	49	“ Oh ? Where do you see me ? ”
63182	63192	63193	63193	He	49	“ I do n’t know enough about you yet . ”
63200	63209	63193	63193	He	49	“ What do you do for a living ? ”
63229	63240	63218	63218	She	112	“ I ’m a waitress . Does that change things ? ”
63249	63271	63246	63246	he	49	“ I ’m still forming my opinion . You ’re definitely more of a Mary Ann than a Ginger , though . ”
63272	63291	63218	63218	She	112	“ Ca n’t argue with that . Unfortunately , it feels like this party is full of Gingers . ”
63292	63304	63305	63305	he	49	“ These sorts of shindigs always draw a lot of Gingers , ”
63309	63329	63330	63330	He	49	“ Luckily for me , I ’ve claimed the one Mary Ann in the bunch . Much better conversation . ”
63375	63383	63384	63384	Cade	49	“ And Logan ? What is he ? ”
63387	63404	63384	63384	Cade	49	“ He ’s the boss , of course . Just like everyone wishes they could be . ”
63405	63422	63423	63423	He	49	“ Mmm . ‘ He who owns a hundred sheep must fight with fifty wolves . ’ ”
63430	63435	63423	63423	He	49	“ Who said that ? ”
63457	63460	63461	63461	he	49	“ Plutarch , ”
63469	63502	63503	63503	She	112	“ And you ’re keeping Logan ’s new friend all to yourself tonight . I ’m wounded , especially when I come and find that she ’s quoting Greek philosophy to you . ”
63511	63516	63503	63503	She	112	“ I ’m Brontë . ”
63517	63523	63524	63524	Griffin	47	“ Of course you are , ”
63550	63558	63533	63533	He	47	“ Anne , Charlotte , or Emily ? ”
63559	63564	63565	63565	she	112	“ Take your pick , ”
63597	63609	63610	63610	Cade	49	“ I ’m chaperoning while Logan has to do the rounds , ”
63613	63638	63610	63610	Cade	49	“ Brontë did n’t look as if she was enjoying the stock market conversation , so I was put in charge of her rescue . ”
63639	63643	63644	63644	Griffin	47	“ Wise choice , ”
63647	63662	63644	63644	Griffin	47	“ So you quoted Plutarch . Are you a big fan of his work ? ”
63663	63681	63682	63682	she	112	“ Actually , I do n’t know that I am . While I enjoyed his Parallel Lives , ”
63694	63722	63723	63723	Cade	49	“ I find them rather biased toward his own particular philosophy , which is ironic considering that he castigated Herodotus for doing the same in his works . ”
63726	63764	63723	63723	Cade	49	“ And this is the part where both of you lose me . I think I ’m off to get a refill while you two discuss dead Greek guys . Would you like more wine , Brontë ? ”
63765	63768	63769	63769	she	112	“ Please , ”
63776	63782	63783	63783	Griffin	47	“ That would be lovely . ”
63793	63840	63783	63783	Griffin	47	“ So how did Logan end up with a woman who quotes philosophy ? You ’ll forgive me if I say that most women he dates do n’t seem the type to be able to read anything beyond a fashion magazine , much less ancient history . ”
63841	63844	63845	63845	she	112	“ Well , ”
63852	63864	63845	63845	she	112	“ We got stuck in an elevator together in a hurricane . ”
64116	64120	64104	64104	He	49	“ next time , ”
64270	64276	64266	64266	she	112	“ Well , hello there , ”
64374	64400	64362	64362	She	112	“ I was wondering if I ’d get a chance to talk to you . They ’re keeping you well guarded , are n’t they ? ”
64405	64414	64415	64416	The woman	365	“ What do you mean , well guarded ? ”
64421	64461	64415	64416	The woman	365	“ His little friends . The band of billionaires or whatever they call themselves . Logan wants to make sure that you avoid people like me at this party , so he ’s assigned his buddies to shadow you . ”
64475	64489	64465	64465	Brontë	112	“ You must be Danica . I was told you ’d be here . ”
64498	64507	64490	64491	The woman	365	“ Not told by Logan , I imagine . ”
64519	64525	64526	64526	Brontë	112	“ Nice necklace . Present ? ”
64535	64623	64530	64530	Danica	51	“ Did he tell you that we were engaged ? My guess is no . He ’s very closed off emotionally . I suppose you can blame his father for that . The elder Mr. Hawkings was a real asshole , but at some point , Logan has to take responsibility for himself . Not everything in life is a business transaction . Of course , Logan has n’t learned that lesson yet . He thinks everything has a price . The old man taught him that . ”
64695	64709	64682	64683	The woman	112	“ I take it that you and Logan are not on friendly terms ? ”
64714	64738	64710	64710	Danica	51	“ I wanted to be on friendly terms . Our breaking up was not my choice , you know . He dumped me . ”
64739	64742	64682	64683	The woman	112	“ Why ? ”
64772	64825	64826	64826	She	112	“ Logan likes for everyone to stay in the neat little box he ’s created for them . If you try to escape the box , he ’ll try to push you back into it . And if that does n’t work , he ’s done with you . He ’s ruthless . ”
64841	64897	64898	64898	She	112	“ He wanted me to be the perfect little stay - at - home wifey . My schedule did n’t matter as long as I was available for him . And when I tried to have a life outside of him , or to assert my freedom , he cut me off at the knees . ”
64901	64942	64898	64898	She	112	“ The next thing I knew , I was being removed from the apartment we shared and all of my belongings were put into storage . He did n’t even give me a warning before tossing me into the trash . ”
64975	64983	64965	64965	Danica	51	“ Why are you telling me this ? ”
64996	65021	64984	64984	Danica	51	“ Because you look like a nice girl . And you ’re out of your depth with Logan . You ’re just his type . ”
65022	65026	64965	64965	Danica	51	“ I am ? ”
65027	65186	65187	65187	Brontë	112	“ Of course . You look soft and just a little bit shy . Intimidated . That ’s the kind Logan likes , you know . He plucks a girl out of nowhere and molds her into the woman he wants at his side . If you do n’t have a life , that makes it perfect for him , because he needs you available at his beck and call . He ’s a great guy . . . for a time . He ’ll make you the happiest woman on earth until you cross him . And if you try to be independent , be ready for him to send you packing . I do n’t want you to be caught off guard like I was . I thought I loved him and he loved me . It turns out that he does n’t know how to love . He just knows how to succeed at business . ”
65248	65255	65256	65256	Brontë	112	“ Logan ’s not like that , ”
65259	65272	65273	65273	Brontë	112	“ Is n’t he ? Have you told him you love him ? ”
65277	65296	65297	65297	She	244	“ Try it . See how he responds . That ’ll tell you everything you need to know . ”
65307	65334	65297	65297	She	244	“ I did , and he totally ignored me . Logan does n’t know how to love . All he knows is how to make money . ”
65335	65341	65342	65342	she	244	“ Thanks for the warning , ”
65346	65373	65342	65342	she	244	“ I ’m sorry I had to be the bearer of bad news . But it ’s best if you ’re prepared for the eventual heartbreak . ”
65383	65398	65399	65399	She	244	“ And if anyone asks , we did n’t have this conversation , understand ? ”
65806	65813	65792	65792	she	1976	“ It ’s cold out here . ”
65814	65820	65821	65821	she	1976	“ I had n’t noticed , ”
65837	65843	65825	65825	He	175	“ Is everything all right ? ”
65850	65881	65844	65844	She	1976	“ Yes . It just got to be a bit too much , and I drank more than I should have . I thought this would help clear my head . ”
65899	65918	65919	65919	She	1976	“ Would you like to go home ? I ’d love to peel this dress off of you . ”
65931	65938	65919	65919	She	1976	“ That sounds good to me . ”
65939	65966	65967	65967	She	1976	“ If there were n’t two hundred people in the other room , I ’d bend you over the balcony and make you mine right now . ”
65996	65999	65993	65993	her	1976	“ Logan . ”
66000	66056	66057	66057	She	1976	“ You ’re lovely in that dress , Brontë , but I ca n’t wait to see you out of it . Every man here is jealous that you ’re going home with me tonight . Your smile and your laugh are so charming that half the room turned around every time they heard you . ”
66064	66072	66057	66057	She	1976	“ I think that ’s your imagination . ”
66073	66090	66091	66091	Her	1976	“ It ’s true . Why do you think I asked Cade to keep you company ? ”
66106	66119	66104	66104	they	1018	“ I suppose . Let ’s go home . I ’m tired . ”
66176	66183	66184	66184	he	175	“ Did you enjoy the party ? ”
66212	66217	66218	66218	He	175	“ I met Danica . ”
66223	66226	66218	66218	He	175	“ Oh ? ”
66227	66244	66245	66245	He	175	“ She wanted to warn me about you . And how you treat everything like business . ”
66257	66270	66251	66251	Brontë	112	“ When were you going to tell me you had been engaged ? ”
66271	66302	66303	66303	He	175	“ I did n’t think it was important . We were only engaged for a day or two . Never set a date . It was over two years ago . ”
66310	66320	66303	66303	He	175	“ Apparently she ’s still quite upset over it . ”
66321	66348	66349	66349	He	175	“ She tried to warn me off of you . Said you ’d dump me like so much trash the moment you got tired of me . ”
66383	66393	66367	66367	she	112	“ You know that ’s not true , Brontë . ”
66394	66409	66410	66410	she	112	“ I suspect she told me a lot of things that were n’t true , ”
66459	66467	66453	66453	her	112	“ Why did you two break up ? ”
66468	66508	66509	66509	Brontë	112	“ I had my suspicions that Danica was with me for my money and not for me . I asked her to sign a prenuptial agreement . She refused , and that told me everything I needed to know . ”
66535	66553	66554	66554	He	175	“ She told me that she was trying to be independent and you did n’t like that . ”
66561	66602	66554	66554	He	175	“ Danica ’s version of independent was going on vacation with her friends without me . Repeatedly , and on my dime . When I suggested we take a trip together , she accused me of trying to smother her . ”
66603	66613	66614	66614	she	112	“ Boy , she sounds like a real winner , ”
66625	66663	66617	66617	Logan	175	“ She ’s nothing like you , if that ’s what you ’re worried about . And our relationship is nothing like the one I had with her . Do n’t let her lies get to you . ”
66664	66669	66670	66670	she	112	“ I wo n’t , ”
66691	66699	66700	66700	He	175	“ But you should have told me . ”
66737	66763	66764	66764	His	175	“ Trust me when I say she is not in my life anymore . Has n’t been for some time . There ’s only you . ”
66782	66786	66764	66764	His	175	“ Only you . ”
66813	66820	66821	66821	He	175	“ I want you , Logan . ”
66828	66844	66821	66821	He	175	“ As soon as we get home , I ’m making you mine , Brontë . ”
66935	66954	66929	66929	she	112	“ I do n’t want to wait until we get home , Logan . I want you now . ”
66996	67004	67005	67005	Logan	175	“ I do n’t want to wait . ”
67019	67029	67005	67005	Logan	175	“ I do n’t have a condom , Brontë . ”
67030	67037	67038	67038	she	51	“ I ’m on the pill , ”
67058	67067	67068	67068	His	175	“ Please , Logan . Take me now . ”
67101	67106	67107	67107	he	175	“ Ah , Brontë , ”
67110	67124	67107	67107	he	175	“ Your skin feels like silk . Wet and ready for me already ? ”
67452	67457	67458	67458	she	51	“ I love you , ”
67504	67515	67516	67516	Logan	175	“ This meeting of the brotherhood is called to order , ”
67537	67540	67525	67525	He	175	“ Deal . ”
67998	68004	68005	68005	he	175	“ Sorry I ’m late , ”
68008	68020	68005	68005	he	175	“ Hold up at the office . Someone deal me in ? ”
68021	68027	68028	68028	Logan	175	“ ’ Bout fucking time , ”
68044	68050	68028	68028	Logan	175	“ We can start now . ”
68093	68102	68083	68083	he	112	“ I enjoyed meeting Brontë the other day . ”
68108	68112	68113	68113	Griffin	47	“ Charming girl , ”
68127	68144	68113	68113	Griffin	47	“ Very interesting education . She ’s a step up from your normal airheads , Logan . ”
68145	68151	68152	68152	he	47	“ She ’s a waitress , ”
68155	68164	68152	68152	he	47	“ Do n’t get too attached to her . ”
68182	68193	68194	68194	Logan	175	“ What does her job have to do with anything ? ”
68207	68225	68199	68199	Cade	49	“ She ’s not another Danica . You do n’t know that she ’s after your money . ”
68226	68234	68235	68235	Hunter	112	“ He does n’t not know it , ”
68246	68257	68258	68258	Logan	175	“ Do we have to talk about this right now ? ”
68261	68271	68272	68272	Reese	46	“ Well , clearly it ’s affecting your mood , ”
68276	68303	68272	68272	Reese	46	“ Is the problem that she ’s a waitress or that you like her enough that you ’re worried you ’re being taken for a ride ? ”
68327	68334	68309	68309	He	46	“ She ’s not like Danica . ”
68335	68360	68361	68361	He	46	“ No ? She ’s female , is n’t she ? That means she ’s interested in your wallet . Face facts , Logan . ”
68383	68407	68408	68408	Reese	46	“ Well , if she ’s just a fly - by - night , let me know when you ’re done with her , ”
68411	68424	68425	68425	His	46	“ Because I saw her ass in that little red dress and — ”
68492	68509	68479	68479	Cade	49	“ No fighting during a meeting , remember ? Do we need to take this outside ? ”
68510	68515	68516	68516	Logan	175	“ I ’m fine , ”
68582	68585	68586	68586	he	112	“ Come , ”
68589	68598	68586	68586	he	112	“ Let ’s go walk for a bit . ”
68606	68618	68599	68599	He	112	“ Play on . Logan and I will be back shortly . ”
68724	68738	68690	68692	The scarred man	194	“ So . You do realize that Reese was just busting your balls ? ”
68739	68745	68746	68746	Logan	175	“ I realize that now , ”
68755	68779	68746	68746	Logan	175	“ I ’ve never seen you this stressed over a woman . Even Danica , and we both know she left her mark . ”
68845	68857	68858	68858	Hunter	112	“ I agree with Cade , for what it ’s worth , ”
68862	68905	68858	68858	Hunter	112	“ She does n’t sound like Danica . Griffin likes her . Griffin does n’t like anyone . He says that Brontë ’s very intelligent and can hold a conversation . How many of your supermodels has Griffin ever said that about ? ”
68906	68919	68858	68858	Hunter	112	“ I bought her a necklace . She did n’t want it . ”
68920	68930	68931	68931	Hunter	112	“ But she accepted it , did n’t she ? ”
69017	69025	69026	69026	he	175	“ I need to know for sure , ”
69030	69035	69026	69026	he	175	“ Then test her , ”
69040	69050	69026	69026	he	175	“ It ’s the only way to be sure . ”
69442	69452	69428	69428	Brontë	112	“ You ’re home early , are n’t you ? ”
69453	69465	69466	69466	He	112	“ I am . I canceled the rest of my meetings . ”
69547	69555	69536	69536	Logan	175	“ I have a present for you . ”
69579	69584	69585	69585	He	112	“ Present ? Why ? ”
69599	69611	69585	69585	He	112	“ No reason . I just wanted to give you something . ”
69612	69623	69625	69625	she	51	“ You ’ve already given me enough stuff , Logan . ”
69654	69659	69641	69641	She	51	“ What ’s this ? ”
69660	69696	69697	69697	Brontë	112	“ It ’s the paperwork for the diner . There ’s three of them , actually . One in Kansas City , and the other two are in Dallas and Atlanta . They ’re yours . ”
69712	69715	69716	69716	Her	112	“ Why ? ”
69724	69732	69716	69716	Her	112	“ What do you mean , why ? ”
69733	69748	69805	69805	She	112	“ I mean , why give me a diner ? What ’s the point ? ”
69749	69804	69805	69805	She	112	“ It ’s a gift . Income . You can live off of the profits , if you want , or you can work on improving the chain . I ’ve set up a meeting with the consultant so he can go over what he ’s learned so far and suggest improvements . You — ”
69822	69830	69805	69805	She	112	“ Logan , I do n’t understand . ”
69831	69838	69839	69839	he	112	“ It ’s an expensive gift , ”
69849	69857	69839	69839	he	112	“ Most people would say thank you . ”
69858	69875	69805	69805	She	112	“ I guess I ’m confused . Why do you think I ’d want the diner ? ”
69876	69885	69886	69886	She	112	“ So you can make something of yourself . ”
69889	69903	69886	69886	She	112	“ You mean , so I can be something other than a waitress ? ”
69904	69909	69910	69910	Logan	175	“ Something like that , ”
69925	69930	69919	69919	Brontë	112	“ Keep the diner . ”
69957	69964	69947	69947	Logan	175	“ You do n’t want it ? ”
70032	70038	70039	70039	he	175	“ Where are you going ? ”
70044	70056	70057	70057	Brontë	112	“ You said I could stay as long as I wanted , ”
70064	70078	70057	70057	Brontë	112	“ This is as long as I want . I ’m done here . ”
70079	70099	70100	70100	You	112	“ Why ? His voice was harsh . Anger rocketed through him . This was completely irrational of her . “
70112	70113	70100	70100	You	112	” “
70116	70125	70126	70126	I	0	” she cried , turning to face him . “
70165	70166	70152	70152	you	112	” “
70176	70177	70152	70152	you	112	” “
70188	70195	70152	70152	you	112	” Her eyes shimmered with tears . “
70198	70230	70231	70231	I	0	” he said , his voice soft . He moved to draw her into his arms , but she stiffened and pulled away . He ’d made a mistake , then . “
70247	70248	70240	70240	I	0	” “
70263	70264	70256	70256	I	0	” “
70270	70274	70256	70256	I	0	” he confessed . “
70278	70287	70256	70256	I	0	” Her voice rose an octave in response . “
70296	70307	70310	70311	my God	1567	” He remained silent at that . Her eyes widened . “
70339	70345	70328	70328	You	1567	” Logan ’s jaw tightened . “
70352	70353	70328	70328	You	1567	” “
70360	70365	70366	70366	I	0	” she said bitterly . “
70372	70373	70366	70366	I	0	” “
70378	70383	70374	70374	You	1567	” she bit out . “
70427	70428	70400	70400	Logan	175	” “
70442	70443	70444	70444	You	1567	” “
70450	70460	70444	70444	You	1567	” she said , viciously slamming her suitcase shut . “
70473	70474	70469	70469	Danica	51	” “
70485	70486	70475	70475	Danica	51	” “
70511	70525	70505	70505	I	0	” Tears spilled down her cheeks , driving a knife into his gut . “
70535	70574	70529	70529	she	51	” She moved to the dresser and pulled out a blue velvet case — the necklace case . She looked at it and her lip curled , almost in disgust , and she held it out to him . “
70578	70579	70582	70582	yours	1567	” “
70584	70590	70582	70582	yours	1567	” Brontë shook her head . “
70613	70648	70607	70607	you	1567	” When she held it out again and he did n’t reach for it , she tossed it on the bed as if it were garbage and pulled out the handle of her suitcase . “
70651	70663	70607	70607	you	1567	” he said , trying to take the suitcase from her . “
70671	70672	70664	70664	We	1065	” “
70675	70686	70664	70664	We	1065	” she said , and her voice broke a little . “
70705	70723	70703	70703	Logan	175	” She pushed past him and headed out the front door , rolling the suitcase behind her . “
70726	70727	70703	70703	Logan	175	” “
70730	70734	70703	70703	Logan	175	” she repeated . “
70743	71500	70741	70741	Logan	175	” And she turned and left . He watched her go , his mind seething with turmoil . She was n’t willing to listen to reason right now . She was furious — and she had every right to be , he supposed — but he was n’t going to give up . Somehow , he ’d get her to talk to him again . He ’d explain his side of the story , and then they ’d hash things out . Kiss and make up . And then he could tell her he loved her like he should have — with no strings attached . He went back to the room she ’d emptied and stared at the discarded necklace box . I told you did n’t want it , and you pushed it on me . It seemed like he ’d pushed and pushed until she ’d finally broken . Damn it . There had to be a way to fix this . Chapter Ten Brontë dashed down the street , ignoring the people around her . The suitcase dragged behind her on tiny wheels , slowing her down , but she did n’t care . Hot tears splashed down her cheeks , and her heart felt like a burning hole in her chest . Logan wanted her to make something of herself . The words made her sick . He did n’t like who she was . He thought she was a joke . Worse , someone to be embarrassed of . Well , screw that , and screw him , she thought , dashing the tears from her cheek with the back of one hand . A subway station appeared down the street , and she headed for it , needing a sense of purpose . Somewhere to go . Anywhere . Of course , when she got into the station itself , she swiped the MetroCard she ’d gotten with Audrey while shopping and then realized that she had nowhere to go . She frowned and took a seat on one of the benches , staring in dismay at a nearby map of subway interchanges . She ’d been so content , wrapped up in her little cocoon that Logan had created for her , that she had n’t even bothered to sightsee in the city she ’d been so excited to visit . No Statue of Liberty , no Guggenheim , nothing . All she ’d done was go shopping and attend a party . And spend hours in Logan ’s bed , being pleasured out of her mind , she corrected herself . Except he did n’t want her . Not really . Brontë the waitress was embarrassing . He needed her to be Brontë the small business owner so he could retain his billionaire street cred or something . She sighed in humiliation and hugged the suitcase closer to her as someone sat down on the far end of the bench . And here she was , stranded all over again . Except this time , there was n’t an elevator or a hurricane or a handsome man to keep her company . This time she was stuck in New York City with nowhere to go and no one to talk to , her heart broken into a hundred pieces . She could always go straight to the airport . Call this little vacation quits , admit defeat , and return home . Of course , then she ’d have to find another job . Logan was her new boss , after all . She would n’t be able to stay at the diner knowing that at any moment he could come through that door and insist that she talk to him again . So . New job . It was a shame . She liked her coworkers . Despair threatened to overwhelm her . She ’d lost the man she loved , lost her job , and was stuck in a strange city . Had she ever been lower ? Tears welled in her eyes . Music began to play at the far end of the station , and she automatically looked up . A man stood by a pillar , his violin case open , his soft song echoing in the tunnel . Someone passed by and dropped a dollar , barely even looking , but Brontë was entranced . She was sitting in New York City , and she had n’t even explored the place . “
71505	71560	71561	71562	Audrey Petty	244	” she told herself . Aristotle had it right . Why not visit all the places in New York City that she wanted to see before going home ? A thought occurred to her , and she pulled out her phone , flipping through the list of numbers . She dialed a recent one . “
71564	71573	71574	71574	Audrey	244	” the woman on the line answered promptly . “
71582	71583	71578	71578	me	0	” “
71586	71596	71578	71578	me	0	” The other woman sounded confused for a moment . “
71603	71604	71578	71578	me	0	” “
71612	71623	71578	71578	me	0	” Brontë said , her eyes on the subway map . “
71629	71796	71797	71797	You	1066	” Just saying it out loud made her chest ache . They ’d had a whirlwind courtship . She ’d fallen fast , and she ’d fallen hard . Logan Hawkings was going to be a difficult man to get over , she realized . She felt raw , completely shredded on the inside . Part of her wanted to turn around and hear him explain , to have him soothe away her hurt , and to return into his arms . She would ’ve done anything just to curl up against him again . Except he did n’t love her , did he ? She ’d told him that she loved him , and he ’d given her a polite pat on the back . And then he ’d tried to fix her , which rankled . Danica had been right . She ’d blindly trusted him , and he ’d tried to shove her into the mold of what he thought she should be . “
71803	71807	71797	71797	You	1066	” Audrey paused . “
71823	71831	71820	71821	His assistant	713	” A weepy little laugh escaped her . “
71843	71844	71832	71832	You	1066	” “
71847	71865	71832	71832	You	1066	” Audrey got quiet . Then she sighed , as if resigned to her course of action . “
71870	71871	71868	71868	you	1066	” “
71875	71876	71868	71868	you	1066	” “
71882	71923	71924	71924	I	0	” Brontë curled up on the bench , feeling a little foolish . The subway map looked like a bunch of scribbly lines to her , and she ’d never even taken as much as a bus in her life . “
71937	71938	71933	71933	Logan	175	” “
71970	71971	71966	71966	We	1071	” “
71976	71981	71974	71974	Audrey	244	” she said softly . “
71986	71987	71988	71988	You	1066	” “
71991	72180	72183	72183	Audrey	244	” the assistant said , and hung up . The violinist began to play a sad tune , and Brontë ’s heart sank with every sorrowful note . Logan did n’t love her . She ’d given him everything he ’d asked for — her time , her attention , her affection — and he ’d still thought she was n’t good enough . A fresh onrush of sadness rippled through her , and she swiped at her eyes again , frustrated with her own emotions . Crying did n’t do any good . She was sad and hurt — okay , more like devastated — but she was also angry with herself . She ’d let Logan control how their relationship had gone , and she ’d gotten burned . If she ever dated someone like him again , she would n’t make the same stupid mistake twice . * * * Audrey showed up a short time later , a rounded bundle in a stylish gray peacoat . She was always dressed as if about to head into the office , Brontë realized with a sniff . “
72185	72186	72183	72183	Audrey	244	” “
72189	72203	72204	72204	You	244	” she said , immediately offering a small packet of tissues to Brontë . “
72208	72215	72204	72204	You	244	” Eyes watering , she nodded . “
72226	72227	72204	72204	You	244	” “
72230	72238	72239	72239	I	0	” Audrey said , a little troubled . “
72290	72296	72297	72297	He	1072	” Brontë blew her nose . “
72305	72310	72297	72297	He	1072	” Her face crumpled . “
72321	72322	72323	72323	Ouch	128	” “
72325	72326	72323	72323	Ouch	128	” “
72339	72340	72335	72335	he	1072	” “
72366	72375	72353	72353	his	1072	” She glanced down at Brontë ’s suitcase . “
72391	72392	72393	72393	I	0	” “
72397	72406	72393	72393	I	0	” She lifted her wet eyes to Audrey . “
72417	72418	72410	72410	I	0	” “
72431	72444	72410	72410	I	0	” Brontë shook her head , her stomach sinking . Audrey sighed . “
72504	72505	72495	72495	You	1075	” “
72509	72514	72506	72506	I	0	” Brontë said miserably . “
72533	72538	72523	72523	I	0	” The assistant brightened . “
72543	72549	72523	72523	I	0	” She snapped her fingers . “
72565	72566	72567	72567	I	0	” “
72573	72589	72567	72567	I	0	” Brontë said . She looked around the subway station and then back at Audrey . “
72604	72613	72590	72590	I	0	” Before crawling back home , she thought . “
72656	72657	72640	72640	I	0	” “
72663	72668	72672	72672	Gretchen	365	” Audrey smiled brightly . “
72680	72772	72672	72672	Gretchen	365	” Brontë thought about her savings account and the tip money she ’d tucked away for a rainy day or a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity . She could cover half a month ’s rent , she supposed , even if it was crazy - expensive compared to Kansas City . And she could take her time , see New York , and try to forget all about the man that had stormed into her life and taken over her heart so completely . She nodded at Audrey . “
72782	72804	72672	72672	Gretchen	365	” * * * They took the subway to SoHo , a part of town that Audrey rolled her eyes at . “
72809	72842	72843	72843	I	0	” Brontë hugged her suitcase close , staring around her at the subway with wide eyes . It seemed . . . crowded . Maybe she just was n’t used to it . “
72854	72855	72843	72843	I	0	” “
72866	72869	72843	72843	I	0	” Ah . “
72878	72879	72880	72880	She	1086	” “
72887	72894	72884	72884	she	1086	” Audrey said with a grin . “
72909	72910	72904	72904	She	1086	” “
72919	72923	72926	72926	she	1086	” Audrey shrugged . “
72951	72967	72940	72940	I	0	” When the subway announced their stop , she grinned and gestured at the door . “
72972	72995	72970	72970	us	1090	” They walked a few blocks to an older apartment building . Audrey jogged up the steps and pushed the call button . “
73000	73001	72970	72970	us	1090	” “
73016	73121	73010	73010	I	0	” The door buzzed , and Audrey grabbed the handle , motioning for Brontë to enter . Brontë followed Audrey up four flights , the suitcase getting heavier with each step . One of the apartment doors was open by the time they got to the top of the stairs , and a woman who looked just like Audrey was looking at both of them curiously . She was tall , her form hidden by baggy clothing . Unlike Audrey ’s pale orange hair , this woman ’s was a fiery dark red , and she had the brows and pale skin to match . “
73130	73159	73010	73010	I	0	” The other woman crossed her arms over her chest , looking suspicious . Audrey put her arm around Brontë ’s shoulders , tugging her close and beaming . “
73173	73182	73169	73169	Gretchen	365	” Gretchen studied Brontë with one raised eyebrow . “
73190	73191	73169	73169	Gretchen	365	” “
73196	73200	73169	73169	Gretchen	365	” she replied . “
73212	73281	73205	73205	I	0	” Gretchen adjusted square , thick - rimmed nerd glasses on her nose . She was the epitome of a writer on a deadline : Her red hair was pulled into a disheveled bun , her face was devoid of makeup , and she wore a pair of dark yoga pants and a black long - sleeved T - shirt that seemed a size too big for her . “
73298	73299	73290	73290	You	1091	” “
73319	73329	73290	73290	You	1091	” Gretchen flashed an annoyed look at her sister . “
73341	73342	73290	73290	You	1091	” “
73378	73394	73397	73397	he	1101	” Gretchen ’s eyes widened , and she looked at Brontë like she was crazy . “
73400	73401	73397	73397	he	1101	” “
73405	73410	73411	73411	He	1101	” Brontë said defensively . “
73420	73428	73411	73411	He	1101	” The writer blinked behind her glasses . “
73441	73496	73411	73411	He	1101	” The apartment was small but cheerful , with plants on the windowsill and bookshelves lining the living room . A computer desk covered in paper and books sat at the far end of the apartment , and more books covered the countertops in the kitchen . Brontë immediately liked it , of course . “
73501	73502	73411	73411	He	1101	” “
73505	73522	73411	73411	He	1101	” Gretchen said , brushing past and opening the door to the bedroom down the hall . “
73529	73567	73411	73411	He	1101	” That was an understatement . The room was the size of her closet back home , but there was a narrow bed against the wall and a small dresser , which was really all she needed . “
73573	73577	73578	73578	I	0	” she said . “
73603	73607	73608	73608	I	0	” Gretchen shrugged . “
73629	73630	73619	73619	I	0	” “
73633	73634	73635	73635	I	0	” “
73645	73646	73647	73647	He	1105	” “
73651	73656	73657	73657	He	1105	” Audrey said flatly . “
73661	73687	73688	73688	He	1105	” Gretchen opened her bedroom door and picked a small lump up off of the corner of the bed and held it out to Brontë . “
73694	73769	73688	73688	He	1105	” Igor blinked enormous eyes at Brontë . Gretchen ’s cat was hairless , apparently . It looked like a naked rat , if she was honest with herself . The thing had long , spindly legs and wrinkly gray skin . Enormous triangle ears jutted from the tiny , pointy face , and it stared up at her with wide golden eyes and then meowed . Brontë laughed at the sight of him . “
73783	73787	73688	73688	He	1105	” Gretchen said . “
73791	74448	73688	73688	He	1105	” * * * Brontë curled under the blankets of her new temporary apartment . The bed was narrow and uncomfortable , with a spring sticking into her lower back , and she was pretty sure she could hear someone talking on the other side of the wall . She got out of bed and padded over to the small window of her room , pushing it open a crack . It eased open only about two inches , just enough to let the sounds of the street below carry into the room . The apartment was n’t glamorous , but Gretchen seemed nice , and Brontë still had a curious fascination for New York . Being here in the apartment felt a bit like hiding from reality . Back home , she ’d have to deal with the fact that she ’d slept with the boss and then broken up with him . But for now ? She could hide away in this tiny room with a bunch of expensive clothes that would do her no good , a jillion books , a hairless cat , and a writer who was , even at two in the morning , seated at her computer and working frantically on her manuscript . It still felt a bit like an escape . She ’d left the diamond necklace behind , too . She supposed she could have sold it for rent money , but that would have been . . . painful . And unfair . And somehow wrong . It seemed to symbolize their relationship , and she could n’t have sold it . She just could n’t have . Brontë wondered if Logan would be looking for her . She hugged her knees close , a stab of pain in her heart . The night before she ’d been curled in his arms , deliciously sated after a round of incredible , blissful sex . He ’d pulled her close and hugged her against him , his fingers playing over her skin as she drifted off to sleep , and she ’d thought that she ’d never been held so tenderly . Funny how a day could put things into perspective . Fresh tears burned in her eyes , and she blinked them back . He had n’t wanted her . Not really . He liked her in bed . It was just out of it that she was . . . lacking . Oh , Logan , she thought sadly . Why did I have to fall for you ? You ’re going to be a hard one to get over . But even as she said the words to herself , she knew . There were just some men you never got over , and she suspected that Logan Hawkings might be one of them . * * * Brontë woke up the next morning reaching for Logan . Her heart sank when the realization struck her — he was n’t there . Not the best way to wake up in the morning . She pushed the sadness away and got out of bed , heading to the kitchen . Maybe today she ’d get out and explore the city . She needed a new focus to keep her mind off of Logan . Exploring would do the job just as well as anything else . Of course , she ’d be alone , which was a little depressing , but there was nothing to do about that . Gretchen sat eating a bowl of cereal in the tiny portion of the apartment designated as the kitchen . She was dressed in a white T - shirt and black pants . Unlike the night before , she now wore makeup and her hair was up in a ponytail . The oddly naked cat rubbed against the leg of her pants , begging for attention . “
74454	74462	74463	74463	Yup	132	” Brontë asked in a friendly voice . “
74465	74477	74463	74463	Yup	132	” Gretchen picked up her bowl and went to the sink . “
74482	74492	74463	74463	Yup	132	” Brontë sat down at the small kitchen table . “
74503	74504	74496	74496	I	0	” “
74529	74533	74518	74518	I	0	” Brontë smiled . “
74550	74582	74583	74583	He	1109	” Gretchen snorted , dropping her spoon into the sink and placing her bowl on the floor . Igor ran over at it immediately and began to lap up the milk . “
74612	74613	74603	74603	He	1109	” “
74625	74635	74619	74619	I	0	” The other woman gave her a sympathetic look . “

74696	74704	74705	74705	Gotcha	95	” Brontë touched her face , blushing . “
74727	74728	74718	74718	I	0	” “
74748	74749	74750	74750	I	0	” “
74754	74793	74750	74750	I	0	” It probably was Gucci or something equally expensive and ridiculous . She thought of Logan briefly . Would n’t he just hate that she was wearing the designer clothes he ’d bought for her and serving drinks ? “
74804	75183	74799	74799	I	0	” * * * For a week straight , Logan had called the consultant that he ’d left at the Kansas City diner . Every day , the answer was the same . Brontë had n’t come back to work . She had n’t called . She certainly had n’t called Logan . It was driving him crazy , too . Logan rubbed a hand over his face wearily . He had n’t slept as well without Brontë there . His empty bed just felt wrong , as if it were missing something vital . His apartment , too . He ’d run across a stack of books she ’d left in the library for him . Real books , not the fakes he ’d had lining the shelves because he ’d been too busy to bother . She ’d cleared the false fronts out of one of his shelves and had begun to fill it with her favorites . He ’d found a book on top of the stack with a yellow Post - it stuck to the dust jacket . The Post - it had a smiley face on it . The book ? Plato ’s Collected Works . Seeing that had made his chest ache . She ’d clearly been thinking of him when she ’d gone shopping . Thinking of him with love . And he ’d been the asshole who doubted her . Even after everything they ’d been through together on the island , he ’d still not quite believed she liked him for him , not his money . When she ’d gone , she ’d left behind the necklace he ’d bought her and taken only her clothes . He suspected that if she could have left those behind without going naked , she would have done that , too . She truly did n’t want his money . Just him . Except now she did n’t want him at all . He felt like an ass . And he wanted her back , because he wanted to explain himself . To try to explain why he ’d done something that was clearly so hurtful to her . But she was n’t anywhere . Logan called his private investigator again . “
75187	75188	74799	74799	I	0	” “
75221	75280	75213	75213	she	1114	” But Brontë did n’t know anyone in the city other than him and his friends . Worry made him grit his teeth . If anything happened to her , he ’d go mad . He needed her back . She was the only thing that felt right in his life anymore . * * * One Week Later “
75291	75312	75281	75281	I	0	” Brontë said with a smile at Cooper and Gretchen as she finished the whip on a soy mocha latte . “
75320	75333	75334	75334	Fat	136	” Gretchen leaned over the counter and peered at the tip jar . “
75355	75356	75357	75357	I	0	” “
75360	75367	75357	75357	I	0	” Brontë said with a nod . “

75387	75397	75374	75375	Pretty Woman	1118	” Gretchen teased . Brontë shot her a look . “
75401	75402	75403	75403	Cloverfield	137	” “
75405	75409	75410	75410	I	0	” suggested Cooper . “
75422	75423	75416	75416	I	0	” “
75432	75444	75430	75430	Cooper	135	” Gretchen said , tossing a hand towel over her shoulder . “
75453	75546	75446	75446	you	135	” Cooper flushed at her tease , heading back to the counter when a new customer lined up . Brontë winced at the adoring look that Cooper cast at Gretchen before smiling at the customers . After a week of working at Cooper ’s Cuppa , two things had become extremely obvious to her : one , that Cooper was one of the nicest guys she had ever met anywhere , and two , that he was carrying a major torch for Gretchen . A torch that Gretchen seemed determined to ignore . “
75551	75566	75625	75625	She	244	” Gretchen asked , pulling out a mug and drying it with her towel . “
75602	75603	75606	75606	me	0	” “
75608	75612	75606	75606	me	0	” Brontë said . “
75618	75624	75625	75625	She	244	” Gretchen shook her head . “
75641	75642	75629	75631	A certain someone	1119	” “
75645	75660	75629	75631	A certain someone	1119	” Brontë feigned casualness , even though her heart sped up at the thought . “
75666	75679	75680	75680	Gretchen	365	” The redhead said nothing , just continued to wipe mugs dry . “
75682	75683	75680	75680	Gretchen	365	” “
75728	75736	75720	75720	he	1121	” She gave Brontë a pointed look . “
75745	75746	75747	75747	I	0	” “
75751	75784	75747	75747	I	0	” Brontë promised , but her mind was already racing . Why was Logan missing meetings ? Was he all right ? She squelched the rising worry and forced herself to focus . “
75791	75792	75747	75747	I	0	” “
75797	75801	75747	75747	I	0	” Gretchen said . “

75837	75838	75841	75841	Gretchen	365	” “
75848	75859	75841	75841	Gretchen	365	” Gretchen waved a hand , dismissing Brontë ’s compliment . “
75934	75938	75921	75921	I	0	” Brontë smiled . “
75959	75960	75949	75949	I	0	” “
76013	76033	76004	76004	she	244	” An order popped up on the screen , and Brontë moved to the blender to prepare the drink . “
76043	76044	76034	76035	Your sister	1086	” “
76055	76066	76067	76067	He	1130	” Brontë bristled a little at Gretchen ’s dismissive tone . “
76074	76075	76067	76067	He	1130	” “
76085	76309	76077	76083	the now proud owner of a diner	1131	” Gretchen teased . Brontë flushed , turning the blender on so she would n’t have to hear more about it . Perhaps she should n’t have shared so much of her story with Gretchen . The woman was fun to live with , and funny , but she had a caustic sense of humor and absolutely zero patience for anything related to Logan Hawkings . He kept Audrey hopping , apparently , and Gretchen resented it . Brontë handed the blended drink to a customer with a smile , struggling to hide her heartache . After a few days , the pain had dulled into an ever - present ache that triggered tears at the slightest thought of Logan . Unfortunately for her , almost everything seemed to inspire thoughts of Logan . She and Gretchen had gone out for drinks the night before , and when someone at the bar had ordered a hurricane , she ’d nearly burst into tears . The girls working the evening shift came in to Cooper ’s Cuppa , and Brontë and Gretchen left the counter , heading to the back room to take off their aprons and count out their tips . As Brontë stuffed her apron into her locker , Gretchen pulled out her phone and checked her text messages , then sighed . “
76336	76344	76329	76329	She	244	” Brontë pretended to flex her muscles . “
76347	76348	76329	76329	She	244	” “
76370	76784	76361	76361	Audrey	244	” * * * Hunter strolled through the empty , silent town house , regarding it with an eye long - used to appraising at a glance . He mentally sized up the asking price , tallying all the things that would make it a prize — the luxurious décor , the reputation of the prior owner , the fact that it was a historical building , and the number one thing that always made his interest perk : location . The Upper East Side was a great one . This town house , he knew , would command several million on the market . . . provided he bothered to put it up for sale . It was a lovely gem of a home , and one of the Brotherhood might be interested in it . Griffin , perhaps , he thought , examining the Victorian wainscoting . An elegant townhouse would be something he ’d be in the market for . Reese wanted it for a director friend of his , but Brotherhood came first . He ’d probably offer to Griffin to see if he was interested , and if not , talk to Reese ’s friend . Hunter stopped and cocked his head , listening . Someone had entered the town house . At the sound of voices , he paused in the foyer of the enormous home . Out of habit , he moved into a shadowy alcove , lest they catch him unawares and stop to stare at him . Even after years of being a scarred , ugly bastard , he was still bothered by the expressions people made at the sight of his face . It was easier to just blend in with the shadows until they were gone . He waited , his ears straining to determine who was there . The only people he ’d expected to stop by were Logan ’s assistant , who ’d insisted on picking up some of his books for a donation , and the movers who ’d come to clean out the rest of what was left in the house . He ’d thought the place would be empty , so it would be a perfect time for him to inspect it . He had n’t realized someone else would be coming in , much less two women . There was a shuffle of footsteps , and then the sound of a box thumping onto the ground . “
76790	76799	76361	76361	Audrey	244	” A soft , pleasant female voice asked . “
76804	76805	76361	76361	Audrey	244	” “
76819	76838	76814	76814	I	0	” The other woman ’s voice seemed full of laughter and amusement , but her tone was cutting . “
76864	76865	76861	76861	Audrey	244	” “
76872	76969	76867	76867	we	1139	” The women approached Hunter ’s shadowed hiding place , and he stilled , waiting for them to pass without noticing him . The redhead was standing not ten feet away from him , her head bent . He could n’t see her face , but she was curvy and tall , her ass a perfect heart from where he was standing , and her hair was a brilliant shade of red . The other girl — a pretty brunette with wide eyes — balanced two boxes and was waiting for instructions from the other woman . “
76978	76983	76970	76970	I	0	” the redhead said . “
76999	77000	76970	76970	I	0	” “
77003	77011	76970	76970	I	0	” the dark - haired one asked . “
77014	77042	76970	76970	I	0	” the redhead said in a crisp voice , and Hunter came to attention . That was a familiar name . But the redhead was still talking . “
77060	77061	77052	77052	She	112	” “
77072	77073	77066	77066	She	112	” “
77123	77143	77116	77116	I	0	” She put the phone to her ear . A few seconds later , she made a frustrated sound . “
77173	77174	77167	77167	she	112	” “
77181	77194	77195	77195	I	0	” the brunette placated her , adjusting the boxes in her arms . “

77209	77219	77206	77207	Logan Hawkings	175	” the redhead exclaimed , catching Hunter ’s attention . “
77233	77245	77231	77231	he	175	” The look on the other woman ’s face was sad . “
77249	77250	77251	77251	Ugh	68	” “
77273	77283	77271	77271	you	1146	” The brunette turned sad eyes on her friend . “
77315	77316	77333	77334	a jerk	1147	” “
77342	77406	77336	77336	You	1146	” The redhead turned , and Hunter got a good look at her face for the first time . She was unusual - looking , with round cheeks smattered in freckles . Her expressive eyes dominated her face despite being hidden behind square , scholarly glasses . Her chin ended in a small point , and she looked fascinating . Smart . Annoyed . “
77439	77440	77432	77432	they	1148	” “
77448	77455	77446	77446	Gretchen	365	” the one called Brontë protested . “
77461	77470	77446	77446	Gretchen	365	” Gretchen said in a cheerfully acerbic voice . “
77496	77521	77475	77485	a man who is n’t in love with his own reflection	1554	” She bent over , and that heart - shaped ass was thrust into his vision again , and his cock stirred with need . “
77545	77546	77527	77543	a pizza guy with a weak chin and a knight - in - shining - armor complex	1153	” “
77549	77564	77565	77565	His	1153	” Gretchen said emphatically , and a dimple flashed in her pointed little face . “
77576	77865	77565	77565	His	1153	” So she said . Hunter knew from experience that what women said they wanted in a man was soon forgetten if his physical appearance was unappealing . Still , he was fascinated with her . She was brash and clever , and a little sardonic , as if she were as weary of the world as he was . He watched as the two women , arguing and laughing , stepped out of the foyer of the empty home with the boxes of donations that he ’d left for Logan ’s assistant . Her name was Gretchen . Gretchen . He racked his brain , trying to think of anyone who knew a Gretchen . A lovely redhead with a charmingly unusual face and a cutting tongue . He wanted to know more about her . . . Hunter touched the jagged scars running down the left side of his face and frowned . Would she find him as hideous as the rest of the world did ? Probably . But she ’d also said she could look past that . That she was n’t interested in a face as much as the brain behind it . He was curious whether she ’d been telling the truth . Not that it mattered , since she ’d just walked out the door and he ’d likely never see her again . A half - buried memory stirred in the back of his mind as he stared at the now - shut door . The other woman had an unusual name . Brontë . He knew that name , and where he ’d heard it before . He dialed Logan ’s number , still thinking about the unusual redhead . “
77870	77874	77875	77875	I	0	” Logan said . “
77884	77885	77875	77875	I	0	” “
77904	77921	77938	77938	she	0	” Hunter asked . The voice on the other end of the line got very still . “
77924	77931	77938	77938	she	0	” Logan asked after a moment . “
77940	77965	77966	77966	She	0	” Hunter stared at the door , half wishing the women would come back through it again , and half relieved they would n’t . “
77983	77984	77975	77975	I	0	” “
77989	77997	78000	78000	Gretchen	365	” Logan ’s voice was a growl . “
78012	78013	78008	78008	I	0	” “
78016	78021	78024	78024	man	726	” A long sigh . “
78047	78056	78057	78057	I	0	” Logan ’s voice sounded strained , tense . “
78072	78073	78070	78070	you	1157	” “
78083	78145	78070	78070	you	1157	” Hunter had been overseeing it to ensure that nothing was out of place . Plus , he ’d been bored and restless . And more than a little lonely . He was n’t lonely any more , though . He could n’t stop thinking about that redhead . Gretchen , with her big glasses and pert comebacks and red hair . “
78158	78165	78070	78070	you	1157	” Hunter said after a moment . “
78177	78178	78167	78167	Gretchen	365	” “
78184	78188	78179	78179	I	0	” Logan said . “
78200	78201	78192	78192	Audrey	244	” “
78210	78219	78220	78220	I	0	” Hunter reminded me . I want her . “
78226	78237	78238	78238	I	0	” Logan ’s tone had changed from dejected to triumphant . “
78243	78244	78245	78245	You	0	” “
78248	78252	78245	78245	You	0	” Hunter agreed . “
78268	78308	78309	78309	I	0	” Things had suddenly gotten a bit more . . . interesting . Hunter glanced at the empty townhouse and smiled to himself , his mind full of the unusual woman who had been there minutes before . Chapter Eleven “
78317	78347	78309	78309	I	0	” Cooper said as Brontë and Gretchen came in to work . Brontë pulled her apron out of her locker , frowning as she tied it behind her back . “
78350	78351	78309	78309	I	0	” “
78363	78367	78309	78309	I	0	” Gretchen said . “
78384	78397	78398	78398	I	0	” Cooper beamed at them , his gaze resting on Gretchen adoringly . “
78410	78411	78398	78398	I	0	” “
78419	78428	78398	78398	I	0	” Gretchen asked , glancing over at Brontë . “
78443	78447	78435	78435	I	0	” Gretchen frowned . “
78453	78469	78435	78435	I	0	” A queasy feeling began to stir in Brontë ’s stomach . Oh , no . “
78475	78476	78470	78470	I	0	” “
78490	78498	78499	78499	Congrats	141	” Gretchen blinked wide eyes at him . “
78504	78505	78501	78501	I	0	” “
78528	78597	78523	78523	I	0	” Oh , no . Brontë stared at the door to the back room , then pushed it open , entering the main sitting area of the small coffee shop . Her stomach gave an unpleasant twist as she saw a familiar pair of shoulders in a tailored gray sport coat . Logan . He turned , and her heart skipped a beat even as her stomach dropped . “
78600	78617	78523	78523	I	0	” His eyes moved over her body , as if assessing whether it was really her . “
78626	78638	78624	78624	Logan	175	” His gaze seemed to cool a bit at her response . “
78644	78657	78624	78624	Logan	175	” Not again ! This man was going to drive her mad . “
78663	78664	78624	78624	Logan	175	” “
78670	78721	78624	78624	Logan	175	” He stood and moved forward , reaching for her arm . Brontë quickly sidestepped his grip and began to pull off her apron . If he owned another place where she worked , it was another one she ’d have to abandon . God , this was getting ridiculous . “
78731	78732	78624	78624	Logan	175	” “
78746	78785	78788	78788	Brontë	112	” His voice lowered and became husky as he moved to stand closer to her . He was so close that her body trembled with his nearness , but she forced herself to hold still . Remain strong . “
78790	78797	78788	78788	Brontë	112	” It was that soft , low “
78799	78865	78867	78867	you	1170	” that made her knees turn weak and her resolve melt away like butter . She looked up at his face , noticed the circles under his eyes , and gave a sharp nod . Brontë turned and glanced back at Cooper and Gretchen . Cooper was watching her curiously , but Gretchen ’s arms were crossed and she looked annoyed on Brontë ’s behalf . “
78875	78879	78881	78881	my	0	” Brontë asked . “
78884	78921	78881	78881	my	0	” Cooper volunteered , pulling the key out of his pocket and holding it out to Brontë . She took it and turned toward the back office . Gretchen stepped forward , concern in her eyes . “
78931	78932	78933	78933	I	0	” “
78938	78977	78933	78933	I	0	” she told Gretchen , and squeezed her hand in thanks . She ’d only known her for a short period of time , but already Audrey ’s sister had been a great and supportive friend to her . “
78987	79135	78933	78933	I	0	” Gretchen said , casting a scowl in Logan ’s direction . Brontë nodded and went to the door of Cooper ’s office , not glancing behind her to see whether Logan was following . If he wanted to talk , well , he ’d come after her . Her fingers were shaking as she tried to calmly unlock the door , and it seemed like forever before she could turn the key in the lock and get it open . Once the door was open , though , she stepped inside and flicked on the light . Logan entered close behind her , and Brontë shut the door after him so no one could listen in . He immediately reached out and touched her cheek in a gentle caress before she could back away . His gaze moved over her , scanning her face and figure . “
79153	79181	79182	79182	I	0	” She stepped aside and out of his grasp , even though every nerve ending in her body screamed for her to go back to his arms . “
79195	79196	79188	79188	I	0	” “
79202	79212	79213	79213	I	0	” His hand dropped , the movement seeming defeated . “
79233	79277	79278	79278	I	0	” So he ’d had his flunkies checking up on her ? She was n’t surprised , especially considering how he ’d used every means available to find her last time . That was one reason why she ’d stayed in New York . “
79294	79295	79296	79296	I	0	” “
79301	79360	79361	79361	I	0	” The words were quiet but laced with emotion . Brontë crossed her arms over her chest , staring at the floor . She refused to meet his gaze . If she did , she might see the emotion there , and it would make her weaken . She wanted to be strong . Needed to be strong . “
79400	79401	79402	79402	I	0	” “
79464	79491	79462	79462	Brontë	112	” Logan reached for her again , and then dropped his hand before he could touch her , as if suddenly remembering to respect her boundaries . “
79528	79537	79517	79517	I	0	” His mouth crooked in a half smile . “
79557	79582	79517	79517	I	0	” She was in danger of letting the nervous giggle escape , but she dug her fingernails into her palms until the feeling passed . “
79605	79664	79665	79665	I	0	” Even now , the words hurt . He sighed , and the sound made her look up at him . Logan ’s handsome face was drawn . He normally looked confident and supremely in control , but right now , he just looked . . . desolate . Good , she thought with a little mental stab . “
79689	79695	79696	79696	I	0	” His gaze met hers . “
79789	79798	79799	79799	You	1175	” He ran a hand down his face . “
79840	79841	79828	79828	I	0	” “
79845	79849	79828	79828	I	0	” she agreed . “
79860	79861	79852	79852	you	1175	” “
79871	79877	79852	79852	you	1175	” He shook his head . “
79986	80009	80010	80010	I	0	” Nice words . She felt her resolve weakened by them and by his entreating gaze . But she shook her head . “
80059	80060	80066	80066	Brontë	112	” “
80079	80104	80105	80105	You	1175	” She remained silent . Logan moved forward . His fingertips touched her chin and tilted her head back until she met his eyes . “
80117	80132	80133	80133	I	0	” A knot formed in her throat , and she met his gaze steadily . “
80137	80143	80144	80144	You	1175	” Logan ’s eyes hardened . “
80148	80149	80150	80150	I	0	” “
80153	80165	80150	80150	I	0	” she told him , even though it was a lie . “
80190	80191	80192	80192	I	0	” “
80197	80214	80192	80192	I	0	” he told her , and the fingers under her chin began to caress her jaw . “
80223	80233	80234	80234	Logan	175	” Her throat went dry at his husky words . “
80238	80239	80234	80234	Logan	175	” “
80246	80251	80252	80252	I	0	” he told her . “
80317	80318	80313	80313	I	0	” “
80350	80355	80356	80356	I	0	” His mouth quirked . “
80397	80432	80438	80438	Logan	175	” Tears stung her eyes . He ’d been reading philosophy ? To try and understand her better ? Hope unfurled in her breast , but she forced herself to be calm , careful . “
80485	80486	80477	80477	Both	118	” “
80500	80566	80493	80493	Brontë	112	” He moved close , his mouth inches away from hers , and her pulse began to pound . Just an inch or two more and his lips would be on hers , coaxing hers into opening for him , his tongue thrusting into her mouth and conquering her all over again . . . Brontë took a step backward , out of his grasp . “
80580	80592	80575	80575	We	1200	” Logan ’s gaze was caressing as it moved over her . “
80595	80644	80575	80575	We	1200	” He stopped short . A flash of pain flickered in his eyes , quickly masked , and Brontë was both pleased to see that pain and saddened by it . Pleased because it meant he was genuinely invested , and saddened that she had to hurt him . “
80653	80657	80575	80575	We	1200	” Logan asked . “
80660	80719	80575	80575	We	1200	” she said again quickly . Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts . She needed more time to process how she felt about Logan . More time to pull herself together . More time to just be . . . her . An idea hit her , and she looked up at him with a bright smile . “
80726	80727	80720	80720	I	0	” “
80730	80744	80720	80720	I	0	” His brows furrowed , as if the concept were foreign to him . “
80747	80756	80720	80720	I	0	” she said , warming to her topic . “
80828	80829	80822	80822	I	0	” “
80834	80848	80830	80830	I	0	” he said , and his tone was nearly a growl of frustration . “
80867	80868	80865	80865	Brontë	112	” “
80877	80882	80875	80875	Logan	175	” she said firmly . “
80930	81008	80918	80918	we	1201	” She suspected that she was still head over heels in love with him , but dating meant that she ’d have him all to herself and that they ’d be on familiar territory . She was n’t at home at fancy society parties . But at a pizza place or a movie ? She could relax and just be herself . There was a challenging gleam in his eyes that made her pulse flutter with excitement . “
81026	81027	81023	81023	I	0	” “
81030	81049	81023	81023	I	0	” she said enthusiastically , and when he leaned in to kiss her , she ducked away again . “
81054	81055	81023	81023	I	0	” “
81063	81064	81023	81023	I	0	” “
81069	81074	81023	81023	I	0	” she said lightly . “
81082	81103	81104	81104	I	0	” She stressed the last two words and turned to the door , then glanced over her shoulder at him . “
81129	81138	81147	81147	Brontë	112	” She could practically hear his teeth grinding . “
81149	81171	81147	81147	Brontë	112	” Then prove it , she thought . But she gave him only an enigmatic smile and opened the office door . “
81177	81343	81147	81147	Brontë	112	” Brontë forced herself to walk calmly through the store room and back out to the main café . With calm hands , she lifted the bar , stepped in behind it , and then let it slide shut behind her again , taking her place next to the others behind the counter . She immediately approached the line of customers , smiled at Gretchen , and then took over manning the register . A few moments later , her heart flipped in her breast as she watched Logan ’s tall form walk past the bar and leave the café . Had he given up on her ? So quickly ? Confused , she concentrated on the complicated order a very patient woman was trying to place . Brontë had to ask her to repeat it twice , because her head was n’t in the right place . Had she messed things up with Logan ? Had he decided she was n’t worth the effort ? “
81349	81404	81147	81147	Brontë	112	” she told the woman as she completed her order . Just then the phone in her pocket began to vibrate . Brontë jumped and pulled it out with shaking fingers and turned away from the cash register . Logan Hawkings , the screen read , and her heart thumped wildly in her chest . “
81409	81413	81414	81414	I	0	” she answered . “
81419	81427	81414	81414	I	0	” Logan said in a gruff voice . “
81433	81461	81414	81414	I	0	” That wild , nervous giggle escaped , and she clapped a hand over her mouth in embarrassment . When she recovered , she cleared her throat . “
81469	81470	81414	81414	I	0	” “
81478	81479	81480	81480	I	0	” “
81489	81527	81484	81484	I	0	” she said calmly , though she could n’t stop grinning . He made a frustrated sound that was nearly swallowed up by the sounds of traffic . He must have still been out on the street . “
81533	81534	81484	81484	I	0	” “
81540	81546	81484	81484	I	0	” she said , smiling . “
81552	81710	81484	81484	I	0	” * * * As she prepared for her first date with the man she was in love with , Brontë was thankful that Audrey had dragged her out and made her go clothes shopping . Her own funds were still a little lean , and although working at the coffee shop was a good way to pass time , living in New York was expensive and she found she was constantly a bit strapped for cash . A date outfit would have been out of the question . Luckily , she had the clothes she ’d taken when she ’d left Logan ’s apartment . She grabbed her favorite jeans , paired them with a silver belt , and tossed on a form - fitting black boatneck sweater and some ankle boots . She pulled her hair into a smooth ponytail and added a pair of hoop earrings , and then presented the ensemble to Gretchen . “
81716	81729	81713	81713	I	0	” Gretchen looked up from her laptop screen and squinted at Brontë . “
81735	81736	81737	81737	I	0	” “
81740	81741	81737	81737	I	0	” “
81748	81758	81762	81762	Gretchen	365	” Gretchen said and turned back to her computer . “
81764	81771	81762	81762	Gretchen	365	” Brontë said with a laugh . “
81794	81795	81762	81762	Gretchen	365	” “
81800	81862	81762	81762	Gretchen	365	” Gretchen said with a roll of her eyes . She continued to type , her hair pulled atop her head in a wild red bun . At the side of her computer , Igor curled up , looking like a naked , wrinkly bat . Occasionally , Gretchen would reach over to pet the cat and then return to typing . “
81905	81919	81890	81890	him	175	” Gretchen certainly knew how to get to the heart of the matter . “
81936	81952	81890	81890	him	175	” Gretchen peered up at her again ; then her eyes settled on her chest . “
81959	81960	81890	81890	him	175	” “
81963	81964	81965	81968	A big ugly girdle	1215	” “
81970	81971	81965	81968	A big ugly girdle	1215	” “
81974	81975	81965	81968	A big ugly girdle	1215	” “
81998	82007	82008	82008	I	0	” Brontë smoothed a hand over her sweater . “
82020	82021	82008	82008	I	0	” “
82026	82051	82052	82052	I	0	” Gretchen waved a hand , then returned it to scratching Igor ’s wrinkly skin . She did n’t look away from her monitor . “
82098	82099	82100	82100	Gotcha	95	” “
82102	82103	82100	82100	Gotcha	95	” “
82107	82108	82109	82109	I	0	” “
82112	82113	82109	82109	I	0	” “
82132	82325	82326	82326	You	1217	” Brontë waved , grabbed her purse , and headed out the door . The walk to the subway station was a short one . Even though the network of subway lines was still confusing to her , she knew a few stops and was glad that the one they ’d agreed to meet near was among them . After she emerged from the subway , she headed for the restaurant they ’d picked and scanned the crowd of pedestrians for a familiar set of broad shoulders in an expensive jacket . Her gaze nearly skipped over a tall man in a form - fitting navy henley , and then she paused , gazing at him in surprise . Logan . In jeans and a regular shirt . She continued to stare as he moved to her side , looking just as at ease as ever , and his hand went to her waist to pull her in to his embrace . His scent enveloped her , and she lifted her face for a kiss automatically . But he only hugged her close , then released her . Brontë was oddly disappointed . “
82330	82339	82326	82326	You	1217	” she told him with a small smile . “
82352	82370	82340	82340	I	0	” He grinned down at her , looking boyishly handsome , and it made her pulse pound . “
82411	82427	82403	82403	Audrey	244	” He ran a hand down his front and lifted his chin as if posing . “
82433	82434	82435	82435	You	1217	” “
82438	82446	82447	82447	You	1217	” she said with a small laugh . “
82451	82470	82447	82447	You	1217	” he told her , his gaze devouring her body in the form - fitting sweater and jeans . “
82482	82494	82447	82447	You	1217	” Her breath quickened , and she gave another nervous laugh . “
82502	82533	82447	82447	You	1217	” Logan said , grinning . She could n’t seem to stop smiling . When he offered her his arm , she placed her hand in the crook of it . “
82539	82540	82541	82541	I	0	” “
82555	82556	82541	82541	I	0	” “
82560	82571	82572	82572	I	0	” He looked perplexed for a minute , then grimaced . “
82592	82609	82584	82584	I	0	” He pulled out his phone . She put her hand over his , stopping him . “
82622	82631	82632	82632	I	0	” Logan ’s expression was a bit sheepish . “
82644	82645	82632	82632	I	0	” “
82648	82662	82632	82632	I	0	” They began to walk and Logan guided her through the streaming crowd . “
82702	82706	82707	82707	I	0	” He grimaced . “
82728	82741	82719	82723	The man next to me	1224	” She laughed again , feeling an insane urge to hug him . “
82749	82797	82719	82723	The man next to me	1224	” They walked two blocks , chatting about ridiculous things like the weather , Gretchen ’s obvious dislike of him and her protectiveness of Brontë , Cooper ’s coffee shop , and Audrey ’s efficiency as an assistant . Simple , easy conversation . She loved it . “
82802	82823	82824	82824	I	0	” Logan said , and they stopped outside of a small pizza parlor with an old yellow - lit sign . “
82833	82851	82852	82852	You	1226	” It . . . definitely did n’t look like the regular sort of place Logan frequented . “
82857	82858	82859	82859	I	0	” “
82876	82885	82886	82886	You	1226	” She looked up at him , surprised . “
82890	82891	82892	82892	I	0	” “
82895	82914	82915	82915	I	0	” He stared up at the sign , the expression on his face half fond , half rueful . “
83022	83030	83016	83016	he	1229	” Logan gestured at the pizza parlor . “
83035	83043	83031	83033	A family friend	1233	” she guessed , watching his face . “
83165	83166	83162	83162	I	0	” “
83173	83181	83162	83162	I	0	” She struggled for the right word . “
83184	83185	83162	83162	I	0	” “
83225	83226	83214	83214	you	0	” “
83231	83232	83214	83214	you	0	” “
83235	83243	83244	83244	Andy	143	” Logan said with a half smile . “
83378	83389	83368	83368	I	0	” He stared up at the pizza sign fondly again . “
83392	83414	83415	83415	You	1245	” Brontë nodded , fascinated by the story he ’d told her . It gave her a lot to think about . “
83427	83428	83425	83425	you	1245	” “
83439	83469	83425	83425	you	1245	” Logan stepped inside and moved to the counter , pointing at one of the pizzas and then holding up two fingers . She waited for him to continue . “
83477	83478	83425	83425	you	1245	” “
83491	83507	83484	83485	Your mother	1526	” He gave her a wry look as he handed a twenty to the cashier . “
83550	83551	83543	83543	She	1526	” “
83557	83580	83581	83581	I	0	” Brontë took her plate and followed Logan to one of the small , dingy tables in the back of the parlor . “
83596	83600	83601	83601	He	1229	” He shrugged . “
83607	83643	83601	83601	He	1229	” And two years ago , Logan had broken off his engagement with Danica . No wonder he had trust issues . Brontë took a small bite , a mix of emotions swirling through her . “
83649	83660	83662	83662	you	0	” she said , changing the subject to safer territory . “
83664	83665	83662	83662	you	0	” “
83673	83688	83689	83689	Babysitter	144	” He took a bite , waiting for her to respond . She grimaced . “
83694	83695	83689	83689	Babysitter	144	” “
83701	83702	83689	83689	Babysitter	144	” “
83735	83739	83740	83740	I	0	” He grinned . “
83749	83750	83751	83751	I	0	” “
83760	83768	83758	83758	I	0	” She smiled impishly back at him . “
83776	83816	83758	83758	I	0	” It was a tough question , but she ’d been expecting it . Brontë chewed , thinking for a long minute . Then she dabbed her mouth with a napkin and gave him the only answer she could . “
83824	83828	83829	83829	You	0	” He nodded . “
83831	83840	83829	83829	You	0	” Logan ’s eyes were on her again . “
83861	84053	83851	83851	I	0	” Brontë ’s nervous giggle surprised neither of them . * * * The only movie that they could get tickets to was an action movie , but sitting in the dark with Logan was pleasant no matter what the flick . Though the movie theater was crowded , she still enjoyed herself , and spent half of the movie with her head on Logan ’s shoulder , waiting for him to make a move . After all , date movies were for making out , were n’t they ? Except he did n’t , and when they walked back to the subway , Brontë was a little confused . Their date had gone so well . She ’d found out so much about him and been so comfortable with Logan tonight , but he was keeping it platonic . Extremely platonic . And she did n’t know how to handle that . After all , they ’d been intimate before . Extremely intimate . Since it was late , he walked her back to Gretchen ’s apartment building , and they stood on the stoop , gazing at each other . “
84065	84087	83851	83851	I	0	” Brontë asked . Logan looked up at her with a slow , assessing gaze , and then shook his head . “
84091	84092	83851	83851	I	0	” “
84096	84105	84106	84106	I	0	” She flushed at how forward that sounded . “
84120	84121	84118	84118	I	0	” “
84124	84155	84118	84118	I	0	” Logan said in a soft voice , hushing her . He stepped closer , and his hand moving to her waist , tugging her a little closer to him . “
84183	84195	84196	84196	Logan	175	” Her entire body felt suffused with heat at his words . “
84200	84201	84198	84198	I	0	” “
84208	84212	84198	84198	I	0	” he said . “
84265	84289	84257	84257	we	1255	” He took her hand in his , and then raised it to his lips , pressing a light kiss to her knuckles . “
84362	84381	84382	84382	I	0	” So direct and to the point . She felt breathless , gazing up into his serious face . “
84394	84410	84382	84382	I	0	” she told him honestly . He pressed another kiss to her knuckles and smiled . “
84423	84424	84425	84425	I	0	” “
84439	84443	84435	84435	I	0	” she began . “
84446	84451	84435	84435	I	0	” he said patiently . “
84467	84492	84493	84493	I	0	” He had a point . She was just pushing to see if she could win , and it was n’t fair to him . “
84506	84507	84510	84510	you	1252	” “
84512	84564	84510	84510	you	1252	” At this rate , she was never going to stop blushing . He made her feel . . . a little excited , but strangely pleased . She rather liked being the center of his universe , even if at the moment his universe consisted of small , easy dates . “
84574	84575	84510	84510	you	1252	” “
84583	84589	84510	84510	you	1252	” Excitement flared through her . “
84626	84627	84510	84510	you	1252	” “
84643	84650	84634	84634	I	0	” He reluctantly released her hand . “
84656	84657	84658	84658	I	0	” “
84666	84811	84664	84664	Logan	175	” She watched him descend the steps of her building and head back down the street to the subway . He did n’t look back at her , but that was okay . Her entire body was still warm from his words . What do you want to do , then ? Be with you . . . Think of me tonight . Strange how admitting that she would think of him somehow felt more intimate than a dozen kisses . Brontë went inside , heading up to the apartment . Gretchen had n’t moved from the space she ’d occupied when Brontë had left hours earlier , except her bun now had several pencils stuck into it , and the cat had moved to curl around her feet . She looked up at Brontë as if surprised , then glanced at the clock . “
84820	84832	84664	84664	Logan	175	” She rubbed her eyes and stared at her computer screen . “
84850	84851	84664	84664	Logan	175	” “
84854	84862	84664	84664	Logan	175	” Brontë said with a dreamy sigh . “
84875	84876	84866	84866	I	0	” “
84884	84894	84895	84895	I	0	” Gretchen said , reaching down to pet Igor . “
84909	84915	84895	84895	I	0	” Brontë made a face . “
84927	84928	84919	84919	We	1258	” “
84951	84960	84944	84944	I	0	” She stared at the screen and grimaced . “
84974	84978	84944	84944	I	0	” Brontë snorted . “
84994	85004	85006	85006	you	1257	” Gretchen did n’t look up from the screen . “
85008	85535	85006	85006	you	1257	” Brontë went to bed , and just like she ’d promised , her thoughts were entirely of Logan . * * * The next night , Logan took her out to a popular Broadway show , and she had an amazing time . She did n’t even raise an eyebrow when he produced box seats instead of ones in the nosebleed section . Afterward , they went out for drinks and spent the evening talking and laughing together . She told him about her childhood in the Midwest , and he told her about his adventures at boarding school as a boy . When they parted that night , he simply given her a hug and a kiss on the cheek . The next night , he took her ice skating at Rockefeller , determined to show her a good time even if it meant hitting every tourist hot spot that New York had to offer . She did n’t care , though . She loved the sheer fun of being out with him , seeing all the famous places around town . Holding hands with him as they careened around the ice . She laughed the entire time , and even Logan ’s serious face had a smile on it . Of course , that night , he gave her just a caress on the cheek and a quick peck before leaving her on the stoop , her pulse throbbing with unfulfilled desire . She knew he was doing it on purpose , of course . If she wanted to have a few dates just as a normal couple , they ’d take it slow . Extremely slow . That had been her plan , after all . A week or two of just dating . Unfortunately for her , the plan was backfiring in a major way . By the time they went on a walk through Central Park two days later , his every touch sent a ripple of desire through her body . Her nipples were hard enough at his nearness that she wore several layers of clothing to cover it up . And when he leaned in to nuzzle the nape of her neck in a quietly affectionate move , her knees went weak , her sex instantly wet . This was not exactly how she ’d planned for the week to go . She said nothing , of course , though she might have rubbed up against Logan ’s thigh a bit more than she should have in the carriage ride around the park , and when he held her close , she might have pushed her hips back suggestively . Her skin was heated and flushed with need , but he only gave her a light kiss on the lips . If this is how he thinks normal people date , she thought wryly , he is going to be very surprised when I jump his bones in the next date or two . She had wanted to move slow with Logan to prove that the real spark was there between them . However , he had apparently interpreted “
85537	85539	85006	85006	you	1257	” as “
85542	85621	85006	85006	you	1257	” She could n’t really complain , though . His schedule kept him busy in the daytime , though he ’d send her occasional text messages throughout the day to let her know what their plans were for that evening , or simply to tell her he was thinking about her . When she ’d told him she was looking forward to their date , he ’d sent back a quote that made her heart flutter with delight . “
85692	85978	85681	85681	I	0	” She ’d been giddy over that single text . She had n’t even corrected him considering that was a quote from a satire of love . It was meant from the heart from Logan , and that was all that counted . Meanwhile Gretchen , who was still on deadline and crankier than ever , complained that Brontë was too easily swayed . And maybe it was true . But she knew it was love . At least , it was on her end . Love and desire and need and want all mixed into one giant bundle of nerves . And while she knew it was love , she also knew one other thing for certain . She was n’t going to be the one to say it first . Not this time . Chapter Twelve Logan told Brontë to ask Cooper for the day off on Monday . She asked , with a bemused smile on her face . Cooper was confused about the situation , of course . Since Logan was in the process of buying the coffee shop , and she was dating Logan , did she really have to ask Cooper ? Yes , Brontë informed him . She did . She got the day off , of course . When Logan showed up with the limo , she should have been mad at him , but he had such a I - know - I’ve - been - bad smile on his face that she could n’t get upset . Instead , she eyed the car and then his clothing , noting that despite the expensive wheels , he was dressed down in jeans and a ribbed sweater . “
85985	85986	85681	85681	I	0	” “
85999	86014	86015	86015	We	1265	” She crossed her arms but could n’t keep the smile off her face . “
86020	86021	86022	86022	We	1265	” “
86025	86034	86022	86022	We	1265	” he agreed , and produced a blindfold . “
86050	86062	86022	86022	We	1265	” Skeptical , Brontë took the length of fabric from him . “
86065	86066	86022	86022	We	1265	” “
86072	86136	86022	86022	We	1265	” He took it from her and gestured for her to turn around . Obediently , she turned , biting back her smile . She could feel his fingers moving over the back of her head , and skitters of delight moved through her at even that simple touch . When his hand clasped her arm , she jumped in surprise , gasping . “
86142	86143	86138	86138	I	0	” “
86151	86162	86146	86146	I	0	” Her nipples were hard , though . Embarrassingly so . “
86172	86173	86166	86166	I	0	” “
86179	86402	86404	86404	we	1268	” he told her , and then led her into the limo . It was impossible to tell how far they were driving — she could n’t see a clock or see the streets to know where they were headed . Her entire world became the interior of the car and , more precisely , Logan ’s large body next to hers in the backseat , his thigh warm next to her own . Her senses were enveloped with his nearness , and just the occasional whiff of his aftershave was driving her wild with need . When he put an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close , she tilted her head back , hoping he would kiss her . Instead , his thumb lightly traced the contours of her lips . The tender touch sent sensations cascading through her , and Brontë could barely breathe for the ache in her breast . . . and between her legs . God , she needed him . This was torture . Her breasts yearned for his touch , and her entire body felt attuned to him . Without the ability to see , all her other senses seemed to have come alive , and she was on fire with longing . The car stopped , and Logan shifted next to her . “
86407	86415	86404	86404	we	1268	” Her voice was breathless and husky . “
86419	86437	86404	86404	we	1268	” Logan said . He took her hand in his and led her out of the car . “
86449	86487	86404	86404	we	1268	” Brontë tilted her head , wishing she could see his expression . She listened to the sounds around her — lots of people . Outdoors . But where ? She was n’t familiar with the city . “
86495	86496	86404	86404	we	1268	” “
86499	86578	86404	86404	we	1268	” he said , and his hands moved to her hair . He untied the knot , and she caught the blindfold in her hands , tugging it down off of her face , eyes open - wide to interpret what she was seeing . People everywhere . A park with tall trees , and a large brick wall . Signs stood by the entrance , and she quickly scanned one . One gave ferry rates . . . “
86584	86602	86582	86582	Liberty	146	” she gasped , delighted . Brontë turned back to Logan , unable to contain her smile . “
86610	86611	86582	86582	Liberty	146	” “
86615	86623	86582	86582	Liberty	146	” He looked pleased at her response . “
86627	86747	86582	86582	Liberty	146	” It was the most ridiculously touristy thing they ’d done so far , but she loved every moment of it . They rode the ferry across the water to Ellis Island and the museum . Logan held her hand in his as they walked the grounds , their headsets on as they shuffled along listening to the tour . They stopped by the gift shop , and she got a Statue of Liberty T - shirt , postcards , and several pens for her friends back home . Once she ’d finished her shopping , they went on to Liberty Island . The Statue was fascinating , and she stared up at it with wide eyes , delighted . “
86754	86758	86759	86759	I	0	” He asked . “
86777	86785	86789	86790	one together	1272	” She nodded , beaming at him . “
86792	86793	86789	86790	one together	1272	” “
86797	86833	86789	86790	one together	1272	” They took pictures in front of the Statue , pausing to switch off so they could both have photos on their individual phones . Brontë laughed at the sight of them in one shot . “
86851	86852	86844	86844	We	1273	” “
86862	87002	86844	86844	We	1273	” he said , and took the phone from her , holding it low so the picture would be an uptilted view . And he leaned in and very lightly kissed her mouth . Immediate heat flushed through her body . Brontë clung to him , her hands going to his cheeks and anchoring her mouth against his . She ’d wanted this for what felt like forever , and when his lips parted , she took advantage and swept her tongue into his mouth , letting him know her need . He groaned low in his throat at her kiss , and then his tongue was rubbing up against hers . An ache settled low in Brontë ’s hips , and she whimpered in response . Logan slowly pulled away from her lips and grinned down at her . “
87011	87045	86844	86844	We	1273	” Dazed , she stared up at him , and reached out to take the phone back . The photo was tilted awkwardly , and the Statue was n’t even in the picture . “
87050	87059	86844	86844	We	1273	” she murmured , still flushed and tingling . “
87071	87184	87064	87064	We	1274	” he said , and his hand went around her waist as he took the phone back from her . He angled it up once more , adjusted it , then leaned in and began to kiss her again . The kiss this time did n’t start off delicate . His mouth immediately claimed hers , sending driving desire rocketing through her . Over and over , his mouth slanted over hers , tongue licking at hers in a way that made her knees weak . People were probably watching , and she did n’t care . She nearly sagged when he released her again , and glanced down at the phone . “
87187	87199	87200	87200	My	0	” She asked in a wobbly voice , clinging to him . “
87206	87221	87200	87200	My	0	” he said , and could n’t hide the triumphant expression on his face . “
87230	87231	87232	87232	I	0	” “
87244	87407	87232	87232	I	0	” Brontë protested , but her words were cut off by the heated kiss he bestowed on her mouth again . And oh , God , desire was hammering staccato notes through her body , and all her nerve endings seemed to be demanding one thing . His body , over hers . In hers . ASAP . All this dating and yearning seemed like one big cruel tease at the moment . Endless , endless foreplay , she thought , lost in the feel of his mouth against hers . A low moan almost escaped her when he pulled away , but she bit it back . His gaze moved over her face with that same heated look that she was positive was plastered all over her own face . She licked her lips and nearly moaned again , because she could taste him on her skin . Logan glanced down at her phone , and then handed it to her . “
87410	87486	87487	87487	I	0	” Dazed , Brontë stared down at the picture . A hot flush crept over her cheeks — in the photo , she was clinging to Logan , the two of them wrapped around each other , the Statue looming in the distance . She loved that picture . He leaned in and her breath caught . She stared up at him , hoping for another kiss , but his mouth moved to her ear . “
87491	87515	87487	87487	I	0	” he told her . And he bit her earlobe . She did moan then , the sound low and full of longing . “
87522	87540	87517	87517	we	1276	” he asked her , still nibbling on her ear and making her bones turn to liquid . “
87556	87557	87560	87560	my	0	” “
87563	87567	87569	87569	yours	0	” she breathed . “
87571	87572	87569	87569	yours	0	” “
87580	87581	87577	87578	Your roommate	1627	” “
87585	87611	87577	87578	Your roommate	1627	” Brontë told him , and was suddenly wildly thankful that Gretchen had a job of some kind that got her out of the apartment . “
87615	87616	87577	87578	Your roommate	1627	” “
87619	88293	87577	87578	Your roommate	1627	” he told her , and the sound was full of so much satisfaction and promise that she went weak in the knees all over again . Brontë clung to him on the ferry ride back to Battery Park . His arms were wrapped around her , and she had gone all too easily into his embrace . Waiting to get back to the apartment was a slow , delicious torture , but it gave her time to think . . . and stew in her own thoughts . He ’d taken her out to Liberty Island to see the Statue . Brontë thought of her comment on the plane ride to New York . She ’d asked him about seeing the Statue and teased him about how clichéd it was and how she still wanted to do it . Such a small , offhand comment , but he ’d remembered it . He ’d remembered that she loved sightseeing and had wanted to see the city , and had taken her on a tour of New York City with every date . Even when Logan was deliberate , he was thoughtful . And he ’d completely stolen her heart . Gretchen had warned her about falling too fast all over again , but this was Logan . Her Logan . Warm and delicious and handsome and thoughtful . . . And totally loaded . And all wrong for a poor Midwestern waitress . Well , she would n’t worry about that right now . They were heading back to her apartment she shared temporarily with Gretchen , and they were going to make love . Her body thrummed and ached with need for him . He had n’t told her he loved her , though . She would n’t tell him she loved him , either . This , she told herself , was just mutual using . Both parties seeking satisfaction . No emotions had to be involved , really . It was just the natural progression of a normal relationship , after all . It sounded totally convincing in her head . Truth was , their relationship had never been all that normal . From the moment she ’d met Logan until now , it seemed they ’d done everything half backward and sideways . He was n’t the right guy for her in the long run , she told herself . No billionaire could see himself with a waitress long - term . Those sorts of things were generally pretty incompatible . But she could enjoy him while she had him . And she would . She would think about the future some other time . * * * Logan rubbed Brontë ’s shoulder as she leaned against him in the car . The drive to Gretchen ’s apartment was fucking endless , and his entire body sang with a need to pull Brontë into his lap , tear down her panties , and drive into her . But he had to be patient . She was calling the shots for now , because she needed to feel comfortable again . That was why they were going all the way across town to Gretchen ’s apartment instead of heading to his place on the Upper East Side . Brontë was in control . At least until he got her naked and squirming under him . Then he was taking control , and he ’d make sure she was screaming her pleasure before he even thought about his own . He nearly swore with relief when the apartment building came into sight . He opened the door , got out , and then held the door for Brontë . He gave the driver a nod , signaling that he would n’t need his services for the rest of the evening , and then wrapped his arm around Brontë ’s waist again . She stared up at him with a soft , passion - dazed expression that made his cock hard . “
88299	88300	88301	88301	I	0	” “
88308	88464	88301	88301	I	0	” He met her gaze , almost daring her to contradict him and send him home with a peck on the cheek — like he ’d been doing to her — and a raging hard - on . He forced himself to be patient as Brontë fumbled with the keys , and then they climbed the stairs of the walk - up . By the time they got to Gretchen ’s floor , he was pretty sure he would kill Audrey ’s sister if they opened the door and found her standing there . His cock was so hard he ached , and he ’d just spent four flights of stairs gazing up at Brontë ’s perfect ass as it flexed with every step . To his relief , the apartment was dark . Brontë flipped on a light when they entered , and a wrinkly gray animal darted across the room , startling Logan . “
88469	88488	88301	88301	I	0	” Brontë seemed amused by his reaction , her laughter chasing away the soft desire in her face . “
88499	88525	88493	88493	He	1280	” He glanced at the animal , which seemed to be all ears and wrinkles . It stared back at him with wide golden eyes . “
88528	88529	88493	88493	He	1280	” “
88538	88545	88493	88493	He	1280	” she agreed with a smile . “
88556	88557	88558	88558	I	0	” “
88561	88758	88558	88558	I	0	” she said , and her voice had gone all breathy again . She bent low and snapped her fingers , and the cat darted over to her . Brontë scooped it up in her arms and disappeared into a side room , returning a moment later and shutting the door behind her . Her cheeks were flushed as if she ’d been running . . . or was aroused . The anticipation was getting to her . Good . Because it was driving him mad . Had been for the past week . Brontë was gazing up at him , her eyes shining with a look that seemed half expectant , half anxious . Her expression was so full of emotion that it was driving him wild . . . and tormenting him . There was hurt in her eyes — hurt that he ’d put there . And a little bit of fear that she might get hurt again . They needed to move past that moment . And he had an idea of how to do that . He pulled the blindfold back out of his pocket again and offered it to her . “
88766	88789	88790	88790	I	0	” Her eyes widened as she looked down at it , then up at him , realizing what was about to happen . “
88798	88799	88794	88794	Logan	175	” “
88805	88810	88800	88800	You	1283	” he told her . “
88820	88853	88800	88800	You	1283	” She nodded , swallowing , and then her entire face seemed to flush red as she took the blindfold from his hand with trembling fingers and lifted it to her eyes . “
88859	88913	88800	88800	You	1283	” An innocent question , but it fired his blood . He moved behind her , taking the ends of the blindfold from her and tying them against the back of her head . She was standing there , stiff and wooden , so he leaned in and whispered huskily in her ear . “
88917	88929	88800	88800	You	1283	” She jumped , her elbow nearly slamming into his jaw . “
88938	88945	88800	88800	You	1283	” Her hands reached for him . “
88953	88971	88800	88800	You	1283	” She turned and grasped his jacket in her hands and then gave it a small tug . “
88979	88980	88981	88981	I	0	” “
88987	89272	88981	88981	I	0	” he told her , and swept her into his arms , enjoying the muffled sound of surprise she made and the way she clung to him . Desire surged through him , mixing with triumph . He ’d won her back . She was in his arms , and he was going to make love to her and show her that he ’d never wavered . His arms tightened around her possessively . Brontë was his again . Good . He pushed open the door to the other bedroom . Brontë ’s room . There was a single twin bed in the corner of the room with a plain wrought iron headboard , and a small dresser that held a few mementos from their dates that week . A vase of flowers — flowers that he ’d given her — sat in the windowsill . There were no pictures on the walls , and the entire room seemed barely lived in . The realization pleased him — she’d be back with him after tonight . His place felt empty and lonely without her . Logan gently laid her on the bed and admired her , the curves of her body , the beauty of her face , the way the ends of her hair curled wildly . The way she bit her lip as she anticipated his touch . Carefully , almost reverently , he brushed his fingers down the length of one denim - clad leg and enjoyed seeing her shiver in response . He turned and shut the door to Brontë ’s small room , just in case her roommate did show up again , and she jumped at the sound . “
89277	89289	89290	89290	I	0	” he asked her . A nervous giggle was his answer . “
89303	89304	89290	89290	I	0	” “
89317	89349	89290	89290	I	0	” Logan murmured . His hands went to one of her shoes and eased it off her foot , and he smiled at the way she wiggled her toes in response . “
89370	89371	89374	89374	you	1286	” “
89377	89456	89457	89457	You	1286	” she asked breathlessly . He took her hand and placed it on his cock . That quick caress had him nearly groaning aloud at her touch . His cock felt like steel and ached with the need to bury itself into her , but he would pace himself . Her fingers lightly glided along his shaft , exploring and feeling him . She licked her lips , the unconscious move making his cock jerk in her hand . “
89470	89479	89462	89462	Logan	175	” And she was so delicate under his . “
89483	89521	89522	89522	I	0	” he murmured , leaning in to kiss her lips . She made a small noise of protest when he kept the kiss brief , automatically reaching for him again and stroking her hands down his cheeks . “
89526	89527	89522	89522	I	0	” “
89543	89552	89539	89539	me	0	” She shuddered at his words and nodded . “
89562	89607	89555	89555	I	0	” he said in a low , seductive voice , intending to seduce her with words as well as touch . Her hands automatically moved to the waist of her jeans as if to help out , and he caught her hands in his . “
89611	89632	89609	89609	me	0	” Her hands fluttered at her waist , as if uncertain , and then she dropped them to her sides . “
89635	89670	89671	89671	I	0	” Logan leaned in and pushed her sweater up , exposing an inch of skin above the waist of her jeans . He kissed the skin , enjoying her shiver of pleasure beneath him . “
89702	89731	89696	89696	I	0	” She sucked in a breath . At her sides , her hands clenched and then flexed , as if she did n’t know where to put them . “
89735	89753	89696	89696	I	0	” he told her with a small grin , knowing that she ’d never be able to . “
89758	89766	89696	89696	I	0	” she said with a small laugh . “
89773	89774	89696	89696	I	0	” “
89778	89833	89696	89696	I	0	” he agreed , undoing the button of her jeans and then lowering the zipper with excruciating slowness . His cock throbbed at the sight of the sliver of pale blue satin exposed . His mouth lowered , and he nipped at her skin through the satin , enjoying her small jerk of response . “
89838	89839	89840	89840	My	0	” “
89846	89850	89840	89840	My	0	” she teased . “
89853	89936	89840	89840	My	0	” he teased back . He tugged the thick fabric of the jeans down her legs , tossing them aside and on the floor when he was done . Her socks went next , each one carefully removed with a light skimming of fingers over her flesh . Now her sweater . There were no buttons that he could lovingly pull apart . Shame . He slid a hand under the soft fabric , caressing her belly . She squirmed , ticklish . “
89940	89941	89840	89840	My	0	” “
89946	89974	89840	89840	My	0	” His fingertip dipped into her belly button . Brontë sucked in a breath , and when his tongue followed the finger , she moaned in response . “
89987	89988	89982	89982	I	0	” “
89991	90102	89982	89982	I	0	” he murmured , swirling his tongue around the edge of her belly button as he pushed her sweater upward . Ah , damn . She ’d worn a matching bra . The cups were the same ice blue satin decorated with little black bits of lace around the edges and between her breasts . He ’d wanted to see her naked right away , but the sight of her curves cupped in that gorgeous lingerie made him rethink his idea . He ’d leave her in it a bit longer , and then strip it off of her later . But for now , her sweater had to go . “
90105	90135	89982	89982	I	0	” he asked her , sitting upright again . Her forehead furrowed over the blindfold , and she lifted her hands in the air after a moment ’s hesitation . “
90139	90140	89982	89982	I	0	” “
90143	90171	90172	90172	You	1288	” He tugged her sweater over her head and arms in a deft move and tossed it aside , pleased at the sight of her beautiful body . “
90190	90211	90176	90176	I	0	” A soft smile touched her mouth , and she reached for him , brushing her fingers through his hair . “
90222	90223	90212	90212	I	0	” “
90234	90244	90246	90246	you	1288	” he said , clasping her hands in his . “
90255	90294	90246	90246	you	1288	” She did a mock pout that made him want to lean down and kiss her mouth . Instead , he took her hands and directed them over her head , to the wrought iron headboard ’s bars . “
90299	90304	90305	90305	I	0	” he instructed her . “
90315	90444	90305	90305	I	0	” He was pleased to see the little shiver move over her body at the thought . She obeyed him , her breathing quickening with excitement . Logan skimmed a hand down her leg , caressing the skin . The front of her thigh was smooth and soft , her calves dainty and her ankles elegant . He could indeed spend all day admiring her body . He ran a finger along her skin , tracing a light pattern over her from foot to thigh , noticing how she reacted when he touched her . She jumped when he moved over her thighs , and he repeated the motion , this time skimming the inside of her thigh , and was pleased to see her twitch even more . “
90457	90462	90305	90305	I	0	” she quoted suddenly . “
90465	90466	90467	90467	I	0	” “
90479	90483	90467	90467	I	0	” Logan chuckled . “
90503	90514	90515	90515	Plato	65	” His fingers played along the lace of her panties . “
90517	90528	90529	90530	Sextus Propertius	148	” he asked innocently . Her lips quirked with amusement . “
90535	90536	90532	90532	I	0	” “
90540	90563	90532	90532	I	0	” he commented . His fingers grasped her thighs , and he pulled them apart , eliciting a startled gasp from her . “
90583	90657	90572	90572	I	0	” A whimper escaped her throat , but she did as he ’d commanded , her knees falling open , her legs spread wide on the bed . He pushed them apart until they were flat on the mattress , the ice blue panties totally exposed . She was so wet that he could see it seeping through the fabric of her panties , and he palmed his cock in response , groaning . “
90672	90746	90747	90747	Logan	175	” A shudder rippled through her , and she moaned , clutching at the iron headboard . He watched with fascination as her thighs quivered , as if desperate to lock together again . He ran a curious finger down the inside of her thigh , starting at her knee and moving toward her sex . She seemed to shudder with every inch caressed , until her hips were rolling on the bed . “
90749	90763	90747	90747	Logan	175	” she breathed , her head turning back and forth despite the blindfold . “
90767	90768	90747	90747	Logan	175	” “
90775	90786	90771	90771	I	0	” He brushed a knuckle over her belly button again . “
90789	90790	90771	90771	I	0	” “
90793	90803	90771	90771	I	0	” He went to her knee and caressed it . “
90806	90812	90813	90813	You	175	” She moaned in frustration . “
90819	90820	90813	90813	You	175	” “
90825	90829	90813	90813	You	175	” he chided . “
90847	90885	90837	90837	I	0	” And he stroked one finger up the damp satin between her legs . Brontë ’s sucked - in breath was audible . He pushed his finger , nudging at the clit under the layers of clothing . “
90926	90961	90917	90917	I	0	” Her hips bucked against his hand , trying to create friction between his fingers and her flesh . Naughty woman . He spanked her sex lightly in reproach , enjoying her startled gasp . “
90970	90971	90972	90972	I	0	” “
90983	91156	90972	90972	I	0	” she panted . Her body shifted on the bed , about as close to squirming as she could get away with . Her hips wriggled under his hand , still resting atop her sex . He let it remain there a moment , a silent tease , before he removed it . A small protest escaped her throat . It died when his knuckles brushed over the tip of one of her breasts . He could tell they were hard and tight through the fabric of the pretty bra . Tight and needing , and probably delectable . Logan ’s mouth watered just thinking about how she ’d taste in his mouth , and he tugged at the cups of her bra , freeing her breasts . The underwire of the bra pushed her breasts upward , plumping them as if offering them to his lips . And who was he to refuse such an offering ? Logan bent forward and took one succulent tip in his mouth . Brontë moaned . “
91159	91263	91266	91266	Logan	175	” he murmured against her skin , rolling the tip of her nipple against his lips . Such a hard little nub . He flicked his tongue against it . He loved her nipples — a dusky rose , slightly tilted . Dark and pretty against all that creamy flesh . He began to tease the other with his fingertips as he tongued the first , flicking and teasing it with his mouth . Underneath him , Brontë whimpered , her hips undulating again . Her hands clenched the iron headboard tight , as if she needed to hold on to something desperately . “
91268	91317	91266	91266	Logan	175	” He kissed her flesh — the tips of each breast , the sweet valley between them , the gentle curves underneath them . She moaned wildly with each caress , her blindfolded head moving back and forth , as if in denial . And so he paused . “
91320	91341	91344	91344	Logan	175	” she demanded , arching her back so her breasts were thrust oh - so - beautifully into his face . “
91346	91347	91344	91344	Logan	175	” “
91353	91408	91409	91409	Logan	175	” he murmured , kissing one nipple and then sitting up . His cock strained against his pants , so fucking eager that he could feel pre - come beading on the thick crown . He stood and began to remove his pants , desperate to free his cock . She whimpered , confused . “
91416	91417	91409	91409	Logan	175	” “
91422	91427	91409	91409	Logan	175	” he told her . “
91447	91468	91469	91469	I	0	” A smile curved her lips , and she licked them , which nearly made him come in his pants . “
91474	91475	91477	91477	you	175	” “
91481	91516	91477	91477	you	175	” He stripped off the rest of his clothing , kicking it onto the floor before kneeling back alongside her again . His cock thrust into the air , hard , the head slick . “
91521	91661	91477	91477	you	175	” she said with a small sigh of delight . He wrapped a hand around his cock , stroking it while looking at her lying in the bed , legs spread for him , panties wet , her breasts thrust up . Her head was tilted slightly , as if she were listening for his movements since she could n’t see him . Logan moved back over her , leaning in to kiss her mouth . His hand went to her breast , palming it , and he settled between her legs . She responded to his kisses eagerly , her tongue meeting his and rubbing against it with soft mews of desire . He moved down a little , settling his cock against her wet core and thrusting . She gasped , her hips rocking against his flesh . “
91665	91693	91477	91477	you	175	” he asked her , thrusting his cock against her sex again . The wet fabric prevented him from pushing deep inside her , a teasing barrier . “
91700	91704	91705	91705	Logan	175	” she moaned . “
91719	91787	91788	91788	I	0	” He wanted to be there , too . But he was n’t done playing . He thrust again , enjoying her moans of response . When she parted her lips and licked them again , a mental image formed in his mind that made him groan aloud . He had to get up . She whimpered a protest , turning her head and looking for him . “
91792	91836	91788	91788	I	0	” he told her , standing by the head of the bed . He caressed her breasts , plucking at the nipples . Then , he ran a thumb over her lower lip , unable to resist that mental image in his mind . “
91844	91868	91869	91869	I	0	” Her entire body seemed to tremble with anticipation , and then she took his thumb in her mouth and bit down lightly . “
91873	91874	91869	91869	I	0	” “
91880	91881	91869	91869	I	0	” “
91886	91905	91869	91869	I	0	” He grasped the headboard and leaned forward until the head of his cock pressed against her mouth . “
91910	91996	91869	91869	I	0	” Her lips parted , and she ran her tongue over the head of his cock , licking up the salty pre - come there . He groaned when her tongue slipped down the shaft , flicking against it . Then she opened her mouth and tilted her head , taking him in deeper . The sight of her lips wrapped around his cock was almost enough to send him over the edge , and he clutched at the headboard , trying to keep control . “
91999	92003	92006	92006	God	67	” he groaned . “
92011	92102	92006	92006	God	67	” Her tongue licked against the underside of his cock , running along the thick vein there . So trusting and loving . So incredibly erotic . She sucked , trying to take him deeper , but he pulled out of her mouth . It was too much pleasure too fast , and it would be over with far too quickly if he let her continue . He wanted her to come first . Logan moved a step back from the bed , eyeing her all spread out and delicious . “
92110	92131	92134	92134	Logan	175	” She nodded , biting her lip . Her hips lifted a little , as if unable to stay down . “
92140	92141	92142	92142	I	0	” “
92145	92150	92151	92151	I	0	” he told her . “
92169	92382	92383	92383	Logan	175	” Her little gasp was followed by a low moan , and she obediently turned over , moving to her knees and then leaning forward to rest on her elbows . The position pushed her pretty ass high into the air . Logan ran his hand all over her exposed skin — her thighs , her calves , the small of her back , along her spine . It was a pleasure simply to touch her . She seemed to be enjoying it as well , her little breathy sighs of pleasure almost as enticing as touching her . His fingertips snagged on the waistband of her panties , and he tugged them down her thighs , exposing her wet , gleaming flesh . Brontë moaned again , her fingers curling into the blankets on the bed , anticipation making her entire body tense . Well , now . He had to reward that . Logan brushed his fingertips over the slick lips of her sex , then parted them , stroking up and down . She jerked in surprise , and then a whimper escaped her when he circled the slick opening to her core . She rolled her hips , forcing his fingers to dip in , just a little . “
92385	92389	92383	92383	Logan	175	” she breathed . “
92396	92521	92522	92522	Logan	175	” He moved down to her clitoris , rubbing it between two of his slick fingers and stimulating it . Brontë jerked again , her hips flexing , and her gasps became rapid and wild , as if she were unable to control herself . She worked her hips against his hand , and he continued to rub her clit , then pushed his thumb into her core . She went wild , writhing against his hand and moaning his name as he continued to work her . He could feel her pussy shuddering with each shallow thrust , and he pushed the pad of his thumb forward , increasing the friction even as he continued the measured , steady rubbing of her clitoris . “
92524	92528	92522	92522	Logan	175	” she cried . “
92535	92642	92533	92533	I	0	” Her entire body clenched under him , muscles quivering , and she made a soft , keening sound . Her pussy clenched around his thumb , milking it with the force of her orgasm . He continued to rub , wanting to prolong the pleasure for her , and she continued to make that low keening noise that made his cock throb with wanting her . The orgasm seemed to go on forever , but then Brontë gave one final shudder and sagged against the blankets , resting her cheek against them . Her legs were sprawled , her sex gleaming wet from her pleasure . “
92645	92649	92652	92652	Logan	175	” she breathed . “
92654	92667	92652	92652	Logan	175	” He licked his fingers , tasting her pleasure on his skin . “
92670	92690	92652	92652	Logan	175	” A soft , sated smile curved under the blindfold , and it made his cock jump with need . “
92693	92702	92652	92652	Logan	175	” She stilled , reaching for the blindfold . “
92721	92737	92717	92717	I	0	” He spanked her ass lightly , and her hand flew away from the blindfold . “
92746	92747	92740	92740	I	0	” “
92752	92798	92740	92740	I	0	” He was pleased to see that her hand had slipped between her thighs and she was playing with her flesh , lightly rubbing along her clit . She bit her lip as he waited , watching her . She let her hand slide away . “
92801	92806	92740	92740	I	0	” he told her . “
92816	92902	92811	92811	I	0	” He could see the hot blush stealing over her cheeks under the blindfold , but her hand returned between her legs and began to move slowly again . He watched her , fascinated by the sight of her pleasing herself . His cock jerked with need again . Logan moved behind her on the bed , moving between her spread legs . Her ass was so beautiful , perched in the air , that he could n’t resist running his hands over it again . “
92909	92970	92811	92811	I	0	” She sucked in an excited breath and nodded , as if unable to trust her voice . He thrust into her in one swift move , hands gripping her hips . She jerked in surprise , a choked moan escaping her . He stilled immediately , worried that she ’d been too surprised and he ’d somehow hurt her . “
92973	92974	92811	92811	I	0	” “
92977	92988	92811	92811	I	0	” she moaned , her hips bucking up against him . “
92995	93092	92991	92991	God	67	” He groaned in response to that , thrusting hard again . He ’d wanted to be so controlled in his movements , slowly driving her back up the peak of desire , but it seemed that , sheathed deep in her warmth , he ’d lost all control . His thrusts were rough and wild , his hands gripping her hips to anchor her back against him . And she was out of control , too , pushing back against him to add force to his thrusts , a low scream building in her throat . “
93097	93357	93358	93358	I	0	” he demanded , his voice ragged as he continued to pump into her . Her only response was another muffled scream , and he felt her pussy clench all around him . Logan uttered a curse , trying to retain control , trying to keep his rhythm , to make this as good for her as possible . Make it last until she was mindless with pleasure . Show her how much he fucking loved her and her body . She made a soft sound that was almost like a sob , and then she spasmed around his cock , sucking him tight as she began to come again , her body trembling all over with the force of her passion . He lost control . Thrusting hard into her again , he groaned her name and went over the edge , his own orgasm exploding from his body with a fierce intensity that shocked him . It seemed to go on forever , coming hard and fierce , until it left him as breathless and wrung out as the woman beneath him . Logan pulled out of Brontë , ignoring her small noise of protest , and rolled the condom off , tossing it into a nearby trash can . When he turned around , she was sitting up in bed , her hands pulling at the blindfold . He moved toward her , gently undoing the knot at the back of her head and then leaning in to kiss her when she smiled up at him . “
93362	93371	93372	93372	I	0	” he told her , his voice gruff . “
93376	93383	93372	93372	I	0	” Her smile faltered a little . “
93387	93443	93444	93444	You	0	” She did n’t say it back . For a moment he was surprised , and then angry . And then he chuckled at himself . So this was how she ’d felt when she ’d confessed and he ’d ignored her . Fair enough . It was a good lesson for him to learn . “
93451	93468	93469	93469	I	0	” It was n’t a question . She bit her lip , then shook her head . “
93483	93484	93480	93480	I	0	” “
93515	93531	93507	93507	I	0	” Logan sat down on the edge of the small bed and grabbed the blankets . “
93546	93577	93507	93507	I	0	” Brontë gave a small squeal and shifted on the bed , elbowing him by accident as they tried to make all of their limbs fit in the twin bed . “
93584	93588	93589	93589	We	1291	” she protested . “
93592	93695	93696	93696	Veni	149	” he said with determination , and pulled her hips against him until their bodies were flush . The fit was tight but pleasant , and it allowed him free rein to nibble on her ear . She was already drifting to sleep , though , her eyes drooping with exhaustion , and so he watched her doze off , his mind whirling with thoughts . One particular quotation that he ’d read in another of her books came to mind , though . To test whether she was awake , he leaned in and whispered something sure to get a response . “
93702	93712	93696	93696	Veni	149	” I came , I saw , I conquered . “
93717	93741	93696	93696	Veni	149	” she muttered sleepily , but she smiled and patted him on the arm . He decided to keep the other to himself . “
93756	93996	93696	93696	Veni	149	” It seemed that loving Brontë brought out the philosopher in him as well . Chapter Thirteen The next morning , Brontë woke up to find Logan ’s body curled around hers , and her arm was asleep from being in a cramped position over her head . She lay in bed for a long moment , debating getting up , since there was no way she ’d be able to get out of bed without waking Logan . Sweet , gorgeous Logan . God , she loved him . Terrified of getting hurt again , she ’d chickened out on saying it the night before . But he ’d seemed to understand her fear , and it had n’t bothered him . He ’d just kissed her , and they ’d climbed in to bed together , sleeping in a tangle of limbs because they did n’t want to be parted . She ’d been resting on a spring all night , and her leg was trapped under his , and her arm hung off the bed . It was the best night of sleep she ’d had in a long time . Her bladder was protesting the hour , though , and she sighed and sat up , beginning to extract herself . Logan woke up and kissed her arm before rolling out of bed , yawning and stretching to work out the kinks in his back . “
94001	94007	93696	93696	Veni	149	” He ’d been calling her “
94009	94028	94029	94029	I	0	” all night , she ’d noticed . She liked it , too . Brontë smiled at him . “
94048	94049	94042	94042	She	365	” “
94053	94163	94042	94042	She	365	” he told her , lying back . He grabbed the pillow and tucked it under his head , as if to go back to sleep . She grinned and shook her head at him , then raced for the bathroom . When she returned from her shower , she was surprised to see him up and moving about her room . He ’d dressed in his boxer shorts and had made the bed . Her suitcase lay atop the blankets , and he ’d pulled several of her hung - up clothes out of the closet . Brontë gave him a curious look , holding back her frown . “
94169	94176	94042	94042	She	365	” Logan smiled over at her . “
94191	94192	94185	94185	I	0	” “
94198	94227	94228	94228	We	1294	” She crossed her arms over her towel and tried to look open - minded about what he was going to say . His mouth thinned a little . “
94242	94248	94249	94249	Logan	175	” She shook her head . “
94253	94260	94249	94249	Logan	175	” Frustration flashed in his gaze . “
94269	94291	94267	94267	Brontë	112	” His voice sounded as if he were trying to be patient . . . and it were causing him pain . “
94328	94329	94267	94267	Brontë	112	” “
94339	94350	94355	94355	Logan	175	” She snorted . Of course he ’d say that . “
94378	94392	94395	94396	someone else	234	” His face hardened as a stark look of disbelief crossed his gaze . “
94398	94405	94395	94396	someone else	234	” His voice was deathly serious . “
94414	94421	94395	94396	someone else	234	” Relief flickered in his eyes . “
94424	94435	94436	94436	I	0	” He moved forward and pulled her into his arms . “
94461	94462	94457	94457	you	1293	” “
94466	94467	94457	94457	you	1293	” “
94477	94489	94457	94457	you	1293	” He sounded so possessive and so utterly sure of himself . “
94502	94517	94498	94498	I	0	” Logan seemed to think about that for a moment and then accepted it . “
94535	94536	94527	94527	I	0	” “
94545	94546	94537	94537	You	1293	” “
94575	94608	94609	94609	I	0	” She tugged her towel a little tighter around her naked body . Being in his bed was no problem . It was being in his life that she was struggling with . “
94623	94654	94655	94655	I	0	” Brontë thought he would protest again , but to her surprise , he moved in and caressed her neck , lifting strands of wet hair off of her skin . “
94663	94675	94660	94660	I	0	” He leaned in and kissed her lightly on the mouth . “
94690	94706	94710	94710	Logan	175	” She trembled at the sweetness of his touch and the understanding in his voice . “
94712	94718	94710	94710	Logan	175	” He kissed her again . “
94725	94726	94727	94727	I	0	” “
94733	94734	94727	94727	I	0	” “
94742	94743	94727	94727	I	0	” “
94746	94753	94727	94727	I	0	” she said with a smile . “
94767	94787	94760	94760	Cooper	135	” Working , mindless as it was , helped keep her mind off of things like her personal life . “
94791	94797	94760	94760	Cooper	135	” He shook his head . “
94803	94804	94799	94799	I	0	” “
94807	94815	94799	94799	I	0	” That was . . . interesting . “
94820	94821	94799	94799	I	0	” “
94824	94829	94830	94830	I	0	” he said abruptly . “
94837	94838	94830	94830	I	0	” “
94842	94847	94830	94830	I	0	” she told him . “
94854	94884	94885	94885	I	0	” Logan gave her a curious look , and then leaned in and kissed her fiercely , as if he ’d just come to some sort of bizarre realization . “
94889	94903	94904	94904	I	0	” A bit surprised , she laughed at his expression . She almost blurted “
94910	94915	94904	94904	I	0	” but stopped herself . “
94921	94938	94939	94939	I	0	” The look he gave her was intense , making her laughter die in her throat . “
94949	94950	94951	94951	You	0	” “
94959	94972	94951	94951	You	0	“ It ’s more of a meeting of . . . friends . ”
94973	94981	94988	94988	he	1298	“ Are you sure that ’s allowed ? ”
94982	94987	94988	94988	he	1298	“ It will be , ”
95393	95399	95379	95379	She	365	“ You ’re here today ? ”
95400	95404	95405	95405	Brontë	112	“ Of course , ”
95414	95421	95405	95405	Brontë	112	“ Why would n’t I be ? ”
95436	95465	95431	95431	Brontë	112	“ Oh , I do n’t know . Could it have something to do with the tall , dark , and rich guy who was over last night ? ”
95466	95489	95431	95431	Brontë	112	“ Why does everyone assume that just because Logan and I sleep together that I automatically decide to shirk all my duties ? ”
95490	95499	95500	95500	Gretchen	365	“ ’Cause that ’s what happened last time ? ”
95540	95545	95546	95546	Gretchen	365	“ Oh , jeez , ”
95567	95576	95546	95546	Gretchen	365	“ I did n’t mean to upset you . ”
95577	95582	95583	95583	Brontë	112	“ It ’s okay , ”
95603	95613	95583	95583	Brontë	112	“ I ’m just all confused on the inside . ”
95614	95649	95650	95650	Brontë	112	“ You want to talk ? I can get us a couple of coffees , and we can steal one of the booths in the back . It ’s kind of slow this morning . ”
95697	95700	95701	95701	Gretchen	365	“ So , ”
95704	95725	95726	95726	Brontë	112	“ You had Mr. Moneypants over last night . It went badly , and that ’s why you ’re crying . ”
95746	95762	95763	95763	Gretchen	365	“ It went great . It was beautiful . He told me he loved me . ”
95767	95785	95786	95786	She	365	“ And this is bad ? Admission of love pre – blow job as incentive , then ? ”
95797	95871	95786	95786	She	365	“ Post – blow job . And no , it ’s not bad . I just do n’t know what to do . I still have an apartment back in Kansas City . A life . Well , such as it is . But this morning , I got out of the shower , and Logan was packing my bags as if sleeping with him meant that I was automatically moving back in . ”
95872	95876	95877	95877	Gretchen	365	“ That bastard , ”
95881	95907	95908	95908	She	365	“ How dare he want to spend all his time with you ? Do you need me to talk to him and set him straight ? ”
95916	95953	95908	95908	She	365	“ I ’m serious . My problem with Logan is that last time we did the exact same thing — we moved in together right away , and he just kind of took over my life . ”
95954	95958	95959	95959	Gretchen	365	“ I see . ”
95965	95971	95959	95959	Gretchen	365	“ Took over like how ? ”
95972	95979	95908	95908	She	365	“ He bought me some clothes . ”
95980	95984	95959	95959	Gretchen	365	“ That bastard . ”
95985	96013	96014	96014	She	365	“ Shut up , Gretchen . I ’m trying to tell you . He bought me clothes , and we went to a party and . . . ”
96019	96027	96014	96014	She	365	“ I bought books for his library . ”
96028	96031	96032	96032	Gretchen	365	“ Well , ”
96036	96051	96052	96052	Brontë	112	“ What a douche bag . How dare he spend his billions on you ? ”
96055	96061	96052	96052	Brontë	112	“ You ’re not helping . ”
96062	96068	96069	96069	Gretchen	365	“ Of course I am , ”
96078	96090	96069	96069	Gretchen	365	“ I ’m making you realize how silly you ’re being . ”
96102	96156	96098	96099	The redhead	112	“ Look . He ’s got so much money he could roll in it . You , meanwhile , count the change in your wallet for a slice of pizza . Is it weird that he wants to shower you with presents and nice things ? Maybe he likes buying them for you . ”
96157	96185	96098	96099	The redhead	112	“ He does n’t like gold diggers , Gretchen . Everyone always uses him for his money . I do n’t want to be like everyone else . ”
96186	96221	96223	96223	Brontë	112	“ Then do n’t be . Do n’t go running off buying a truckful of Birkin bags . Though if you do , remember your bestie , Gretchen , and her sister , Audrey . ”
96232	96254	96229	96229	Gretchen	365	“ Look . It does n’t sound like the problem is his money . It sounds like the problem is you . ”
96255	96258	96098	96099	The redhead	112	“ What ? ”
96259	96309	96229	96229	Gretchen	365	“ As in , Logan does n’t need you . He likes you , he finds you fun , but he does n’t need you to survive . So you do n’t know what to do with yourself . That ’s a little unhealthy , do n’t you think ? ”
96310	96319	96229	96229	Gretchen	365	“ That ’s not the case at all ! ”
96320	96334	96335	96335	Brontë	112	“ No ? What did you do when you moved in with him ? ”
96348	96363	96335	96335	Brontë	112	“ I shopped with Audrey , and then I sat around in his apartment . ”
96364	96381	96382	96382	Gretchen	365	“ Gee , exciting . I ’m amazed he let you get away the first time , ”
96386	96392	96393	96393	Brontë	112	“ Oh , my God , ”
96396	96432	96393	96393	Brontë	112	“ All this time I ’ve been thinking I ca n’t be with him because I ca n’t be who he wants me to be . What if it ’s because I am the problem ? ”
96433	96441	96442	96442	Gretchen	365	“ Well , you are a waitress , ”
96445	96463	96464	96464	She	365	“ It ’s not as if you can continue waitressing if you ’re living with a billionaire . ”
96546	96591	96538	96538	Her	365	“ I do n’t know what to do , Gretchen . If I move in with him again , I worry that I ’m going to turn into one of those women he hates . Sitting around all day spending money and doing nothing . ”
96592	96635	96636	96636	Brontë	112	“ That wo n’t happen . You ’re smart . You ’re constantly spouting ancient wisdom and writing little sayings on customers ’ cups . They love that . Do something with that big philosophizing brain of yours instead of serving coffee . ”
96643	96684	96636	96636	Brontë	112	“ I really wanted to do something with my philosophy degree , you know . Show the world just how wise and intelligent they were in classical times . Make others love the ancients just as much as I do . ”
96685	96734	96735	96735	Gretchen	365	“ Then maybe you should go back to school . Teach . Or write books about ancient philosophers . I know a great editor or two . Or you could set up charity foundations with all of your boyfriend ’s ridiculous money that he wants you to spend . ”
96744	96814	96735	96735	Gretchen	365	“ My point is that the money ’s not a problem . It ’s not an obstacle if you do n’t make it one . If he wants to shower you with money , use it and really make something of yourself , Brontë . Be who you want to be , not just a Midwestern waitress with big dreams . Understand ? You can always pay him back . ”
96841	96856	96836	96836	Brontë	112	“ So if you were me , you ’d move back in with him ? ”
96857	96862	96863	96863	Gretchen	365	“ Hell , no , ”
96866	96892	96893	96893	Brontë	112	“ If I were you , I ’d have killed him in a week . But you ’re wimpy . You ’re great with him . ”
96913	96977	96901	96902	The redhead	112	“ If he makes you happy , do n’t set up obstacles that do n’t have to be there . Love is more important than anything else in the world . Well , almost , but you ’ve got the money thing taken care of already . I ’d kill to have a man look at me the way Logan looks at you . ”
96978	96988	96989	96989	Brontë	112	“ Cooper looks at you that way , Gretchen , ”
97006	97017	97018	97018	she	365	“ I keep hoping he ’ll grow out of it , ”
97022	97052	97018	97018	she	365	“ I like Cooper , but he ’s not the right guy for me . He ’s so . . . normal . Bland . I need someone different . ”
97064	97086	97053	97053	She	365	“ I ’m a bit of a hopeless romantic , you know . Holding out for a hero and all that . ”
97096	97113	97087	97087	Brontë	112	“ You ’ll find the right guy . I ’m sure he ’s out there somewhere . ”
97114	97132	97133	97133	Gretchen	365	“ He might be , or he might just be fictional . Or broke . Or both . ”
97140	97156	97133	97133	Gretchen	365	“ It ’d help if he was half as rich as your boyfriend , though . ”
97881	97890	97871	97871	he	848	“ Is what I ’m wearing all right ? ”
97891	97896	97897	97897	he	848	“ It ’s fine , ”
98058	98066	98047	98048	no one	164	“ Is this where the meeting is ? ”
98067	98077	98080	98080	she	112	“ I ’ll explain everything later . I promise . ”
98288	98294	98274	98275	The man	175	“ She ’s with me , ”
98316	98322	98307	98307	he	175	“ The others are inside . ”
98584	98593	98571	98571	Reese	46	“ What the hell is this , Logan ? ”
98608	98616	98594	98594	Logan	175	“ This is Brontë . My girlfriend . ”
98617	98626	98627	98627	Griffin	47	“ You ca n’t bring your girlfriend to — ”
98690	98703	98679	98679	She	112	“ Why did n’t you tell me you were with the Mafia ? ”
98704	98708	98667	98667	She	112	“ The Mafia ? ”
98731	98737	98720	98720	Brontë	112	“ I do n’t understand . ”
98738	98748	98749	98749	he	175	“ I ’m not with the Mafia , love , ”
98753	98781	98749	98749	he	175	“ But I do need you to understand this if we ’re going to make a life together . These men are my . . . friends . ”
98782	98785	98786	98786	Jonathan	48	“ Logan , ”
98793	98799	98786	98786	Jonathan	48	“ Do n’t you dare . ”
98816	98849	98809	98809	He	175	“ They ’ve been my friends since college . We were in the same fraternity together . We made a pledge to assist each other in business and remain friends for life . ”
98855	98864	98809	98809	He	175	“ Do you understand what I ’m saying ? ”
98865	98871	98872	98872	Reese	46	“ God fucking damn it , ”
98875	98880	98872	98872	Reese	46	“ Leave him alone , ”
98895	98903	98888	98893	the man Brontë did n’t know	1367	“ He has to have his reasons . ”
98932	98945	98927	98927	she	112	“ You ’re college friends ? But why the basement ? Why — ”
98998	99003	98995	98995	She	112	“ A secret society . ”
99004	99008	99009	99009	Logan	175	“ A brotherhood , ”
99012	99023	99009	99009	Logan	175	“ We help each other out , no matter what . ”
99024	99048	99049	99049	Reese	46	“ Hey , I can write down my social security number and my PIN if we ’re giving her all of our information , ”
99066	99071	99060	99060	he	175	“ Do you understand ? ”
99092	99112	99085	99085	Logan	175	“ You scared the shit out of me . I thought you were in the Mafia for a second . ”
99113	99157	99165	99165	he	175	“ This is just as secret , Brontë . If word got out that we had business dealings together , people would be crawling all over us . Feds , auditors , you name it . This is a secret . Our secret . ”
99168	99181	99165	99165	he	175	“ And I ’m trusting you with it . I love you . ”

99365	99372	99373	99373	Griffin	47	“ This is really quite moving , ”
99380	99402	99373	99373	Griffin	47	“ But you seem to forget the implications for the rest of us . We ’re not in love with her . ”
99424	99442	99420	99420	Logan	175	“ You ’re all such close friends — I do n’t want this to be a problem . ”
99443	99447	99448	99448	Jonathan	48	“ Too late , ”
99457	99481	99452	99452	Brontë	112	“ Is there something I can sign that would prove it ? That I can stay quiet ? That you can trust me ? ”
99482	99487	99488	99488	Logan	175	“ A nondisclosure agreement ? ”
99491	99498	99499	99499	she	112	“ Yes , that ’s it , ”
99511	99518	99499	99499	she	112	“ Would a nondisclosure agreement work ? ”
99519	99523	99524	99524	Reese	46	“ It depends , ”
99527	99548	99524	99524	Reese	46	“ Exactly how many other women are we going to be dragging in here and sharing all our secrets with ? ”
99549	99554	99555	99555	Logan	175	“ Only this one , ”
99560	99570	99555	99555	Logan	175	“ I ’m not in love with anyone else . ”
99585	99590	99591	99591	Reese	46	“ Oh , jeez , ”
99594	99605	99591	99591	Reese	46	“ They ’re so cute together I want to puke . ”

99614	99641	99611	99611	Cade	49	“ I ’m happy for you both , Logan and Brontë . Come have a seat . We ’ll get things worked out as we play . ”
99698	99700	99693	99693	she	112	“ invited ”
99705	99711	99712	99712	Logan	175	“ Get an extra chair , ”
99715	99722	99723	99723	Griffin	47	“ There are no extra chairs , ”
99728	99739	99723	99723	Griffin	47	“ There ’s never anyone else down here but us . ”
99740	99754	99755	99755	Logan	175	“ We need to get another chair for in the future , then , ”
99778	99788	99789	99789	she	112	“ I do n’t know how to play poker , ”
99808	99820	99789	99789	she	112	“ And I do n’t think I ’ll be coming back . ”
99827	99853	99821	99821	She	112	“ Just because we ’re a couple does n’t mean we have to be together every moment . This is your time with your friends . ”
99854	99859	99860	99860	Reese	46	“ Marry this one , ”
99869	99875	99876	99876	Logan	175	“ I plan on it , ”
100013	100017	100018	100018	Jonathan	48	“ Drink up , ”
100060	100071	100072	100072	he	175	“ This meeting of the brotherhood is called into session , ”
100237	100246	100231	100231	her	112	“ Quit flirting with my woman , Griffin . ”
100247	100268	100269	100269	Griffin	47	“ I ’m not flirting with her , you Neanderthal . We can discuss mutual interests without it being flirting , ”
100286	100306	100283	100283	Logan	175	“ I ’d believe it if I thought that talking archaeology did n’t give you a hard - on . ”
100356	100378	100341	100341	Logan	175	“ I ’m heading upstairs to chat with Reese and Jonathan , love . We ’ll be back in a moment . ”
100379	100383	100384	100384	she	112	“ All right , ”
100400	100407	100341	100341	Logan	175	“ Do n’t take too long . ”
100408	100426	100427	100427	She	112	“ I wo n’t . We ’re just going to discuss . . . your nondisclosure agreement . ”
100455	100468	100469	100469	He	49	“ I ’d better go and see what they ’re up to . ”
100544	100548	100549	100549	Hunter	112	“ Your friend , ”
100579	100588	100573	100573	He	112	“ The redhead . Tell me about her . ”
100589	100594	100575	100577	an odd man	112	“ You mean Gretchen ? ”
100595	100598	100599	100599	He	112	“ Gretchen . ”
100609	100616	100599	100599	He	112	“ What is her last name ? ”
100617	100627	100573	100573	He	112	“ Why ? How do you know about Gretchen ? ”
100628	100644	100645	100645	Brontë	112	“ I saw her with you the other day . Tell me more about Gretchen . ”
100685	100700	100674	100674	she	112	“ Why should I tell you about Gretchen ? So you can stalk her ? ”
100723	100736	100709	100709	she	112	“ I am an admirer of hers . . . from afar . ”
100737	100742	100743	100743	Brontë	112	“ Like a stalker , ”
100747	100761	100743	100743	Brontë	112	“ Not a stalker . I simply wish to know more about her . ”
100762	100771	100772	100772	she	112	“ That ’s what a stalker would say , ”
100936	100947	100948	100948	Hunter	112	“ Your friend is quite safe from my romantic interests , ”
100952	100962	100948	100948	Hunter	112	“ I simply wish to learn more about her . ”
100963	100966	100967	100967	Brontë	112	“ Oh , ”
100999	101002	101003	101003	she	112	“ Penway , ”
101006	101017	101003	101003	she	112	“ Her last name is Petty . She writes books . ”
101018	101024	101003	101003	she	112	“ What kinds of books ? ”
101025	101035	101036	101036	His	112	“ Books with other people ’s names on them . ”
101058	101062	101063	101063	Brontë	112	“ A ghostwriter ? ”
101075	101088	101063	101063	Brontë	112	“ That ’s right . And Cooper ’s in love with her . ”
101089	101092	101093	101093	He	112	“ Cooper ? ”
101100	101135	101093	101093	He	112	“ It ’s okay , though . He wo n’t make a move . He knows Gretchen is n’t interested in him that way . She wants adventure or a fairy tale or something . ”
101167	101173	101174	101174	she	112	“ Is Logan coming back ? ”
101182	101192	101193	101193	Hunter	112	“ I think I ’m going to be sick . ”
101200	101216	101193	101193	Hunter	112	“ Depends on whether Jonathan and Reese have given him a few black eyes yet . ”
101242	101269	101236	101236	she	112	“ But . . . they . . . I do n’t want them to hurt Logan ! I said I ’d sign the nondisclosure agreement . ”
101270	101286	101287	101287	Hunter	112	“ The agreement takes care of the future . Fists take care of right now , ”
101290	101298	101299	101299	Brontë	112	“ Sit down before you hurt yourself . ”
101329	101347	101348	101348	Hunter	112	“ I need a drink of water , I think . And Logan . I want Logan . ”
101378	101385	101368	101368	he	112	“ Tell me more about Gretchen . ”
101416	101426	101413	101413	she	112	“ Well , she has a cat . . . ”

101550	101556	101557	101557	He	175	“ Dry toast , please ? ”
101562	101567	101557	101557	He	175	“ Coming right up . ”
101678	101682	101664	101664	Logan	175	“ You okay ? ”
101724	101739	101721	101721	she	112	“ My head ’s so fuzzy , it feels like the ground is moving . ”
101740	101743	101721	101721	she	112	“ Huh . ”
101854	101864	101846	101846	she	112	“ Are we . . . are we flying ? ”
101865	101871	101872	101872	Logan	175	“ Do n’t get up , ”
101882	101892	101872	101872	Logan	175	“ Lie down and relax . You ’re hungover . ”
101940	101944	101945	101945	He	175	“ Your face ! ”
101958	101992	101945	101945	He	175	“ Yeah . The guys and I had a little talk . When we land , the nondisclosure agreement will be waiting at my office for you to sign . The others insist . ”
101993	101998	101999	101999	Brontë	112	“ That ’s fine , ”
102008	102016	101999	101999	Brontë	112	“ Whatever gets them off your back . ”
102017	102031	102032	102032	he	175	“ I ’m sorry if you feel I ’m pushing you into it , ”
102040	102051	102052	102052	She	112	“ I know you ’re probably not happy about it . ”
102064	102071	102072	102072	she	112	“ I actually do n’t care , ”
102089	102118	102124	102124	she	112	“ It ’s not a big deal . I would n’t go telling all your secrets anyhow , but if the paperwork makes them feel better . . . ”
102129	102132	102124	102124	she	112	“ Why ? ”
102143	102158	102133	102133	Logan	175	“ I just . . . I guess I expected you to be upset . ”
102176	102186	102167	102167	he	175	“ This is why I love you , Brontë . ”
102209	102214	102194	102194	She	112	“ Rest , love , ”
102235	102245	102194	102194	She	112	“ You have a few hours before we land . ”
102246	102252	102253	102253	she	112	“ Where are we going ? ”
102257	102270	102253	102253	she	112	“ It ’s a surprise . One I think you ’ll enjoy . ”
102322	102340	102315	102315	She	112	“ Come on . We ’ll miss the ferry to Seaturtle Cay if we do n’t hurry . ”
102341	102350	102351	102351	She	112	“ We ’re going back to the resort ? ”
102368	102387	102359	102359	he	175	“ I do n’t understand . Is n’t it wrecked ? How can it be open for business ? ”
102388	102394	102395	102395	he	175	“ It ’s not open , ”
102399	102431	102432	102432	Brontë	112	“ But not all the rooms are destroyed , and I thought you would n’t mind having another look at the place when a hurricane is n’t bearing down on you . ”
102692	102705	102669	102681	a curly - haired man with a swarthy tan and wearing a suit	1402	“ Mr. Hawkings . It is a pleasure to see you here . ”

103038	103045	103046	103046	Luz	158	“ Can we take the stairs ? ”
103053	103070	103071	103071	Brontë	112	“ It is twenty floors up . Are you sure you wish to take the stairs ? ”

103921	103945	103946	103946	She	244	“ If I recall , you told me that you loved the idea . And then you fell over and began to snore . ”
103951	103971	103946	103946	She	244	“ How about asking me when I ’m sober ? I ’m supposed to work for the next week . ”

104630	104633	104634	104634	she	112	“ Sorry , ”
104648	104696	104611	104611	he	175	“ I ’m . . . I wo n’t run again . Not without talking to you first . I just . . . it ’s hard to know where I fit in your world when I ’ve always had trouble even fitting in to my own . ”
104697	104704	104705	104705	Logan	175	“ I know where you fit , ”
104720	104726	104712	104712	He	175	“ Right here , Brontë . ”
104733	104740	104712	104712	He	175	“ I love you , Logan . ”
104741	104748	104749	104749	he	175	“ I love you , too , ”
104761	104788	104749	104749	he	175	“ And I want you to be comfortable with me . If something bothers you , tell me so I can fix it or change it . ”
104789	104849	104712	104712	He	175	“ I think it ’s me more than you , Logan . I thought that if I came to you and did nothing but sit around your house , I ’d turn into one of those women that you hate . I ’d do nothing but spend your money on shoes and purses all day long , like Danica . ”
104850	104914	104915	104915	He	1421	“ It was n’t that Danica spent my money , love . If you dedicated your life to shopping , you would n’t be able to spend all my money . It was that she valued the money more than she valued our relationship . You ’ve never been like that . You never will be . It ’s not in your nature . ”
104928	104941	104915	104915	He	1421	“ That ’s one reason why I fell for you so hard . ”
104942	104951	104952	104952	Brontë	112	“ I might spend some of your money , ”
104974	105093	105094	105094	She	1422	“ I ’ve realized that I was resenting you for my being a waitress , which is stupid . It is n’t your fault I picked a major that would n’t get me anywhere except waiting tables . It was n’t that you wanted me to make something of myself . It ’s that I was n’t happy with who I was . That does n’t change with or without money , really . But Gretchen woke me up , and I realized that only I can make myself satisfied with my career path . All I know is I that being without you made me unhappy even when I was waiting tables again . So . . . ”
105100	105170	105094	105094	She	1422	“ I want to go back to college and get a graduate degree . Or start a charity to donate books to schools and retirement homes like Gretchen does , but on a bigger scale . Or do both . Or all of it . I ’m not sure . But I want to do something with myself . I ’ll get bored sitting around your apartment all day . ”
105178	105219	105094	105094	She	1422	“ Love , I want you to do whatever makes you happy . And if going back to school helps you — or starting a charity — then we ’ll do both . As long as we do it together . ”
105220	105223	105224	105224	She	1422	“ Together . ”
105230	105243	105224	105224	She	1422	“ I ’m sorry I ’ve made this so difficult . I — ”
105244	105247	105248	105248	he	1423	“ Shhh , ”
105252	105278	105224	105224	She	1422	“ You did n’t . You were just frightened , and I tend to be overbearing and controlling . It ’s part of my nature . ”
105279	105283	105284	105284	she	1422	“ It is , ”
105291	105312	105284	105284	she	1422	“ You ’re used to handling the situation . But a girl likes to be asked every now and then . ”
105313	105320	105321	105321	he	1423	“ I promise to ask more , ”
105353	105357	105346	105346	Logan	175	“ Starting now . ”
105417	105425	105426	105426	he	1423	“ I picked the inscription for you , ”
105435	105441	105426	105426	he	1423	“ Do you like it ? ”
105442	105445	105446	105446	She	1422	“ Inscription ? ”
105474	105491	105492	105492	Her	1422	“ ‘ Every heart hears a song , incomplete , until another heart whispers back . ’ ”
105506	105513	105492	105492	Her	1422	“ It ’s beautiful . Ovid ? ”
105514	105519	105520	105520	he	1423	“ Plato , actually , ”
105547	105584	105585	105585	He	1423	“ You ’re my heart , Brontë . I know it feels like such a short time together , but I want to wake up every day with you at my side and in my life . ”
105600	105606	105585	105585	He	1423	“ Will you marry me ? ”
105607	105613	105614	105614	she	1422	“ Of course I will , ”
105624	105631	105614	105614	she	1422	“ I love you so much . ”
105632	105639	105640	105640	Logan	175	“ I love you , too , ”
105644	105668	105640	105640	Logan	175	“ Waitress , philosopher , or charitable organizer , I ’ll love you all the same as long as you ’ll be mine . ”
