1090	1096	1075	1075	he	213	“ Come here , Eva . ”

1276	1281	1256	1256	Gideon	1324	“ I catch you . ”
1452	1480	1445	1445	He	1324	“ You ca n’t smile at me like that , then walk away . Tell me what you were thinking about when I was on the phone . ”
1486	1510	1481	1481	My	75	“ How gorgeous you are . It ’s sickening how often I think about that . I need to get over it already . ”
1549	1557	1537	1537	He	1324	“ Damned if I ’ll let you . ”
1558	1561	1569	1569	my	75	“ Oh ? ”
1579	1603	1569	1569	my	75	“ You ca n’t tell me you want another starry - eyed woman hanging on you , Mr. Hates - Exaggerated - Expectations . ”
1604	1609	1610	1610	he	1324	“ What I want , ”
1628	1643	1610	1610	he	1324	“ is you being too busy thinking about me to think about anyone else . ”
1701	1704	1705	1705	I	75	“ Gideon , ”
1841	1858	1832	1832	His	1324	“ I wanted to spend the weekend with you down in the Florida Keys — naked . ”
1859	1865	1832	1832	His	1324	“ Umm , sounds nice . ”
1910	1924	1925	1925	he	1324	“ Now I ’ve got to spend the weekend taking care of business , ”
1934	1944	1945	1945	He	1324	“ Business you put off to be with me ? ”
2002	2017	2028	2028	his	1324	“ I pay other people a generous salary so I can be with you . ”
2035	2051	2031	2031	I	75	“ Thank you . Let ’s get some coffee before we run out of time . ”
2065	2090	2052	2052	Gideon	1324	“ I ’d like to get off the ground by eight tomorrow night . Pack cool and light . Arizona ’s got dry heat . ”
2091	2094	2095	2095	I	75	“ What ? ”
2108	2116	2095	2095	I	75	“ Arizona is where your business is ? ”
2117	2120	2052	2052	Gideon	1324	“ Unfortunately . ”
2279	2287	2288	2288	I	75	“ It might be fortunate after all . ”
2299	2310	2288	2288	I	75	“ I need to knock heads with Cary this weekend . ”
2340	2349	2311	2311	Gideon	1324	“ You ’re coming with me , Eva . ”
2366	2385	2355	2355	I	75	“ To do what ? Lie around naked , waiting for you to finish work and fuck me ? ”
2406	2413	2391	2391	he	1324	“ Are we going to argue ? ”
2414	2440	2444	2444	I	75	“ Are you going to be difficult ? We talked about this . You know I ca n’t leave Cary after what happened last night . ”
2528	2561	2518	2518	me	75	“ You ’re going to take care of business and I ’m going to take care of my best friend , then we ’ll go back to taking care of each other . ”
2562	2574	2577	2577	I	75	“ I wo n’t be back until Sunday night , Eva . ”
2658	2668	2669	2669	he	1324	“ You ca n’t stand the thought , either , ”
2684	2693	2669	2669	he	1324	“ By Sunday we ’ll both be worthless . ”
2771	2783	2766	2766	I	75	“ We both know that ’s not exactly healthy , Gideon . ”
2784	2800	2803	2803	I	75	“ Says who ? No one else knows what it ’s like to be us . ”
2809	2817	2818	2818	I	75	“ We need to get to work , ”
2867	2879	2858	2858	he	1324	“ What we need is for you to come with me . ”
2880	2883	2884	2884	My	75	“ Gideon . ”
2894	2954	2884	2884	My	75	“ I ca n’t just give up my life for you . If I turn into arm candy , you ’ll get bored real quick . Hell , I ’d get sick of myself . It should n’t kill us to spend a couple days straightening out other parts of our lives , even if we hate doing it . ”
2960	2971	2955	2955	His	1324	“ You ’re too much trouble to be arm candy . ”
2972	2980	2884	2884	My	75	“ Takes a troublemaker to know one . ”
3004	3066	3002	3002	me	75	“ You ’ve gotten a lot of press lately , Eva . It ’s no secret that you ’re in New York . I ca n’t leave you here while I ’m gone . Bring Cary with us if you have to . You can butt heads with him while you ’re waiting for me to finish work and fuck you . ”
3067	3070	3073	3073	I	75	“ Ha . ”
3229	3236	3223	3223	Gideon	1324	“ Time to go , angel . ”
3300	3305	3306	3306	I	75	“ Hi , Angus , ”
3324	3331	3332	3332	he	254	“ Good morning , Miss Tramell , ”
3557	3579	3548	3548	Gideon	1324	“ Would you feel better if Cary and I left town for the weekend ? Maybe a quick trip to Vegas ? ”
3585	3602	3580	3580	Gideon	1324	“ Am I a threat to Cary ? Is that why you wo n’t consider Arizona ? ”
3603	3614	3622	3622	him	1324	“ What ? No . I do n’t think so . ”
3624	3641	3622	3622	him	1324	“ Sometimes it takes an all - nighter before I can get him to open up . ”
3642	3649	3650	3650	he	1324	“ You do n’t think so ? ”
3666	3690	3691	3691	I	75	“ He might feel like he ca n’t reach out to me when he needs to talk because I ’m always with you , ”
3707	3764	3691	3691	I	75	“ Listen , you ’re going to have to get over any jealousy about Cary . When I say he ’s like a brother to me , Gideon , I ’m not kidding . You do n’t have to like him , but you have to understand that he ’s a permanent part of my life . ”
3765	3776	3862	3862	His	1324	“ Do you tell him the same thing about me ? ”
3777	3796	3691	3691	I	75	“ I do n’t have to . He knows . I ’m trying to reach a compromise here — ”
3797	3802	3862	3862	His	1324	“ I never compromise . ”
3807	3831	3803	3803	My	75	“ In business , I ’m sure you do n’t . But this is a relationship , Gideon . It requires give and — ”
3839	3861	3832	3832	Gideon	1324	“ My plane , my hotel , and if you leave the premises , you take a security team with you . ”
3898	3909	3910	3910	I	75	“ Do n’t you think that ’s a little extreme ? ”
3913	3921	3910	3910	I	75	“ I ’ll have Cary with me . ”
3922	3940	3947	3947	his	1324	“ You ’ll forgive me if I do n’t trust him with your safety after last night . ”
4050	4053	4054	4054	I	75	“ Okay , ”
4057	4063	4054	4054	I	75	“ Which hotel is yours ? ”
4064	4076	4077	4077	He	60	“ I have a few . You can take your pick . ”
4087	4121	4077	4077	He	60	“ Scott will e - mail you the list . When you ’ve decided , let him know and he ’ll make the arrangements . We ’ll fly out together and return together . ”
4168	4172	4173	4173	I	75	“ Thank you , ”
4176	4189	4193	4193	his	1324	“ Do n’t . I ’m not happy about this , Eva . ”
4197	4212	4193	4193	his	1324	“ Your roommate fucks up and I have to spend the weekend without you . ”
4254	4271	4246	4246	I	75	“ I appreciate you bending on this , Gideon . It means a lot to me . ”
4281	4297	4272	4272	He	1324	“ I knew you were going to drive me insane the moment I saw you . ”
4307	4321	4298	4298	I	75	“ Sprawled on my ass on the lobby floor of the Crossfire Building ? ”
4322	4327	4298	4298	I	75	“ Before . Outside . ”
4333	4337	4330	4330	I	75	“ Outside where ? ”
4338	4343	4344	4344	Gideon	1324	“ On the sidewalk . ”
4365	4397	4344	4344	Gideon	1324	“ I was leaving for a meeting . A minute later and I would ’ve missed you . I ’d just gotten into the car when you came around the corner . ”
4437	4447	4448	4448	he	1324	“ You hit me the instant I saw you , ”
4452	4469	4448	4448	he	1324	“ I could n’t look away . I wanted you immediately . Excessively . Almost violently . ”
4521	4530	4531	4531	he	1324	“ You stopped right next to the Bentley , ”
4535	4565	4531	4531	he	1324	“ and your head tilted back . You were looking up at the building and I pictured you on your knees , looking up at me that same way . ”
4580	4584	4585	4585	I	75	“ What way ? ”
4596	4608	4613	4613	he	1324	“ With excitement . A little awe … a little intimidation . ”
4620	4678	4613	4613	he	1324	“ There was no way to stop myself from following you inside . And there you were , right where I ’d wanted you , damn near kneeling in front of me . In that minute , I had a half dozen fantasies about what I was going to do to you when I got you naked . ”
4689	4710	4679	4679	I	75	“ Looking at you for the first time made me think about sex . Screaming , sheet - clawing sex . ”
4711	4716	4717	4717	His	1324	“ I saw that . ”
4727	4754	4717	4717	His	1324	“ And I knew you saw me , too . Saw what I am … what I have inside me . You saw right through me . ”
4845	4861	4828	4828	Gideon	1324	“ No one ’s ever seen before , Eva . You ’re the only one . ”
4925	4947	4917	4917	they	272	“ I had no idea . You were so … cool . I did n’t seem to affect you at all . ”
4948	4951	4952	4952	he	1324	“ Cool ? ”
4955	4971	4952	4952	he	1324	“ I was on fire for you . I ’ve been fucked up ever since . ”
4972	4977	4917	4917	they	272	“ Gee . Thanks . ”
4978	4985	4986	4986	he	1324	“ You made me need you , ”
4989	5003	4986	4986	he	1324	“ Now I ca n’t stand the thought of two days without you . ”
5022	5029	5030	5030	I	75	“ I love you , too , ”
5037	5049	5030	5030	I	75	“ I ca n’t stand being away from you , either . ”
5090	5098	5099	5099	I	75	“ I ’m not even your type , ”
5168	5174	5175	5175	Gideon	1324	“ About the type thing — ”
5192	5207	5186	5186	He	1324	“ Corinne was surprised by you . You were n’t what she ’d expected . ”
5257	5263	5253	5253	my	75	“ Because I ’m blond ? ”
5264	5274	5253	5253	my	75	“ Because … you do n’t look like her . ”
5400	5403	5404	5404	He	1324	“ Eva . ”
5415	5425	5404	5404	He	1324	“ I do n’t know if she ’s right . ”
5473	5478	5468	5468	I	75	“ You do n’t ? ”
5479	5516	5465	5465	his	1324	“ If that ’s what it was , it was n’t conscious . I was n’t looking for her in other women . I did n’t know I was looking for anything until I saw you . ”
5584	5597	5598	5598	I	75	“ Maybe it was n’t a preference so much as a pattern . ”
5607	5666	5598	5598	I	75	“ You should ask Dr. Petersen when we see him tonight . I wish I had more answers after all my years of therapy , but I do n’t . There ’s a lot that ’s inexplicable between us , is n’t there ? I still have no idea what you see in me that ’s hooked you . ”
5667	5678	5679	5679	he	1324	“ It ’s what you see in me , angel , ”
5687	5737	5679	5679	he	1324	“ That you can know what I have in me and still want me as much as I want you . I go to sleep every night afraid I ’ll wake up and you ’ll be gone . Or that I scared you away … that I dreamed you — ”
5738	5743	5744	5744	Jesus	1648	“ No . Gideon . ”
5756	5786	5679	5679	he	1324	“ I know I do n’t tell you how I feel about you in the same way you tell me , but you have me . You know that . ”
5787	5798	5839	5839	his	1324	“ Yes , I know you love me , Gideon . ”
5812	5822	5829	5829	Gideon	1324	“ I ’m caught up with you , Eva . ”
5847	5854	5855	5855	he	1324	“ I ’d kill for you , ”
5858	5897	5855	5855	he	1324	“ give up everything I own for you … but I wo n’t give you up . Two days is my limit . Do n’t ask for more than that ; I ca n’t give it to you . ”
5967	5986	5963	5963	I	75	“ I just need the two days , ace , and I ’ll make them worth your while . ”
6000	6012	5990	5990	his	1324	“ Oh ? Planning on pacifying me with sex , angel ? ”
6013	6016	6017	6017	I	75	“ Yes , ”
6021	6038	6017	6017	I	75	“ Lots of it . After all , the tactic seems to work well for you . ”
6082	6087	6088	6088	he	1324	“ Ah , Eva , ”
6168	6175	6162	6162	Gideon	1324	“ Think about me all day . ”
6186	6190	6176	6176	I	75	“ Always do . ”
6374	6377	6378	6378	I	75	“ Hey , ”
6386	6393	6378	6378	I	75	“ Got any plans for lunch ? ”
6394	6399	6378	6378	I	75	“ I do now . ”
6400	6403	6404	6404	My	75	“ Awesome . ”
6562	6566	6567	6567	I	75	“ Cary Taylor , ”
6570	6583	6567	6567	I	75	“ I love you … even when you ’re pissing me off . ”
6667	6672	6673	6673	I	75	“ Maybe a little , ”
7091	7101	7102	7102	I	75	“ I thought you had the hang of it , ”
7116	7124	7125	7125	Mark	73	“ I do , thanks to you . ”
7213	7217	7218	7218	he	73	“ Try this , ”
7284	7289	7262	7262	I	75	“ What is this ? ”
7290	7296	7262	7262	I	75	“ Blueberry - flavored coffee . ”
7305	7314	7299	7299	I	75	“ Who the hell wants to drink that ? ”
7315	7335	7336	7336	He	73	“ Ah , see … it ’s our job to figure out who , then sell this to them . ”
7344	7352	7336	7336	He	73	“ Here ’s to our latest account ! ”
7448	7454	7455	7455	I	75	“ Mark Garrity ’s office , ”
7458	7463	7455	7455	I	75	“ Eva Tramell speaking . ”
7464	7471	7472	7472	Cary	1952	“ Are you serious about Vegas ? ”
7477	7480	7455	7455	I	75	“ Totally . ”
7486	7508	7455	7455	I	75	“ Is this when you tell me you ’re moving in with your billionaire boyfriend and I ’ve got to go ? ”
7509	7518	7519	7519	I	75	“ What ? No . Are you nuts ? ”
7546	7559	7519	7519	I	75	“ You ’re stuck with me for life , you know that . ”
7560	7573	7455	7455	I	75	“ And you just up and decided we should go to Vegas ? ”
7574	7596	7519	7519	I	75	“ Pretty much . Figured we could sip mojitos by the pool and live off room service for a couple days . ”
7597	7611	7455	7455	I	75	“ I ’m not sure how much I can pitch in for that . ”
7612	7637	7519	7519	I	75	“ Do n’t worry , it ’s on Gideon . His plane , his hotel . We ’ll just cover our food and drinks . ”
7660	7669	7455	7455	I	75	“ And he ’s not coming with us ? ”
7705	7740	7670	7670	I	75	“ He ’s got business in Arizona , so he ’ll share the flights back and forth , but it ’ll be just you and me in Vegas . I think we need it . ”
7741	7744	7745	7745	He	1952	“ Yeah . ”
7749	7767	7745	7745	He	1952	“ I could do with a change of scenery and some quality time with my best girl . ”
7768	7783	7670	7670	I	75	“ Okay , then . He wants to fly out by eight tomorrow night . ”
7784	7802	7745	7745	He	1952	“ I ’ll start packing . Want me to put a bag together for you , too ? ”
7803	7812	7813	7813	Cary	1952	“ Would you ? That ’d be great ! ”
7833	7836	7745	7745	He	1952	“ Eva ? ”
7837	7840	7745	7745	He	1952	“ Yeah ? ”
7844	7854	7841	7841	He	1952	“ Thank you for putting up with my shit . ”
7855	7859	7745	7745	He	1952	“ Shut up . ”
7972	7979	7969	7969	I	75	“ Dr. Terrence Lucas and wife , ”
8267	8271	8253	8253	I	75	“ Gideon Cross . ”
8305	8308	8309	8309	I	75	“ God . ”
8539	8542	8548	8548	me	75	“ Eva ? ”
8550	8561	8548	8548	me	75	“ It ’s Magdalene . Do you have a minute ? ”
8612	8619	8600	8600	Magdalene	67	“ Just . What ’s up ? ”
8634	8663	8620	8620	She	67	“ I was sitting at the table behind Corinne last night . I could hear a bit of what was being said between her and Gideon during dinner . ”
8685	8699	8700	8700	I	75	“ Stirring up crap while I ’m at work is a new low , ”
8704	8709	8700	8700	I	75	“ I do n’t — ”
8710	8717	8726	8726	she	67	“ He was n’t ignoring you . ”
8732	8783	8726	8726	she	67	“ He was managing her , Eva . She was making suggestions for where to take you around New York since you ’re new in town , but she was doing it by playing the old remember - when - you - and - I - went - there game . ”
8784	8791	8792	8792	I	75	“ A walk down memory lane , ”
8817	8820	8821	8821	Magdalene	67	“ Yes . ”
8827	8863	8821	8821	Magdalene	67	“ You left because you thought he was ignoring you for her . I just want you to know that he seemed to be thinking about you , trying to keep Corinne from upsetting you . ”
8864	8870	8899	8899	she	67	“ Why do you care ? ”
8871	8891	8821	8821	Magdalene	67	“ Who says I do ? I owe you one , Eva , for the way I introduced myself . ”
8944	8951	8937	8937	she	67	“ All right . Thank you . ”
8972	8976	8977	8977	Magdalene	67	“ Something else , ”
8981	8987	8977	8977	Magdalene	67	“ He went after you . ”
9034	9085	9095	9096	my man	345	“ There have been other women in his life who ’ve tried ultimatums like that , Eva . They got bored or they wanted his attention or some kind of grand gesture … So they walked away and expected him to come after them . You know what he did ? ”
9086	9089	9090	9090	I	75	“ Nothing , ”
9146	9158	9159	9159	she	795	“ Nothing more than making sure Angus dropped them off safely , ”
9177	9209	9159	9159	she	795	“ But when you left , he could n’t chase after you fast enough . And he was n’t himself when he said good - bye . He seemed … off . ”
9335	9342	9343	9343	I	75	“ Do I owe you now ? ”
9363	9406	9357	9357	Magdalene	67	“ Gideon and I have known each other a long time . Our mothers are best friends . You and I will see each other around , Eva , and I ’m hoping we can find a way to avoid any awkwardness . ”
9421	9425	9420	9420	Gideon	1324	“ shoved his dick ”
9431	9434	9436	9436	she	349	“ done . ”
9451	9468	9471	9471	she	349	“ Listen , Magdalene , if you do n’t cause drama , we ’ll get by . ”
9477	9500	9471	9471	she	349	“ I can screw up my relationship with Gideon all by myself , trust me . I do n’t need any help . ”
9505	9546	9501	9501	She	349	“ That was my mistake , I think — I was too careful and too accommodating . He has to work at it with you . Anyway … I ’ve taken up my minute . I ’ll let you go . ”
9547	9552	9553	9553	I	75	“ Enjoy your weekend , ”
9569	9574	9501	9501	She	349	“ You , too . ”
9766	9774	9775	9775	she	70	“ You hungry for anything in particular ? ”
9808	9819	9796	9796	I	75	“ No . Your choice . I ’m not picky . ”
9832	9841	9842	9842	Megumi	70	“ I am so ready for the weekend , ”
9860	9870	9848	9848	she	70	“ A day and a half left to go . ”
9871	9877	9848	9848	she	70	“ Got something fun planned ? ”
9878	9885	9886	9886	She	70	“ That remains to be seen . ”
9896	9900	9901	9901	she	70	“ Blind date , ”
9905	9917	9848	9848	she	70	“ Ah . Do you trust the person setting you up ? ”
9918	9947	9886	9886	She	70	“ My roommate . I expect the guy will at least be physically attractive , because I know where she sleeps at night and paybacks are a bitch . ”
9963	9975	9948	9948	I	75	“ Well , that ups your odds for a good time . ”
9976	10007	9848	9848	she	70	“ Not really , since she found him by going on a blind date with him first . She swears he ’s great , just more my type than hers . ”
10008	10011	9948	9948	I	75	“ Hmm . ”
10012	10018	10019	10019	Megumi	70	“ I know , right ? ”
10044	10056	9948	9948	I	75	“ You ’ll have to let me know how it goes . ”
10057	10066	10021	10021	her	70	“ Oh , yeah . Wish me luck . ”
10067	10070	10071	10071	We	354	“ Absolutely . ”
10123	10127	10128	10128	I	75	“ Excuse me , ”
10141	10146	10135	10135	She	70	“ Go for it . ”
10147	10150	10151	10151	I	75	“ Hey , ”
10156	10159	10135	10135	She	70	“ Eva . ”
10337	10340	10334	10334	I	75	“ Gideon … ”
10341	10361	10320	10320	him	1324	“ You wanted my attention — now you have it . I want to hear you say those words . ”
10368	10382	10362	10362	I	75	“ I ca n’t . Not here . Let me call you later . ”
10383	10395	10320	10320	him	1324	“ Step over by the column and out of the way . ”
10450	10461	10462	10462	I	75	“ Hurry along , angel . Your friend ’s waiting . ”
10474	10496	10462	10462	I	75	“ Now tell me . Your text made me hard , Eva . What are you going to do about it ? ”
10538	10546	10518	10518	I	75	“ I want you in my mouth . ”
10547	10564	10570	10570	his	75	“ Why ? To play with me ? To tease me like you ’re doing now ? ”
10590	10593	10594	10594	I	75	“ No . ”
10612	10626	10594	10594	I	75	“ To make you come . I love making you come , Gideon . ”
10631	10637	10627	10627	He	75	“ A gift , then . ”
10683	10686	10721	10721	I	75	“ Always . ”
10687	10720	10721	10721	I	75	“ Good . Because I treasure you , Eva , and what we have . Even our driving urge to fuck each other constantly is precious to me , because it matters . ”
10778	10781	10782	10782	I	75	“ Yes , ”
10789	10793	10782	10782	I	75	“ It matters . ”
10909	10921	10922	10922	His	1324	“ You can have what you want after work , angel . ”
10929	10951	10922	10922	His	1324	“ In the meantime , enjoy lunch with your coworker . I ’ll be thinking about you . And your mouth . ”
10952	10959	10922	10922	His	1324	“ I love you , Gideon . ”
10980	10987	10977	10977	Megumi	70	“ I ’m sorry about that . ”
10988	10993	10922	10922	His	1324	“ Everything all right ? ”
10994	11001	10977	10977	Megumi	70	“ Yes . Everything ’s fine . ”
11002	11014	11015	11015	She	70	“ Things still hot and heavy with you and Gideon Cross ? ”
11024	11027	11015	11015	She	70	“ Umm … ”
11031	11040	11015	11015	She	70	“ Yes , that ’s fine , too . ”
11137	11142	11143	11143	Megumi	70	“ He sure is , ”
11146	11160	11143	11143	Megumi	70	“ Damn fine . Did you know him before you started working here ? ”
11161	11173	11176	11176	our	368	“ No . Although I suppose we would have met eventually . ”
11270	11274	11275	11275	Megumi	70	“ I wondered . ”
11283	11294	11295	11295	she	70	“ I read that it was serious between you two , ”
11307	11318	11295	11295	she	70	“ So I thought maybe you ’d known him before . ”
11319	11331	11295	11295	she	70	“ Do n’t believe everything you read on those gossip blogs . ”
11332	11339	11295	11295	she	70	“ So it ’s not serious ? ”
11340	11347	11295	11295	she	70	“ I did n’t say that . ”
11365	11423	11360	11360	She	70	“ God … listen to me pry . Sorry . Gossip is one of my vices . So are extremely hot men like Gideon Cross . I ca n’t help but wonder what it ’d be like to hook up with a guy whose body screams sex like that . Tell me he ’s awesome in bed . ”
11456	11464	11451	11453	nothing beat girl	376	“ You wo n’t hear me complaining . ”
11465	11469	11476	11476	she	70	“ Lucky bitch . ”
11483	11512	11480	11480	she	70	“ How about that roommate of yours ? From the photos I saw , he ’s gorgeous , too . Is he single ? Wanna hook me up ? ”
11577	11600	11573	11573	Cary	1952	“ I do n’t know if he ’s single or not . Things are … complicated in his life at the moment . ”
11601	11624	11666	11666	guy	379	“ Well , if the opportunity presents itself , I ’m certainly not opposed . Just sayin ’ . You like tacos ? ”
11625	11629	11573	11573	Cary	1952	“ Love ’em . ”
11630	11644	11666	11666	guy	379	“ I know a great place a couple blocks up . Come on . ”
12197	12200	12201	12201	Megumi	70	“ Hey . ”
12209	12219	12201	12201	Megumi	70	“ And we only had virgin margaritas , lightweight ! ”
12284	12297	12298	12298	I	75	“ I ’ll be back in five minutes , if anyone asks , ”
12312	12323	12324	12324	she	70	“ Give him a kiss for me , will you ? ”
12331	12343	12324	12324	she	70	“ Makes me hot just thinking about living vicariously through you . ”
12516	12521	12522	12522	he	63	“ Hello , Eva , ”
12531	12541	12522	12522	he	63	“ I ’ll let him know you ’re here . ”
12582	12587	12579	12579	my	75	“ Is he alone ? ”
12588	12593	12522	12522	he	63	“ Yes , but — ”
12868	12878	12879	12879	he	1324	“ It ’s not a good time , Eva , ”
12913	12922	12923	12923	I	75	“ I ’m running late to an appointment . ”
12988	12995	13011	13011	his	1324	“ Why are you half dressed ? ”
13090	13098	13099	13099	He	1324	“ I got something on my shirt . ”
13126	13168	13111	13111	he	1324	“ I have to run . If you need something , let Scott know and he ’ll see to it . Or I ’ll take care of it when I get back . I should n’t be more than two hours . ”
13169	13176	13177	13177	He	1324	“ Why are you running late ? ”
13187	13199	13177	13177	He	1324	“ I had to squeeze in a last - minute meeting . ”
13204	13210	13201	13201	you	411	“ You showered this morning . ”
13220	13229	13201	13201	you	411	“ Why did you have to shower again ? ”
13230	13235	13236	13236	he	1324	“ Why the inquisition ? ”
13335	13338	13339	13339	he	1324	“ Eva ! ”
13347	13357	13339	13339	he	1324	“ What the hell is the matter with you ? ”
13358	13364	13339	13339	he	1324	“ Fuck you , asswipe . ”
13365	13369	13339	13339	he	1324	“ Excuse me ? ”
13408	13412	13413	13413	he	1324	“ Goddamn it , ”
13425	13432	13413	13413	he	1324	“ Do n’t fucking hit me ! ”
13433	13439	13443	13443	his	1324	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
13465	13474	13457	13457	He	1324	“ What the fuck ’s gotten into you ? ”
13475	13482	13443	13443	his	1324	“ I saw her , Gideon . ”
13483	13487	13457	13457	He	1324	“ Saw who ? ”
13488	13491	13443	13443	his	1324	“ Corinne ! ”
13495	13502	13492	13492	He	1324	“ What are you talking about ? ”
13516	13519	13508	13508	I	75	“ Busted . ”
13534	13541	13542	13542	he	1324	“ Busted doing what , exactly ? ”
13548	13554	13555	13555	I	75	“ Oh , screw you . ”
13568	13578	13555	13555	I	75	“ I ’m not spelling it out for you . ”
13606	13618	13597	13597	he	1324	“ Yes . Yes , you goddamn will spell it out . ”
13688	13698	13699	13699	I	75	“ Does n’t a picture say a thousand words ? ”
13706	13721	13699	13699	I	75	“ So Corinne was manhandled . What does that have to do with me ? ”
13722	13732	13699	13699	I	75	“ Are you kidding me ? Let me out . ”
13733	13779	13699	13699	I	75	“ I do n’t find anything even remotely funny about this . In fact , I do n’t think I ’ve ever been this pissed off at a woman . You come in here with your half - assed accusations and self - righteous bullshit — ”
13780	13785	13786	13786	I	75	“ I am righteous ! ”
13812	13836	13786	13786	I	75	“ I would never cheat on you ! If I wanted to fuck around , I ’d break it off with you first . ”
13871	13879	13880	13880	His	1324	“ You think I cheated on you ? ”
13909	13939	13887	13887	I	75	“ Explain to me why she was here at the Crossfire , looking like she did . Why your office looks like this . Why you look like that . ”
13960	13991	13940	13940	His	1324	“ I do n’t know why Corinne was here or why she looked like that . I have n’t seen her since last night , when you were with me . ”
14012	14020	14021	14021	I	75	“ But I was n’t with you , ”
14025	14047	14021	14021	I	75	“ She batted her eyelashes and said she wanted to introduce you to someone , and you left me standing there . ”
14048	14051	14052	14052	His	1324	“ Christ . ”
14056	14061	14052	14052	His	1324	“ Not this again . ”
14077	14101	14074	14074	He	1324	“ You think I went with her because I was overcome with the need to be with her and get away from you ? ”
14102	14122	14074	14074	He	1324	“ I do n’t know , Gideon . You ditched me . You ’re the one with the answers . ”
14123	14129	14074	14074	He	1324	“ You ditched me first . ”
14135	14140	14130	14130	My	75	“ I did not ! ”
14141	14176	14074	14074	He	1324	“ The hell you did n’t . Almost the second we arrived , you took off . I had to hunt you down and when I did , you were dancing with that prick . ”
14177	14184	14187	14188	Richard Stanton	315	“ Martin is Stanton ’s nephew ! ”
14200	14218	14074	14074	He	1324	“ I do n’t care if he ’s a damned priest . He wants to nail you . ”
14219	14252	14190	14191	my stepdad	315	“ Oh my God . That ’s absurd ! Stop deflecting . You were talking business with your associates . It was awkward standing there . For them as well as me . ”
14253	14263	14074	14074	He	1324	“ That ’s your place , awkward or not ! ”
14275	14279	14264	14264	My	75	“ Come again ? ”
14280	14320	14190	14191	my stepdad	315	“ How would you feel if I walked away from you at a Waters Field and Leaman party because you started talking about a campaign ? Then , when you found me , I was slow dancing with Magdalene ? ”
14321	14324	14325	14325	God	1648	“ I — ”
14377	14425	14362	14362	He	1324	“ It ’s my place to stand beside you , and support you , and yes , just fucking look pretty on your arm sometimes . It ’s my right , my duty , and my privilege , Eva , just as it ’s yours in reverse . ”
14426	14442	14362	14362	He	1324	“ I thought I was doing you a favor by getting out of the way . ”
14461	14476	14453	14453	My	75	“ Is that why you walked off with Corinne ? Were you punishing me ? ”
14477	14495	14362	14362	He	1324	“ If I wanted to punish you , Eva , I ’d take you over my knee . ”
14507	14514	14515	14515	he	1324	“ I know how you get , ”
14519	14577	14515	14515	he	1324	“ I did n’t want you jealous over Corinne before I had a chance to explain . I needed a few minutes to make sure she understood how serious you and I are , and how important it was to me that you enjoy the evening . That ’s the only reason I walked away with her . ”
14578	14614	14649	14649	her	795	“ You told her not to say anything about you two , did n’t you ? You told her to keep quiet about what she is to you . Too bad Magdalene screwed that up . ”
14731	14741	14742	14742	he	1324	“ I wanted you to hear it from me , ”
14759	14777	14746	14746	I	75	“ I saw Corinne get into the Bentley , Gideon . Right before I came up here . ”
14787	14791	14778	14778	His	1324	“ Did you ? ”
14792	14803	14778	14778	His	1324	“ Yes , I did . Can you explain that ? ”
14804	14811	14778	14778	His	1324	“ I ca n’t , no . ”
14829	14845	14818	14818	I	75	“ Then get out of my way , I have to get back to work . ”
14851	14871	14846	14846	He	1324	“ I just want to be clear on something before you go : Do you believe I fucked her ? ”
14881	14894	14873	14873	him	1324	“ I do n’t know what to believe . The evidence sure — ”
14895	14917	14918	14918	He	1324	“ I would n’t care if the ‘ evidence ’ included you finding me and her naked in a bed together . ”
14933	14957	14929	14929	He	1324	“ I want to know if you think I fucked her . If you think I would . Or could . Do you ? ”
14970	14980	14965	14965	I	75	“ Explain the lipstick on your shirt , Gideon . ”
14985	14988	14981	14981	His	1324	“ No . ”
14989	14992	14999	14999	me	75	“ What ? ”
15004	15009	14981	14981	His	1324	“ Answer my question . ”
15088	15095	15096	15096	I	75	“ I need you to explain , ”
15128	15139	15096	15096	I	75	“ I ’ve given you no reason to doubt me . ”
15140	15150	15151	15151	I	75	“ You ’re giving me one now , Gideon . ”
15175	15251	15170	15170	he	1324	“ I understand you need time before you share secrets that are painful for you . I ’ve been where you ’re at , knowing I needed to talk about what happened to me but just not ready . That ’s why I ’ve tried very hard not to push you or rush you . But this secret is one that ’s hurting me , and that ’s different . Do n’t you see that ? ”
15265	15338	15257	15257	he	1324	“ I go out of my way to make sure you do n’t have any reason to feel jealous , but when you do get possessive , I like it . I want you to fight for me . I want you to care that much . I want you crazy about me . But possessiveness without trust is hell . If you do n’t trust me , we ’ve got nothing . ”
15339	15347	15170	15170	he	1324	“ Trust goes both ways , Gideon . ”
15355	15367	15348	15348	He	1324	“ Damn it . Do n’t look at me like that . ”
15368	15438	15439	15439	I	75	“ I ’m trying to figure out who you are . Where ’s the man who came right out and said he wanted to fuck me ? The man who did n’t hesitate to tell me I tie him up in knots , even as I was breaking up with him ? I believed you ’d always be brutally honest like that . I counted on it . Now — ”
15482	15505	15474	15474	I	75	“ I wo n’t run this time , but you can push me away . You might want to think about that . ”
15676	15683	15684	15684	he	1324	“ We should leave at five , ”
15687	15697	15684	15684	he	1324	“ to get to Dr. Petersen ’s on time . ”
15698	15701	15702	15702	I	75	“ Oh . ”
15734	15741	15742	15742	he	1324	“ I ’ll come get you , ”
15747	15753	15742	15742	he	1324	“ when it ’s time . ”
15775	15796	15764	15764	I	75	“ I ’m sorry I hit you . I should n’t have done that . I hate that I did . ”
15797	15800	15801	15801	Gideon	1324	“ Angel . ”
15805	15816	15801	15801	Gideon	1324	“ You did n’t ask the one question that matters . ”
15830	15846	15825	15825	he	1324	“ Either way , it does n’t change the fact that you ’re keeping secrets . ”
15847	15860	15801	15801	Gideon	1324	“ Secrets are something we can work through ; cheating is n’t . ”
15870	15877	15861	15861	I	75	“ You ’re right about that . ”
15878	15886	15887	15887	His	1324	“ There ’s only you , Eva . ”
15926	15934	15919	15919	I	75	“ I ’ll be ready at five . ”
16074	16077	16064	16064	he	1324	“ Ready ? ”
16131	16140	16141	16141	I	75	“ She ’s crushing on you , Cross , ”
16160	16163	16164	16164	He	1324	“ Whatever . ”
16167	16175	16164	16164	He	1324	“ What does she know about me ? ”
16176	16188	16189	16189	I	75	“ I ’ve been asking myself that same question all day , ”
16370	16383	16362	16363	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Shall we start with the cause of the tension between you ? ”
16411	16433	16398	16398	I	75	“ Well … in the last twenty - four hours I ’ve met the fiancée I did n’t know Gideon had — ”
16434	16439	16440	16440	Gideon	1324	“ Ex - fiancée , ”
16443	16460	16398	16398	I	75	“ — I found out the reason he ’s dated brunettes exclusively is because of her — ”
16461	16467	16398	16398	I	75	“ It was n’t dating . ”
16468	16483	16484	16484	I	75	“ — and I caught her leaving his office after lunch looking like this — ”
16490	16497	16498	16498	Gideon	1324	“ She was leaving the building , ”
16502	16507	16498	16498	Gideon	1324	“ not my office . ”
16522	16531	16508	16508	I	75	“ And getting into your car , Gideon ! ”
16532	16556	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Angus just told you before we got here that he saw her standing there , recognized her , and was being polite . ”
16557	16565	16566	16566	I	75	“ Like he ’d say anything different ! ”
16570	16590	16566	16566	I	75	“ He ’s been your driver since you were a kid . Of course he ’d cover your ass . ”
16591	16600	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Oh , it ’s a conspiracy now ? ”
16601	16610	16611	16611	I	75	“ What was he doing there , then ? ”
16614	16620	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Driving me to lunch . ”
16621	16647	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Where ? I ’ll just verify you were there and she was n’t , and we ’ll get that part out of the way . ”
16653	16672	16648	16648	Gideon	1324	“ I told you . I had an unexpected appointment . I did n’t make it to lunch . ”
16673	16679	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Who was the appointment ? ”
16680	16686	16648	16648	Gideon	1324	“ It was n’t Corinne . ”
16687	16694	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ That ’s not an answer ! ”
16710	16754	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ When I went up to his office to ask him what the hell was going on , I discovered him half dressed and freshly showered , with one of his sofas bumped out of place , pillows strewn all over the floor — ”
16755	16760	16699	16700	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ One goddamned pillow ! ”
16761	16770	16519	16520	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ — and red lipstick on his shirt . ”
16771	16781	16782	16782	Gideon	1324	“ There are two dozen businesses in the Crossfire , ”
16786	16797	16782	16782	Gideon	1324	“ She could have been visiting any one of them . ”
16798	16801	16802	16802	I	75	“ Right , ”
16810	16814	16802	16802	I	75	“ Of course . ”
16815	16826	16782	16782	Gideon	1324	“ Would n’t I have taken her to the hotel ? ”
16836	16843	16827	16827	I	75	“ You still have that room ? ”
16912	16918	16919	16920	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Let ’s slow down , ”
16926	16945	16919	16920	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ I want to backtrack a bit . Gideon , why did n’t you tell Eva about Corinne ? ”
16946	16955	16956	16956	Gideon	1324	“ I had every intention of doing so , ”
16960	16968	16969	16969	I	75	“ He does n’t tell me anything , ”
17013	17020	17021	17022	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ What do you talk about ? ”
17033	17039	17040	17040	Gideon	1324	“ I ’m usually apologizing , ”
17048	17052	17043	17044	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ For what ? ”
17053	17056	17057	17057	He	1648	“ Everything . ”
17065	17081	17043	17044	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Do you feel that Eva ’s too demanding or expects too much from you ? ”
17091	17101	17082	17082	I	75	“ No . She does n’t ask for anything . ”
17102	17107	17108	17108	I	75	“ Except the truth , ”
17124	17132	17115	17115	His	1324	“ I ’ve never lied to you . ”
17133	17146	17147	17148	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Do you want her to ask you for things , Gideon ? ”
17154	17166	17167	17168	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Think about that . We ’ll come back to it . ”
17175	17201	17167	17168	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ I ’m intrigued by the photo you took , Eva . You were confronted with a situation that many women would find deeply upsetting — ”
17202	17208	17209	17209	Gideon	1324	“ There was no situation , ”
17213	17220	17221	17222	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Her perception of a situation , ”
17225	17239	17221	17222	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ A patently ridiculous perception , considering the physical aspect of our relationship . ”
17240	17263	17271	17271	Gideon	1324	“ All right . Let ’s talk about that . How many times a week do you have sex ? On average . ”
17281	17284	17285	17285	My	75	“ Umm … ”
17290	17294	17285	17285	My	75	“ A lot . ”
17295	17298	17299	17300	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Daily ? ”
17314	17319	17299	17300	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Multiple times daily ? ”
17324	17328	17320	17320	Gideon	1324	“ On average . ”
17344	17355	17337	17338	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Is this level of sexual activity customary for you ? ”
17356	17368	17383	17383	Gideon	1324	“ Nothing about my relationship with Eva is customary , Doctor . ”
17369	17382	17337	17338	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ What was the frequency of your sexual encounters prior to Eva ? ”
17394	17399	17400	17400	I	75	“ It ’s okay , ”
17448	17453	17454	17454	he	1324	“ Twice a week , ”
17458	17462	17454	17454	he	1324	“ On average . ”
17487	17512	17482	17483	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Eva has brought up concerns of infidelity and lack of communication in your relationship . How often is sex used to resolve disagreements ? ”
17518	17573	17513	17513	Gideon	1324	“ Before you assume Eva ’s suffering under the demands of my overactive libido , you should know that she initiates sex at least as often as I do . If one of us were going to have concerns about keeping up , it ’d be me just by virtue of possessing male anatomy . ”
17582	17591	17592	17592	I	75	“ Most interactions between us lead to sex , ”
17595	17599	17592	17592	I	75	“ including fights . ”
17600	17614	17574	17575	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Before or after the conflict is considered resolved by both of you ? ”
17618	17621	17615	17615	I	75	“ Before . ”
17650	17661	17662	17662	he	1648	“ Your relationship has been highly sexualized from the beginning ? ”
17675	17684	17665	17665	I	75	“ We ’re very attracted to each other . ”
17685	17688	17689	17689	He	1648	“ Obviously . ”
17698	17713	17689	17689	He	1648	“ However , I ’d like to discuss the possibility of abstinence while we — ”
17714	17720	17721	17721	Gideon	1324	“ There is no possibility , ”
17724	17749	17721	17721	Gideon	1324	“ That ’s a nonstarter . I suggest we focus on what ’s not working without eliminating one of the few things that is . ”
17750	17761	17762	17763	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ I ’m not sure it is working , Gideon , ”
17767	17775	17762	17763	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Not the way it should be . ”
17776	17779	17780	17780	Gideon	1324	“ Doctor . ”
17799	17823	17780	17780	Gideon	1324	“ The only way I ’m keeping my hands off her is if I ’m dead . Find another way to fix us . ”
17824	17832	17833	17833	Gideon	1324	“ I’M new to this therapy thing , ”
17850	17868	17833	17833	Gideon	1324	“ So I ’m not sure . Was that the train wreck it felt like it was ? ”
17869	17876	17877	17877	I	75	“ It could ’ve gone better , ”
17909	17921	17877	17877	I	75	“ I ’d kill for a quick shower and my bed . ”
17922	17939	17877	17877	I	75	“ I have some things to take care of before I can call it a day . ”
17940	17945	17946	17946	I	75	“ That ’s fine . ”
17949	17964	17946	17946	I	75	“ Why do n’t we take the night off and see each other tomorrow ? ”
18014	18021	18006	18006	his	1324	“ You ’re cutting me off . ”
18022	18028	17999	17999	His	1324	“ No , I ’m — ”
18029	18051	18006	18006	his	1324	“ The hell you ’re not ! You ’ve tried and convicted me , and now you ’re shutting me out . ”
18052	18080	17999	17999	His	1324	“ I ’m exhausted , Gideon ! There ’s only so much bullshit I can take before I ’m buried in it . I need sleep and — ”
18081	18086	18087	18087	he	1324	“ I need you , ”
18090	18103	18087	18087	he	1324	“ What is it going to take to make you believe me ? ”
18104	18156	17999	17999	His	1324	“ I do n’t think you cheated . Okay ? As suspicious as it all looks , I ca n’t convince myself you ’d do that . It ’s the secrets that are getting to be too much . I ’m giving all I ’ve got to this and you ’re — ”
18157	18164	18165	18165	He	1324	“ You think I ’m not ? ”
18185	18203	18165	18165	He	1324	“ I ’ve never worked so hard for anything in my life as I have for you . ”
18204	18222	17999	17999	His	1324	“ You ca n’t make the effort for me . You have to do it for you . ”
18223	18245	18165	18165	He	1324	“ Do n’t give me that crap ! I would n’t need to work on my relationship skills for anyone else . ”
18264	18292	18251	18251	I	75	“ I ’m tired of fighting , Gideon . I just want some peace and quiet for a night . I ’ve been feeling off all day . ”
18293	18298	18299	18299	He	75	“ Are you sick ? ”
18317	18329	18299	18299	He	75	“ You do n’t feel hot . Is your stomach upset ? ”
18359	18362	18367	18367	me	75	“ No . ”
18372	18377	18378	18378	He	75	“ What is it ? ”
18389	18400	18378	18378	He	75	“ What ’s wrong ? Do you need a doctor ? ”
18401	18407	18408	18408	I	75	“ It ’s my period , ”
18417	18450	18408	18408	I	75	“ It should start any day now . I do n’t know why I did n’t realize it before . No wonder I ’m so tired and cranky ; I ’m hormonal . ”
18479	18502	18476	18476	he	75	“ That ’s a new one for me . Not something that comes up in the course of a casual sex life . ”
18503	18521	18476	18476	he	75	“ Lucky you . You get to experience the inconvenience reserved for men with girlfriends and wives . ”
18522	18527	18528	18528	Gideon	1324	“ I am lucky . ”
18550	18570	18528	18528	Gideon	1324	“ And maybe , if I ’m really lucky , you ’ll feel better tomorrow and like me again . ”
18582	18607	18573	18573	God	1648	“ I like you now , Gideon . I just do n’t like you keeping secrets . It ’s going to break us up . ”
18608	18614	18615	18615	he	75	“ Do n’t let it , ”
18625	18629	18615	18615	he	75	“ Trust me . ”
18630	18638	18643	18643	he	75	“ You have to trust me back . ”
18651	18659	18660	18660	he	75	“ Do n’t you know , angel ? ”
18663	18672	18660	18660	he	75	“ There ’s no one I trust more . ”
18864	18867	18873	18873	our	441	“ Gideon … ”
18887	18890	18891	18891	he	75	“ Shh , ”
18894	18903	18891	18891	he	75	“ I ’m here . Not going anywhere . ”
19149	19152	19153	19153	he	60	“ Yeah , ”
19156	19174	19153	19153	he	60	“ … like it once it ’s in you … hot little slut … you like it … ”
19217	19223	19206	19206	I	75	“ Eva ! Wake up ! ”
19288	19301	19302	19302	I	75	“ Christ ! Eva , damn it . Do n’t hurt yourself ! ”
19329	19332	19318	19318	Gideon	1324	“ Eva . ”
19333	19336	19337	19337	I	75	“ Sick , ”
19351	19357	19358	19358	he	1324	“ I ’ve got you , ”
19405	19410	19411	19411	he	1324	“ Shh … angel , ”
19418	19427	19411	19411	he	1324	“ It ’s okay . You ’re safe . ”
19461	19465	19466	19466	I	75	“ Baby girl . ”
19571	19578	19558	19558	I	75	“ What are you guys doing ? ”
19579	19586	19587	19587	Cary	1952	“ I was just coming in , ”
19590	19601	19587	19587	Cary	1952	“ And caught up with Cross on his way up . ”
19615	19620	19602	19602	I	75	“ You went out ? ”
19628	19641	19621	19621	Gideon	1324	“ I told you I had some things to take care of . ”
19645	19649	19621	19621	Gideon	1324	“ What things ? ”
19650	19656	19621	19621	Gideon	1324	“ It ’s not important . ”
19700	19713	19682	19682	Cary	1952	“ You have n’t had a bad dream in a long time . ”
19739	19763	19731	19731	He	1952	“ We ’ll take it easy this weekend . Recharge . We both need it . You gon na be all right tonight ? ”
19764	19770	19771	19771	Gideon	1324	“ I ’ve got her . ”
19791	19801	19802	19802	Cary	1952	“ That does n’t mean I ’m not here . ”
19811	19818	19802	19802	Cary	1952	“ Holler if you need me . ”
19909	19915	19895	19895	I	75	“ I need a shower . ”
20028	20033	20009	20009	He	1324	“ How are you ? ”
20034	20037	20051	20051	he	1324	“ Better . ”
20057	20070	20051	20051	he	1324	“ I … Jesus , Eva . Were you dreaming about Nathan ? ”
20077	20090	20071	20071	I	75	“ Maybe one day we ’ll talk about our dreams , huh ? ”
20102	20111	20091	20091	He	1324	“ It ’s like that , is it ? ”
20112	20115	20116	20116	I	75	“ Yeah , ”
20119	20125	20116	20116	I	75	“ It ’s like that . ”
20188	20191	20192	20192	Gideon	1324	“ Angel … ”
20216	20244	20198	20198	his	1324	“ Do n’t cry … God . I ca n’t take it . Tell me what you need , angel . Tell me what I can do . ”
20245	20250	20251	20251	I	75	“ Wash it away , ”
20275	20280	20266	20266	My	75	“ Make me clean . ”
20281	20285	20286	20286	I	75	“ You are . ”
20297	20310	20311	20311	he	1324	“ Listen to me , Eva . No one can touch you , ”
20315	20326	20311	20311	he	1324	“ No one can get to you . Never again . ”
20333	20350	20311	20311	he	1324	“ They ’d have to get through me , Eva . And that will never happen . ”
20478	20482	20483	20483	he	453	“ Feel good ? ”
20492	20495	20483	20483	he	453	“ Always . ”
20545	20552	20539	20539	he	453	“ I ’m not nearly done . ”
20561	20564	20553	20553	I	75	“ Gideon . ”
20609	20616	20617	20617	I	75	“ I ’m going to fall , ”
20624	20638	20617	20617	I	75	“ I ’ll catch you , angel . I ’ll always catch you . ”
20717	20728	20729	20729	I	75	“ You can be so good for me , Gideon , ”
20734	20751	20729	20729	I	75	“ I do n’t know how I could ever forget that . Even for a minute . ”
20788	20814	20779	20779	His	1324	“ I know today was all kinds of fucked up . Shit … the whole week . It ’s been hard for me , too . ”
20815	20819	20820	20820	I	75	“ I know . ”
20871	20874	20875	20875	He	1324	“ Eva … ”
20880	20887	20875	20875	He	1324	“ Let me finish , angel . ”
20910	20919	20888	20888	I	75	“ Why do n’t you get started instead ? ”
20920	20929	20890	20890	his	1324	“ That is n’t where this was headed . ”
20984	20993	20975	20975	he	1324	“ Well … revisit and revise , ace . ”
21056	21059	21049	21049	He	1324	“ Eva … ”
21060	21070	21049	21049	He	1324	“ It would be a shame to waste this . ”
21071	21081	21082	21082	His	1324	“ I ca n’t screw this up with you . ”
21089	21107	21082	21082	His	1324	“ If you ever freaked out while I was touching you , I ’d lose my mind . ”
21108	21113	21049	21049	He	1324	“ Gideon , please — ”
21114	21119	21082	21082	His	1324	“ I say when . ”
21214	21220	21221	21221	he	1324	“ See something you like ? ”
21409	21414	21415	21415	I	75	“ Oh my God , ”
21420	21427	21415	21415	I	75	“ You are so fucking hot . ”
21462	21469	21444	21444	His	1324	“ Could you come watching me ? ”
21541	21548	21549	21549	His	1324	“ I love you , Gideon . ”
21584	21588	21567	21567	they	457	“ Show me . ”
21707	21722	21700	21700	I	75	“ There you go , angel . Show me what I do to you . ”
21760	21767	21768	21768	He	1324	“ Look at me , Eva . ”
21792	21808	21768	21768	He	1324	“ I do n’t want to come without you . I need you with me . ”
22011	22014	22015	22015	I	75	“ Gideon . ”
22034	22040	22041	22041	he	75	“ Right there with you , ”
22124	22127	22128	22128	he	1324	“ Eva ! ”
22144	22147	22128	22128	he	1324	“ Fuck . ”
22412	22418	22419	22419	he	1952	“ Morning , baby girl , ”
22433	22439	22419	22419	he	1952	“ You ’re up early . ”
22440	22446	22447	22447	He	1952	“ Look who ’s talking . ”
22476	22482	22468	22468	He	1952	“ How are you doing ? ”
22483	22490	22491	22491	I	75	“ I ’m good . Really , ”
22502	22509	22491	22491	I	75	“ Gideon took care of me . ”
22510	22536	22491	22491	I	75	“ Okay , but is that really so great if he ’s the reason you were stressed enough to have the nightmare to begin with ? ”
22612	22618	22607	22607	He	1952	“ No explanation , huh ? ”
22632	22642	22619	22619	I	75	“ How about you ? How are you doing ? ”
22643	22652	22619	22619	I	75	“ You just gon na change the subject ? ”
22653	22669	22619	22619	I	75	“ What else is there to say ? It ’s a one - sided story . ”
22670	22683	22619	22619	I	75	“ You ever stop to think that he might always have secrets ? ”
22691	22697	22686	22686	I	75	“ What do you mean ? ”
22698	22731	22732	22732	One	90	“ I mean he ’s the twenty - eight - year - old son of a suicidal Ponzi scheme swindler , and he just happens to own a large chunk of Manhattan . ”
22739	22752	22732	22732	One	90	“ Think about it . Can they really be mutually exclusive things ? ”
22795	22819	22782	22782	Gideon	1324	“ I ca n’t see Gideon bilking people , not when it ’s more of a challenge to accomplish what he has legitimately . ”
22820	22844	22782	22782	Gideon	1324	“ With all the secrets he ’s got , can you be sure you know him well enough to make that judgment call ? ”
22875	22878	22863	22863	I	75	“ Yes . ”
22879	22885	22886	22886	Cary	1952	“ All right , then . ”
22889	22897	22886	22886	Cary	1952	“ I talked to Dr. Travis yesterday . ”
22915	22919	22898	22898	My	75	“ You did ? ”
22920	22931	22886	22886	Cary	1952	“ Yeah . I really fucked up the other night . ”
22960	22971	22972	22972	he	1952	“ Cross broke Ian ’s nose and split his lip , ”
22995	23027	22987	22987	friend	478	“ I saw Ian yesterday and he looks like he was hit in the face with a brick . He was asking who clocked him , so he could press charges . ”
23028	23031	23032	23032	My	75	“ Oh . ”
23042	23047	23032	23032	My	75	“ Oh , crap . ”
23048	23066	23067	23067	Cary	1952	“ I know . Billionaire plus lawsuit equals beaucoup bucks . What the fuck was I thinking ? ”
23075	23111	23067	23067	Cary	1952	“ I told him I did n’t know who your date was , that it was some guy you picked up and dragged home . Cross blindsided him , so Ian did n’t see shit . ”
23112	23126	23127	23127	I	75	“ The two girls with you got a real good look at Gideon , ”
23131	23137	23145	23145	our	481	“ They took off out that door”—Cary
23152	23193	23145	23145	our	481	slam—“like she - bats out of hell . They did n’t go to the urgent care with us , and neither of us knows who they are . If Ian does n’t run into them again , we ’re okay . ”
23207	23217	23218	23218	he	75	“ I ’ll keep an eye on the situation , ”
23222	23256	23218	23218	he	75	“ The whole night was a major wake - up call , and talking it out in therapy gave me some perspective . Afterward , I went to see Trey . To apologize . ”
23289	23295	23281	23281	Cary	1952	“ How ’d that go ? ”
23306	23332	23296	23296	He	1952	“ I hurt him the other night because I ’m an asshole . Then I hurt him again yesterday trying to do the right thing . ”
23333	23340	23341	23341	I	75	“ Did you break it off ? ”
23358	23381	23341	23341	I	75	“ It ’s seriously cooled off . Like on ice . He wants me to be gay , and I ’m not . ”
23425	23433	23419	23419	he	1952	“ I ’m so sorry , Cary . ”
23434	23483	23484	23484	His	1952	“ So am I , because he ’s a great guy . I ’m just not ready for the stress and demands of a complicated relationship right now . I ’m working a lot . I ’m not stable enough yet to be fucked up in the head . ”
23488	23516	23484	23484	His	1952	“ You might want to think about that , too . We just moved out here . We ’ve both still got some settling in to do . ”
23543	23552	23517	23517	I	75	“ Did you talk to Tatiana , too ? ”
23553	23557	23558	23558	His	1952	“ No need . ”
23569	23574	23558	23558	His	1952	“ She ’s easy . ”
23587	23593	23594	23594	he	1952	“ Not just that way , ”
23603	23674	23594	23594	he	1952	“ I mean she does n’t expect anything or make any demands . As long as I suit up and she orgasms at least as many times as I do , she ’s good . I ’m actually okay with her , and not just because she could suck chrome off a bumper . It ’s relaxing being with someone who just wants to have fun and causes no stress . ”
23675	23709	23594	23594	he	1952	“ Gideon knows me . He understands and tries to work around my issues . He ’s working for this , too , Cary . It ’s not easy for him , either . ”
23710	23722	23723	23723	he	484	“ Do you think Cross had a nooner with his ex ? ”
23727	23730	23594	23594	he	1952	“ No . ”
23731	23736	23594	23594	he	1952	“ Are you sure ? ”
23751	23802	23743	23743	I	75	“ Mostly . I think I ’m the one doing it for him now . It ’s pretty hot with us , you know ? But his ex has some kind of hold on him . He says it ’s guilt , but that does n’t explain his brunette fascination . ”
23803	23842	23594	23594	he	1952	“ It explains why you lost it and hit him — her being around again is eating at you . And he still wo n’t tell you what ’s going on . Does that sound healthy to you ? ”
23855	23863	23851	23851	I	75	“ We saw Dr. Petersen last night . ”
23868	23874	23864	23864	His	75	“ How ’d that go ? ”
23875	23896	23924	23924	his	75	“ He did n’t tell us to run far , far away from each other as fast as we can . ”
23897	23907	23864	23864	His	75	“ And if he does ? Will you listen ? ”
23908	23922	23924	23924	his	75	“ I ’m not bailing when things get rough this time . Seriously , Cary”—I
23925	23940	23864	23864	His	75	gaze—“am I really all that far ahead if I ca n’t take any waves ? ”
23941	23950	23924	23924	his	75	“ Baby girl , Cross is a tsunami . ”
23951	23954	23955	23955	I	75	“ Ha ! ”
23972	24000	23963	23963	Cary	1952	“ To tell you the truth , if I do n’t work this out with Gideon , I have doubts I ’ll work it out with anyone . ”
24001	24011	23924	23924	his	75	“ That ’s your shitty self - esteem talking . ”
24012	24023	23963	23963	Cary	1952	“ He knows what I ’m carrying around in me . ”
24024	24028	23924	23924	his	75	“ All right . ”
24034	24038	24029	24029	My	75	“ All right ? ”
24044	24055	24056	24056	He	1952	“ I ’m not sold . But I ’ll deal . ”
24061	24072	24056	24056	He	1952	“ Come on . Let ’s get your hair done . ”
24078	24084	24073	24073	I	75	“ You ’re the best . ”
24092	24102	24085	24085	He	1952	“ And I wo n’t let you forget it . ”
24104	24112	24113	24113	Cary	1952	“ AS FAR AS death traps go , ”
24116	24123	24113	24113	Cary	1952	“ this one ’s pretty swank . ”
24142	24156	24124	24124	I	75	“ You are not going to die . Flying is safer than driving . ”
24157	24174	24178	24178	him	1952	“ And you do n’t think the airline industry paid for the compilation of those statistics ? ”
24338	24349	24350	24350	he	1952	“ Mr. Cross is expected within the next ten minutes , ”
24353	24366	24350	24350	he	1952	“ In the meantime , can I serve you something to drink ? ”
24367	24374	24375	24375	I	75	“ Water for me , please . ”
24388	24392	24393	24393	Cary	1952	“ Bloody Mary , ”
24396	24403	24393	24393	Cary	1952	“ if you ’ve got it . ”
24408	24414	24404	24405	The steward	491	“ We ’ve got everything . ”
24420	24451	24415	24415	Cary	1952	“ What ? I have n’t had dinner . The tomato juice will hold me over until we eat , and the alcohol will help the Dramamine kick in faster . ”
24452	24459	24460	24460	I	75	“ I did n’t say anything , ”
24771	24776	24777	24777	Cary	1952	“ Uh - oh , ”
24793	24800	24777	24777	Cary	1952	“ You ’ve got that look . ”
24801	24805	24777	24777	Cary	1952	“ What look ? ”
24806	24815	24816	24816	He	1952	“ The hell - on - wheels look . ”
24831	24837	24816	24816	He	1952	“ Wanna talk about it ? ”
24932	24939	24929	24929	I	75	“ He ’s so damn moody . ”
24940	24952	24929	24929	I	75	“ And seriously hot . What he does for that suit … ”
24974	24983	24984	24984	I	75	“ Do n’t distract me with his looks , ”
24987	25000	24929	24929	I	75	“ Give him a blowjob . That ’s a guaranteed mood improver . ”
25001	25007	25040	25040	He	1952	“ Spoken like a man . ”
25008	25014	25015	25015	Cary	1952	“ You expected something different ? ”
25034	25039	25015	25015	Cary	1952	“ Check this out . ”
25056	25062	25040	25040	He	1952	“ Now that ’s swank . ”
25068	25073	25063	25063	My	75	“ For the whales . ”
25074	25077	25040	25040	He	1952	“ What ? ”
25078	25145	25063	25063	My	75	“ Casino high rollers . Gamblers who do n’t blink an eye at dropping a hundred grand or more on the turn of a card . They get a lot of comps to lure them in — food , suites , and travel to and fro . My mom ’s second husband was a whale . It ’s one of the reasons why she left him . ”
25153	25166	25146	25146	He	1952	“ The shit you know . So this is a company jet ? ”
25167	25172	25173	25174	the attendant	500	“ One of five , ”
25186	25189	25190	25190	Cary	1952	“ Jesus , ”
25193	25200	25190	25190	Cary	1952	“ That ’s a damned fleet . ”
25225	25229	25230	25230	he	1952	“ Want some ? ”
25241	25246	25230	25230	he	1952	“ Nope . Thanks . ”
25247	25258	25230	25230	he	1952	“ You gon na deal with Mr. Hot and Moody ? ”
25259	25273	25230	25230	he	1952	“ Not sure . I may just pull out my e - reader . ”
25277	25284	25274	25274	He	1952	“ Probably safer for your sanity . ”
25473	25475	25467	25468	The woman	349	“ concerns ”
25477	25480	25482	25482	Gideon	1324	“ discrepancies , ”
25493	25505	25506	25506	he	1952	“ We ’ll pick this up in the morning , Allison , ”
25528	25536	25537	25537	I	75	“ I ’m the one with PMS , ”
25540	25550	25537	25537	I	75	“ but you ’re the one having mood swings . ”
25577	25590	25551	25551	He	1952	“ And you ’re putting on a striptease to improve my mood ? ”
25591	25623	25624	25624	I	75	“ Ha ! Men are so predictable . Cary suggested I blow you to make you happy . No … do n’t get excited . That ’s not going to happen . ”
25659	25688	25641	25641	I	75	“ I think you owe me , ace . Big - time . I ’ve been an exceptionally understanding girlfriend under the circumstances , do n’t you think ? ”
25693	25707	25708	25708	I	75	“ I mean , I ’d like to see what you would do , ”
25712	25756	25708	25708	I	75	“ if you came over to my place and caught an ex - boyfriend stepping outside still tucking his shirt in his pants . Then , when you came upstairs , you found my couch messed up and me fresh from a shower . ”
25762	25774	25757	25757	Gideon	1324	“ Neither of us wants to see what I ’d do . ”
25775	25792	25793	25793	I	75	“ So we ’re both agreed that I ’ve been pretty damn awesome under extraordinary circumstances . ”
25808	25831	25793	25793	I	75	“ You ’ve made it very clear how you ’d choose to punish me . How would you choose to reward me ? ”
25832	25838	25839	25839	he	1324	“ Is it my choice ? ”
25851	25854	25848	25848	I	75	“ No . ”
25874	25888	25855	25855	He	1324	“ Then that ’s your reward , angel . What do you want ? ”
25889	25901	25855	25855	He	1324	“ I want you to stop being grumpy , for starters . ”
25902	25905	25906	25906	His	1324	“ Grumpy ? ”
25914	25934	25906	25906	His	1324	“ Well , I woke up without you , and now I face two more mornings of the same . ”
25956	25964	25935	25935	I	75	“ Is that really all it is ? ”
25965	25968	25969	25969	He	1324	“ Eva . ”
26026	26031	26016	26016	Gideon	1324	“ Talk to me . ”
26032	26041	26013	26013	his	1324	“ I feel like you ’re pulling away . ”
26052	26073	26016	26016	Gideon	1324	“ I ’ve got a lot on my mind . That does n’t mean I ’m not thinking about you . ”
26074	26092	26016	26016	Gideon	1324	“ I feel it , Gideon . There ’s distance between us that was n’t there before . ”
26105	26121	26093	26093	His	1324	“ There ’s no distance . You ’ve got me by the throat , Eva . ”
26127	26134	26093	26093	His	1324	“ Ca n’t you feel that ? ”
26179	26182	26183	26183	he	1324	“ Sometimes , ”
26193	26199	26183	26183	he	1324	“ I can hardly breathe . ”
26345	26353	26336	26336	He	1324	“ What do you need , Eva ? ”
26354	26361	26336	26336	He	1324	“ You — a mile high . ”
26391	26405	26379	26379	His	1324	“ What is it with you , sex , and modes of transportation ? ”
26406	26418	26419	26419	I	75	“ I ’ll take you any way I can get you , ”
26433	26453	26419	26419	I	75	“ It ’ll probably be next weekend before I ’m good to go again , thanks to my period . ”
26454	26457	26467	26467	his	1324	“ Fuck . ”
26458	26464	26419	26419	I	75	“ That ’s the idea . ”
26483	26488	26489	26489	My	75	“ OH , God . ”
26601	26606	26607	26607	I	75	“ I ’m ready . ”
26659	26668	26700	26700	I	75	“ I ’ll decide when you ’re ready . ”
26669	26675	26700	26700	I	75	“ I want you inside — ”
26696	26699	26700	26700	I	75	“ Gideon ! ”
26747	26754	26756	26756	his	1324	“ You ’re so sensitive now . ”
26764	26771	26756	26756	his	1324	“ You ’re coming like crazy . ”
26775	26786	26772	26772	I	75	“ I ’d come harder if you were inside me . ”
26787	26795	26772	26772	I	75	“ I ’ll keep that in mind . ”
26796	26809	26810	26810	I	75	“ It does n’t matter if I get a little sore now , ”
26813	26821	26810	26810	I	75	“ I ’ll have days to recover . ”
26834	26839	26831	26831	He	1324	“ No , Eva . ”
26871	26875	26876	26876	I	75	“ My choice , ”
26902	26913	26893	26893	His	1324	“ You really want to play that card , angel ? ”
26914	26922	26893	26893	His	1324	“ If that ’s what it takes . ”
26923	26937	26938	26938	His	1324	“ It ’ll take more than that for me to hurt you deliberately . ”
26958	26969	26938	26938	His	1324	“ For us , pain and pleasure are mutually exclusive . ”
26970	26976	26893	26893	His	1324	“ I did n’t mean — ”
26977	26984	26985	26985	He	1324	“ I know what you meant . ”
27014	27032	26985	26985	He	1324	“ You ache without my cock inside you . You ’ll say anything to have me there . ”
27033	27036	27037	27037	He	1324	“ Yes . ”
27085	27096	27066	27066	he	1324	“ You crave it . You feel empty without it . ”
27097	27103	27104	27104	I	75	“ Yes , damn you . ”
27176	27243	27157	27157	He	1324	“ It hurts you a little when I push all the way in , and there ’s no help for that — you have a tight little cunt and I cram you full . Sometimes I lose control and get rough , and there ’s no help for that , either . But do n’t ever ask me to hurt you deliberately . I ca n’t . ”
27244	27249	27250	27250	I	75	“ I want you , ”
27266	27270	27271	27271	He	1324	“ Not yet . ”
27319	27326	27308	27308	I	75	“ You ’re not ready yet . ”
27327	27337	27338	27338	He	1324	“ Fuck me . God … just fuck me ! ”
27362	27367	27360	27360	him	1324	“ You ’re swollen . ”
27415	27421	27407	27407	I	75	“ Give it to me . ”
27440	27445	27422	27422	Gideon	1324	“ Look at me . ”
27446	27449	27456	27456	I	75	“ Gideon ! ”
27450	27455	27422	27422	Gideon	1324	“ Look at me . ”
27587	27590	27591	27591	He	1324	“ Eva . ”

27815	27818	27819	27819	he	1324	“ Crossfire , ”
27846	27850	27851	27851	Gideon	1324	“ Feel that ? ”
27868	27887	27851	27851	Gideon	1324	“ You ’ve got me by the throat and the balls . Where ’s the distance , angel ? ”
27918	27922	27923	27923	he	1324	“ Hell yeah , ”
27938	27954	27923	27923	he	1324	“ Look at the size of this place . You could do cartwheels in here . ”
28021	28033	28034	28034	Cary	1952	“ Why are there always pianos in high - roller suites ? ”
28211	28217	28220	28220	him	1952	“ Still want a cheeseburger ? ”
28236	28245	28220	28220	him	1952	“ And a beer . Make that two . ”
28328	28340	28341	28341	he	1952	“ You never eat a massive pile of carbs this late , ”
28346	28352	28341	28341	he	1952	“ My period ’s coming . ”
28353	28369	28341	28341	he	1952	“ I ’m sure the workout you got on the way here helped , too . ”
28377	28388	28370	28370	I	75	“ How would you know ? You were passed out . ”
28389	28422	28341	28341	he	1952	“ Deductive reasoning , baby girl . When I went to sleep , you looked irritated . When I woke up , you looked like you ’d just smoked a fat joint . ”
28423	28429	28370	28370	I	75	“ How did Gideon look ? ”
28430	28444	28341	28341	he	1952	“ He looked the same — tight - assed and hot as hell . ”
28453	28459	28445	28445	I	75	“ That ’s not fair . ”
28460	28464	28465	28465	He	1952	“ Who cares ? ”
28470	28478	28465	28465	He	1952	“ Look how he puts you up . ”
28479	28490	28445	28445	I	75	“ I do n’t need a sugar daddy , Cary . ”
28498	28533	28491	28491	He	1952	“ Have you thought any more about what you do need ? You ’ve got his time , his rockin ’ bod , and access to everything he owns . That ’s not bad . ”
28534	28537	28538	28538	I	75	“ No , ”
28583	28595	28618	28618	He	1952	“ It ’s not bad . It ’s just not enough . ”
28596	28602	28603	28603	Cary	1952	“ THIS is the life , ”
28643	28659	28618	28618	He	1952	“ The only thing missing is a mojito . Got ta have alcohol to celebrate . ”
28697	28703	28690	28690	I	75	“ What are we celebrating ? ”
28704	28707	28687	28687	Cary	1952	“ Summer . ”
28708	28713	28714	28714	I	75	“ Okay , then . ”
29011	29017	29019	29019	my	75	“ What are you drinking ? ”
29033	29044	29022	29022	I	75	“ Nothing yet , but I ’m considering a mojito . ”
29045	29052	29053	29053	He	539	“ Let me buy you one . ”
29083	29086	29064	29064	He	539	“ Daniel . ”
29094	29102	29087	29087	I	75	“ Eva . Nice to meet you . ”
29115	29126	29103	29103	He	539	“ What brings you to Vegas ? Business or pleasure ? ”
29127	29133	29134	29134	Daniel	104	“ R and R. You ? ”
29184	29187	29176	29182	a man than just his physical features	543	“ Work . ”
29197	29205	29188	29188	I	75	“ I ’ve got the wrong job . ”
29206	29210	29230	29230	She	545	“ I sell — ”
29211	29215	29188	29188	I	75	“ Excuse me . ”
29273	29277	29278	29278	She	545	“ Miss Tramell . ”
29289	29292	29278	29278	She	545	“ Yes ? ”
29293	29307	29328	29328	Sheila	106	“ There ’s a server who can take your order by your cabana . ”
29308	29321	29278	29278	She	545	“ Cool , thanks . But I do n’t mind waiting here . ”
29335	29363	29328	29328	Sheila	106	“ If you ’ll move to the other end of the bar , sir , the bartender will see that your next drinks are on the house . ”
29376	29386	29364	29364	He	104	“ I ’m good here , too , thanks . ”
29387	29397	29364	29364	He	104	“ I ’m afraid I ’ll have to insist . ”
29398	29401	29402	29402	His	104	“ What ? ”
29409	29412	29402	29402	His	104	“ Why ? ”
29450	29463	29441	29441	Sheila	106	“ I ’ll escort you back to your cabana , Miss Tramell . ”
29523	29528	29529	29529	I	75	“ Sorry , Daniel , ”
29548	29555	29536	29536	I	75	“ It was nice meeting you . ”
29559	29566	29556	29556	He	548	“ If you change your mind … ”
29589	29615	29585	29585	I	75	“ So , is getting hit on the only time you ’re instructed to step in ? Or do you have a list of situations ? ”
29653	29659	29629	29629	she	106	“ There ’s a list . ”
29660	29666	29667	29667	Gideon	1324	“ Of course there is . ”
29739	29746	29747	29747	I	75	“ Un - fucking - believable , ”
29776	29783	29772	29772	she	106	“ I ’ve got a babysitter . ”
29784	29787	29752	29752	she	106	“ What ? ”
29799	29806	29807	29807	he	550	“ That ’s crazy , Eva , ”
29810	29847	29848	29848	I	75	“ No shit . And I ’m not putting up with it . He ’s got to learn that relationships do n’t work that way . And after all the crap he gave me about trust . ”
29854	29876	29848	29848	I	75	“ How much does he trust me , if he ’s got to have someone shadowing me to chase strangers away ? ”
29877	29887	29888	29888	He	550	“ I ’m not down with this , Eva . ”
29902	29908	29888	29888	He	550	“ This is n’t okay . ”
29909	29961	29848	29848	I	75	“ You think I do n’t know that ? And what ’s with her being a woman ? Nothing against my gender and tough jobs . I ’m just wondering if he expects her to follow me into ladies ’ rooms or just does n’t trust a guy to watch me . ”
29962	29981	29888	29888	He	550	“ Are you serious ? Why the hell are you sunbathing instead of chewing him a new one ? ”
29995	30000	29984	29984	I	75	“ I ’m plotting . ”
30001	30004	30005	30005	His	550	“ Oh ? ”
30013	30017	30005	30005	His	550	“ Do tell . ”
30049	30058	30059	30059	I	75	“ Hey , Clancy . It ’s Eva , ”
30078	30081	30070	30070	Cary	1952	“ Ooh … ”
30098	30103	30104	30104	I	75	“ Everything ’s fine , ”
30133	30144	30123	30123	Sheila	106	“ Listen , I have a favor to ask you . ”
30172	30177	30163	30165	the Caller ID	362	“ Hi , Daddy ! ”
30181	30187	30178	30178	He	1952	“ How ’s my girl ? ”
30188	30195	30196	30196	I	75	“ Causing trouble and enjoying it . ”
30211	30216	30196	30196	I	75	“ How are you ? ”
30217	30227	30196	30196	I	75	“ Stopping trouble from happening and occasionally enjoying it . ”
30368	30373	30374	30374	I	75	“ I miss you , ”
30409	30454	30385	30385	she	293	“ You might be happy about my news , then . I can come out and see you in about two weeks — the week after this upcoming one — if that works for you . I do n’t want to put you out . ”
30455	30476	30396	30398	a rocky one	561	“ Oh my God , Dad . You could never put me out . I ’d love to see you ! ”
30477	30503	30385	30385	she	293	“ It ’ll be a short trip . I ’d come in on the red - eye Thursday night and fly out again Sunday evening . ”
30504	30522	30396	30398	a rocky one	561	“ I ’m stoked ! Yay ! I ’ll make plans . We ’ll have a blast . ”
30534	30556	30523	30524	My dad	559	“ I ’m coming to see you , not New York . Do n’t go crazy with any sightseeing or anything . ”
30557	30580	30585	30588	the two of them	564	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll make sure we have lots of downtime . And you ’ll get to meet Gideon . ”
30595	30607	30523	30524	My dad	559	“ Gideon Cross ? You said nothing was going on there . ”
30608	30611	30612	30612	I	75	“ Yeah . ”
30617	30634	30612	30612	I	75	“ We ’d hit a rough spot at the time . I thought we were over . ”
30640	30645	30612	30612	I	75	“ Is it serious ? ”
30679	30709	30667	30667	Gideon	1324	“ Yes . It ’s not always easy . It ’s a lot of work — I’m a lot of work — but we ’re both making the effort . ”
30710	30718	30719	30720	My dad	559	“ Does he appreciate you , Eva ? ”
30730	30751	30719	30720	My dad	559	“ I do n’t care how much money he has ; you do n’t have anything to prove to him . ”
30752	30759	30760	30760	I	75	“ It ’s not like that ! ”
30802	30814	30789	30790	My dad	559	“ You ’ll see how it is when you meet him . ”
30815	30819	30820	30820	Skepticism	113	“ All right . ”
30825	30830	30831	30831	I	75	“ Really , Dad . ”
30911	30922	30892	30893	my dad	559	“ Gideon ’s good for me . He gets me . ”
30923	30957	30982	30982	I	75	“ I ’ll keep an open mind , okay ? And I ’ll e - mail you a copy of my itinerary when I book the flight . How ’s everything else going ? ”
30958	30972	30892	30893	my dad	559	“ We just started working on a campaign for blueberry - flavored coffee . ”
30976	30981	30982	30982	I	75	“ You ’re kidding . ”
30985	31010	30982	30982	I	75	“ If only . Wish us luck trying to sell that ! I ’ll be sure to stock some up for you to try . ”
31011	31018	30982	30982	I	75	“ I thought you loved me . ”
31019	31038	30982	30982	I	75	“ With all my heart . How ’s your love life going ? Did your date go well ? ”
31039	31047	30982	30982	I	75	“ Yeah … it was n’t bad . ”
31053	31062	31050	31050	I	75	“ Are you going to see her again ? ”
31063	31071	30982	30982	I	75	“ That ’s the plan so far . ”
31072	31082	31050	31050	I	75	“ You ’re a font of information , Dad . ”
31097	31113	31083	31083	He	75	“ You do n’t really want to know about your old man ’s love life . ”
31114	31117	31119	31119	I	75	“ True . ”
31255	31259	31260	31260	he	1952	“ Still plotting ? ”
31266	31285	31263	31263	I	75	“ All done . That was my dad . He ’s coming out to New York next week . ”
31286	31296	31263	31263	I	75	“ Really ? Rock on . Victor ’s cool . ”
31390	31405	31406	31406	Cary	1952	“ When ’s the last time your parents were in the same state together ? ”
31420	31427	31406	31406	Cary	1952	“ Let alone the same city . ”
31432	31443	31430	31430	God	1648	“ I ’m not sure . Before I was born ? ”
31456	31466	31430	31430	God	1648	“ I ’m not planning on putting them together . ”
31467	31476	31477	31477	He	1324	“ Here ’s to best - laid plans . ”
31486	31529	31477	31477	He	1324	“ Speaking of which , I was considering a quick bang with a chick I met at the pool , but I came up here instead . Figured you and I ’d both go without today and just spend the time together . ”
31530	31535	31536	31536	I	75	“ I ’m honored , ”
31540	31549	31536	31536	I	75	“ I was going to come back down . ”
31550	31560	31477	31477	He	1324	“ Too hot out . That sun is brutal . ”
31561	31574	31536	31536	I	75	“ Same sun we have in New York , is n’t it ? ”
31575	31580	31581	31581	His	1324	“ Smart - ass . ”
31586	31602	31581	31581	His	1324	“ How about we clean up and go out to lunch somewhere ? My treat . ”
31603	31619	31536	31536	I	75	“ Sure . But I ca n’t say Sheila wo n’t insist on tagging along . ”
31620	31637	31581	31581	His	1324	“ Fuck her and her boss . What is it with rich people and control issues ? ”
31638	31647	31536	31536	I	75	“ They get rich because they take control . ”
31648	31666	31667	31667	He	1324	“ Whatever . I prefer our kind of crazy — we pretty much only screw with ourselves . ”
31680	31690	31667	31667	He	1324	“ You gon na put up with his bullshit ? ”
31691	31694	31743	31743	Gideon	1324	“ Depends . ”
31695	31699	31667	31667	He	1324	“ On what ? ”
31710	31723	31700	31700	I	75	“ Get ready . I ’ll tell you about it over lunch . ”
31931	31936	31904	31904	He	1324	“ Hi , angel . ”
31954	31959	31960	31960	His	1324	“ Hi , ace . ”
31969	31979	31960	31960	His	1324	“ Is there a particular meaning behind that endearment ? ”
31980	32011	31960	31960	His	1324	“ Well … you ace everything you do . And it ’s the nickname of a fictional character I have a crush on . You remind me of him sometimes . ”
32012	32032	31960	31960	His	1324	“ I ’m not sure I like you having a crush on anyone but me , fictional or not . ”
32033	32040	31960	31960	His	1324	“ You ’ll get over it . ”
32050	32064	32045	32045	he	1324	“ Like I ’ll get over the sumo wrestler you have shadowing me ? ”
32128	32134	32109	32109	I	75	“ Where ’s Cary going ? ”
32135	32147	32114	32115	a man	365	“ Downstairs to play with the credit I arranged for him . ”
32148	32156	32109	32109	I	75	“ We ’re not leaving right away ? ”
32214	32220	32205	32205	his	365	“ You on your period ? ”
32224	32236	32221	32221	I	75	“ Then I ’ll just have to come in your mouth . ”
32241	32246	32237	32237	My	75	“ Is that right ? ”
32247	32252	32253	32253	His	75	“ Oh , yeah . ”
32257	32272	32253	32253	His	75	“ Do n’t worry , angel . I ’ll take care of you first . ”
32337	32342	32343	32343	I	75	“ I missed you , ”
32354	32363	32343	32343	I	75	“ Even though you ’re seriously irritating sometimes . ”
32367	32381	32364	32364	Gideon	1324	“ You ’re the most exasperating , infuriating woman I ’ve ever met . ”
32382	32402	32364	32364	Gideon	1324	“ Yeah , well , you pissed me off . I ’m not a possession . You ca n’t — ”
32403	32409	32410	32410	He	75	“ Yes , you are . ”
32428	32435	32410	32410	He	75	“ And yes , I can . ”
32436	32449	32364	32364	Gideon	1324	“ Then you are , too . And I can , too . ”
32450	32478	32410	32410	He	75	“ So you demonstrated . Have any idea how difficult it is to do business with someone when they ca n’t get within three feet of you ? ”
32496	32508	32479	32479	I	75	“ Why would someone need to be that close to you ? ”
32509	32544	32549	32549	he	75	“ To point out areas of interest on design schematics spread out in front of me and to fit alongside me within camera range for a teleconference — two things you made very difficult . ”
32555	32564	32549	32549	he	75	“ I was working . You were playing . ”
32565	32584	32586	32586	I	75	“ I do n’t care . If it ’s good for me , it ’s good for you . ”
32623	32638	32607	32607	he	75	“ You ’re not going to get a hundred percent equality in this relationship . ”
32639	32646	32607	32607	he	75	“ The hell I ’m not . ”
32673	32678	32679	32679	he	75	“ You ’re not , ”
32734	32747	32731	32731	my	75	“ Stop it . I ca n’t think when you do that . ”
32748	32793	32830	32830	he	75	“ Do n’t think . Just listen , Eva . Who I am and what I ’ve built makes me a target . You know the score , because you know what it ’s like to live with wealth and the attention it attracts . ”
32794	32805	32731	32731	my	75	“ The guy at the bar was n’t a threat . ”
32806	32811	32830	32830	he	75	“ That ’s debatable . ”
32849	32854	32843	32843	I	75	“ Get off me . ”
32855	32862	32863	32863	He	75	“ I ’m comfortable right here . ”
32872	32879	32843	32843	I	75	“ I ’m pissed at you . ”
32880	32885	32886	32886	He	75	“ I can tell . ”
32892	32901	32886	32886	He	75	“ That wo n’t stop you from coming . ”
32916	32925	32909	32909	he	75	“ I ca n’t when I ’m mad ! ”
32926	32930	32931	32931	He	75	“ Prove it . ”
33078	33085	33086	33086	he	75	“ That ’s it , angel , ”
33089	33105	33086	33086	he	75	“ Feel how hard I am for you ? Feel what you do to me ? ”
33106	33115	33116	33116	I	75	“ Do n’t use sex to punish me , ”
33155	33163	33142	33142	his	75	“ I ’m not mad , angel . ”
33164	33173	33126	33126	He	75	“ Whatever . You ’re pushing me around . ”
33174	33194	33142	33142	his	75	“ And you ’re driving me insane . You know what happened when I realized what you ’d done ? ”
33203	33206	33195	33195	I	75	“ What ? ”
33207	33212	33142	33142	his	75	“ I got hard . ”
33218	33223	33224	33224	He	75	“ Inconveniently and publicly . ”
33243	33272	33273	33273	His	75	“ I had to drag out a finished discussion while I waited for it to go down . It turns me on when you challenge me , Eva . ”
33286	33303	33273	33273	His	75	“ It makes me want to fuck you . For a very , very long time . ”
33304	33307	33308	33308	My	75	“ God . ”
33322	33329	33330	33330	he	75	“ And since I ca n’t , ”
33333	33354	33330	33330	he	75	“ I ’m going to get you off like this , then watch you return the favor with your mouth . ”
33405	33410	33411	33411	he	75	“ That ’s it , ”
33414	33432	33411	33411	he	75	“ keep rubbing your cunt against me like that . Christ , you ’re so damn hot . ”
33433	33436	33437	33437	My	75	“ Gideon . ”
33525	33530	33503	33503	He	75	“ Now , Eva . ”
33599	33602	33603	33603	he	1324	“ Yes , ”
33617	33629	33603	33603	he	1324	“ Suck it hard and fast ; I want to come . ”
33730	33735	33736	33736	He	1324	“ Ah , God . ”
33745	33762	33736	33736	He	1324	“ I love the way you suck me off . Like you ca n’t get enough . ”
33919	33935	33936	33936	His	1324	“ That ’s it , angel . Milk it … make me come for you . ”
33947	33950	33936	33936	His	1324	“ Fuck . ”
34066	34073	34057	34057	he	1324	“ Needed that . Thank you . ”
34081	34087	34074	34074	I	75	“ My pleasure , ace . ”
34088	34093	34094	34094	he	1324	“ I missed you , ”
34105	34116	34094	34094	he	1324	“ So damn much . And not just for this . ”
34117	34121	34122	34122	We	601	“ I know . ”
34156	34167	34168	34168	He	1324	“ My dad ’s coming out to visit next week . ”
34181	34196	34175	34175	he	1324	“ You have to tell me that while my dick ’s still hanging out ? ”
34200	34208	34197	34197	I	75	“ Caught you with your pants down ? ”
34209	34212	34213	34213	He	1324	“ Hell . ”
34231	34256	34213	34213	He	1324	“ You have an idea of how you want the first meeting to go ? Dinner out or in ? Your place or mine ? ”
34257	34265	34266	34266	I	75	“ I ’ll cook at my place . ”
34311	34318	34319	34319	I	75	“ Would you prefer something different ? ”
34322	34343	34298	34309	the grim - faced man who ’d been around more frequently lately	602	“ No . It ’s a good plan and what I would ’ve suggested . He ’ll feel comfortable there . ”
34344	34348	34394	34394	I	75	“ Will you ? ”
34349	34352	34353	34353	He	602	“ Yes . ”
34374	34393	34353	34353	He	602	“ I ’d rather not hit him in the face with my money if we can help it . ”
34400	34459	34394	34394	I	75	“ I had n’t considered that . I just thought I ’d be less anxious about making a mess in my own kitchen than in yours . But you ’re right . It ’ll be okay , though , Gideon . Once he sees how you feel about me , he ’ll be good with us being together . ”
34460	34487	34500	34500	He	603	“ I only care what he thinks if it affects how you feel . If he does n’t like me and that changes something between us — ”
34488	34499	34394	34394	I	75	“ You ’re the only one who can do that . ”
34571	34581	34566	34566	I	75	“ Did you get everything worked out in Phoenix ? ”
34582	34616	34617	34617	I	75	“ Yes . One of the project managers noted some anomalies in accounting , and she was right to push me to look deeper into it . Embezzling is n’t something I tolerate . ”
34637	34643	34622	34624	Gideon ’s father	559	“ What ’s the project ? ”
34644	34649	34566	34566	I	75	“ A golf resort . ”
34650	34677	34678	34678	I	75	“ Nightclubs , resorts , luxury living , vodka , casinos … with a chain of gyms thrown in to keep fit for the high life ? ”
34707	34719	34678	34678	I	75	“ You ’re a pleasure god in more ways than one . ”
34720	34724	34725	34725	His	1324	“ Pleasure god ? ”
34731	34740	34725	34725	His	1324	“ I spend all my energy worshipping you . ”
34741	34751	34752	34752	I	75	“ How did you get to be so rich ? ”
34778	34793	34752	34752	I	75	“ People like to have fun , and they ’ll pay for the privilege . ”
34794	34821	34752	34752	I	75	“ That ’s not what I meant . How did you get Cross Industries started ? Where did you get the capital to get things going ? ”
34830	34839	34822	34822	His	1324	“ Where do you think I got it ? ”
34840	34846	34847	34847	I	75	“ I have no idea , ”
34852	34855	34822	34822	His	1324	“ Blackjack . ”
34859	34866	34856	34856	I	75	“ Gambling ? Are you kidding ? ”
34867	34870	34871	34871	He	1324	“ No . ”
34947	34952	34945	34945	me	75	“ You count cards . ”
34953	34958	34959	34959	he	1324	“ When I played , ”
34962	34985	34959	34959	he	1324	“ I do n’t anymore . And the contacts I made over card tables were as instrumental as the money I made . ”
35005	35015	34986	34986	I	75	“ Remind me not to play cards with you . ”
35016	35023	35074	35074	Gideon	1324	“ Strip poker could be fun . ”
35024	35028	34986	34986	I	75	“ For you . ”
35037	35052	35029	35029	He	1324	“ And for you . You know how I get when you ’re naked . ”
35065	35073	35053	35053	I	75	“ And when I ’m not naked . ”
35084	35090	35074	35074	Gideon	1324	“ Do you still gamble ? ”
35091	35103	35074	35074	Gideon	1324	“ Every day . But only in business and with you . ”
35104	35112	35074	35074	Gideon	1324	“ With me ? With our relationship ? ”
35132	35143	35144	35144	His	1324	“ You ’re the greatest risk I ’ve ever taken . ”
35152	35158	35144	35144	His	1324	“ And the greatest reward . ”
35410	35416	35437	35438	a winner	615	“ Good morning , Eva . ”
35440	35452	35431	35431	His	73	“ Hey . I ’m ready to roll when you are . ”
35453	35463	35480	35480	We	616	“ Coffee first . You up for a refill ? ”
35475	35479	35472	35472	I	75	“ You bet . ”
35487	35496	35497	35497	Mark	73	“ You look like you got a tan , ”
35505	35543	35497	35497	Mark	73	“ Yeah , I did a little sun lounging over the weekend . It was good to be lazy and do nothing . Actually , that ’s probably one of my favorite things to do , period . ”
35544	35568	35638	35638	I	75	“ I ’m envious . Steven ca n’t sit still for too long . He always wants to drag me somewhere for something . ”
35569	35585	35497	35497	Mark	73	“ My roommate ’s the same way . It ’s exhausting how he runs around . ”
35586	35593	35594	35594	He	73	“ Oh , before I forget . ”
35605	35637	35594	35594	He	73	“ Shawna wants you to get in touch . She ’s got concert tickets for some new rock band . I think she wants to see if you ’d want them . ”
35699	35710	35717	35717	she	618	“ Are you okay with me reaching out to her ? ”
35739	35753	35717	35717	she	618	“ Of course . Do n’t worry . It wo n’t be weird . ”
35754	35758	35759	35759	I	75	“ All right . ”
35775	35778	35765	35766	another girlfriend	622	“ Thanks . ”
35779	35788	35789	35789	he	73	“ Thank me with a cup of coffee , ”
35805	35815	35789	35789	he	73	“ You make it taste better than I do . ”
35822	35829	35816	35816	I	75	“ My dad uses that line . ”
35830	35837	35765	35766	another girlfriend	622	“ Must be true , then . ”
35838	35846	35847	35847	I	75	“ Must be a standard guy finagle , ”
35851	35862	35847	35847	I	75	“ How do you and Steven divvy up coffee making ? ”
35863	35868	35869	35869	He	73	“ We do n’t . ”
35872	35884	35869	35869	He	73	“ There ’s a Starbucks on the corner by our place . ”
35885	35911	35912	35912	I	75	“ I ’m sure there ’s a way to call that cheating , but I have n’t had enough caffeine to think of it yet . ”
35921	35937	35912	35912	I	75	“ Which probably means I should n’t share the idea that just came to me . ”
35938	35956	35869	35869	He	73	“ Go for it . If it really sucks , I can hold it against you forever . ”
35957	35962	35963	35963	I	75	“ Gee . Thanks . ”
35971	36031	35963	35963	I	75	“ Would it work to market the blueberry coffee like tea instead ? You know , the coffee in a chintz teacup and saucer with maybe a scone and some clotted cream in the background ? Give it a high - end , midafternoon snack sort of treatment ? Throw in a fabulously handsome Englishman to sip it with ? ”
36042	36058	36032	36032	Mark	73	“ I think I like it . Let ’s go run it by the creatives . ”
36059	36073	36074	36074	I	75	“ WHY did n’t you tell me you were going to Las Vegas ? ”
36150	36170	36143	36143	she	233	“ Hi , Mom . I ’m sorry . I planned on calling you at lunch and catching up . ”
36171	36176	36143	36143	she	233	“ I love Vegas . ”
36177	36181	36182	36182	I	75	“ You do ? ”
36192	36199	36182	36182	I	75	“ I did n’t know that . ”
36200	36209	36143	36143	she	233	“ You would ’ve if you ’d asked . ”
36226	36233	36234	36234	I	75	“ I ’m sorry , Mom , ”
36253	36283	36234	36234	I	75	“ I needed to spend some downtime with Cary . We can talk about a future trip to Vegas , though , if you ’d like to go sometime . ”
36284	36303	36327	36329	a beautiful woman	233	“ Would n’t that be fun ? I ’d like to do fun things with you , Eva . ”
36304	36312	36313	36313	My	75	“ I ’d like that , too . ”
36381	36399	36375	36375	she	233	“ Do you have plans for lunch ? I could make a reservation and come get you . ”
36400	36409	36410	36410	Megumi	70	“ Can I bring a co - worker ? ”
36437	36451	36433	36433	her	233	“ Oh , I ’d love to meet the people you work with ! ”
36506	36535	36488	36488	her	233	“ Okay . Pick us up at noon . And remember , we only get an hour , so it ’ll have to be close by and quick . ”
36536	36552	36594	36596	a stunning woman	78	“ I ’ll take care of it . I ’m excited ! See you soon . ”
36747	36761	36762	36762	Megumi	70	“ I ’m still trying to figure out what ’s wrong with him , ”
36766	36791	36762	36762	Megumi	70	“ I was looking , let me tell you . I mean a guy that great should n’t be slumming it with blind dates . ”
36792	36797	36798	36799	my mom	233	“ Hardly slumming it , ”
36802	36816	36798	36799	my mom	233	“ I ’m sure he ’s wondering how he lucked out with you . ”
36817	36820	36821	36821	Megumi	70	“ Thanks ! ”
36826	36843	36821	36821	Megumi	70	“ He was seriously hot . Not Gideon Cross hot , but hot all the same . ”
36844	36853	36821	36821	Megumi	70	“ How is Gideon , by the way ? ”
36978	36984	36985	36985	I	75	“ He ’s working hard , ”
36988	37019	36985	36985	I	75	“ You know how it is . I ’ve taken up a lot of his time since we hooked up , and I think he ’s paying for it now . ”
37020	37026	37027	37027	I	75	“ You ’re worth it . ”
37154	37169	37170	37170	she	233	“ I saw a picture of Cary on the side of a bus yesterday , ”
37173	37176	37177	37177	I	75	“ Really ? ”
37182	37185	37177	37177	I	75	“ Where ? ”
37186	37199	37170	37170	she	233	“ On Broadway . A jeans ad , I think it was . ”
37200	37207	37208	37208	Megumi	70	“ I saw one , too , ”
37211	37229	37208	37208	Megumi	70	“ Not that I paid any attention to what he was wearing . That man is fine . ”
37274	37284	37285	37285	I	75	“ He ’s been getting recognized on the street , ”
37326	37330	37331	37332	my mom	293	“ Of course , ”
37342	37351	37331	37332	my mom	293	“ You did n’t doubt he would eventually ? ”
37352	37357	37358	37358	I	75	“ I ’d hoped , ”
37361	37388	37358	37358	I	75	“ For his sake . It ’s a sad fact that male models do n’t make as much or work as often as the women do . ”
37549	37552	37553	37553	Monica	78	“ So , ”
37558	37568	37553	37553	Monica	78	“ will you be seeing your blind date again ? ”
37569	37574	37553	37553	Monica	78	“ I hope so . ”
37575	37585	37553	37553	Monica	78	“ Darling , do n’t leave it to chance ! ”
37692	37697	37698	37698	Megumi	70	“ Your mom rocks , ”
37716	37743	37702	37702	Monica	78	“ And you look just like her , lucky you . How bad would it suck to have a mom who ’s hotter than you are ? ”
37750	37767	37746	37746	I	75	“ I ’ll have to drag you along with us again . This worked out great . ”
37768	37774	37702	37702	Monica	78	“ I ’d like that . ”
37814	37825	37826	37826	I	75	“ I think I ’m going to hoof it back , ”
37830	37843	37826	37826	I	75	“ I ate too much . You two go on without me . ”
37844	37851	37852	37852	Megumi	70	“ I ’ll go with you , ”

38442	38474	38434	38435	Parker Smith	124	“ You ’re wasting my time . If you ’re going to be here , be here . One hundred percent . Not a million miles away in your head somewhere . ”

39502	39540	39494	39494	he	448	“ Give it all a rest ? I just want to be with you , all right ? Order something in for dinner , watch TV , hold you when I sleep . Can we do that ? ”
39553	39558	39547	39547	I	75	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
39559	39568	39494	39494	he	448	“ I just want some time with you . ”

40971	40982	40947	40947	his	1324	“ Cross called . Said he ’d had another nightmare . ”
40983	40987	40988	40988	I	75	“ Nothing happened . ”
40998	41008	40947	40947	his	1324	“ You look like something happened . You look … ”

41083	41090	41091	41091	He	1324	“ What are you waiting for ? ”
41100	41129	41091	41091	He	1324	“ You ’re going to wait too long and then this wo n’t be just another bad relationship , it ’ll be one that permanently fucks you up . ”
41130	41148	41091	41091	He	1324	“ If I give up on him , he ’ll have no one . I ca n’t — ”
41149	41170	41091	41091	He	1324	“ That ’s not your problem . Eva … Goddamn it . It ’s not your responsibility to save him . ”
41171	41180	41181	41181	I	75	“ It ’s — You do n’t understand . ”

42346	42351	42357	42357	I	75	“ Working on it . ”
42874	42877	42878	42878	I	75	“ Hello ? ”

42914	42925	42878	42878	I	75	“ I hope it ’s not too late to call . ”
42953	42963	42951	42951	he	1324	“ No worries . I ’m just watching TV . ”
42964	43001	42878	42878	I	75	“ Sorry I missed your call last night . I know it ’s short notice , but I wanted to see if you ’d be up for going to a Six - Ninths concert on Friday . ”
43002	43007	42951	42951	he	1324	“ A what concert ? ”
43008	43092	42878	42878	I	75	“ Six - Ninths . You have n’t heard of ’em ? They were indie until late last year . I ’ve been following them for a while and they gave their e - mail list first dibs , so I scored tickets . Thing is , everyone I know likes hip - hop and dance pop . Not to say you ’re my last hope , but … well , you ’re my last hope . Tell me you like alt rock . ”
43093	43099	43100	43100	My	75	“ I like alt rock . ”
43143	43150	43151	43151	She	117	“ How did I know that ? ”
43154	43189	43151	43151	She	117	“ I ’ve got four tickets if you ’ve got someone you ’d like to bring along . Meet up at six ? Grab something to eat first ? The show starts at nine . ”
43198	43205	43190	43190	Gideon	1324	“ You ’ve got a date . ”
43299	43311	43312	43312	I	75	“ I ’ll get back to you about the other ticket , ”
43326	43333	43320	43320	I	75	“ Thanks for thinking of me . ”
43334	43352	43312	43312	I	75	“ I ’m just glad you ’re coming ! We ’re going to have a great time . ”
43395	43403	43404	43404	he	1324	“ How long have you been here ? ”
43432	43436	43418	43418	My	75	“ Not long . ”
43437	43442	43443	43443	I	75	“ Have you eaten ? ”
43481	43485	43486	43486	He	1324	“ Order something . ”
43494	43514	43486	43486	He	1324	“ Menus are in the kitchen drawer by the fridge . I ’m going to grab a quick shower . ”
43515	43521	43522	43522	I	75	“ Do you want something ? ”
43537	43547	43528	43528	He	1324	“ Yes . I have n’t eaten , either . ”
43578	43583	43584	43584	I	75	“ Hey , Cary , ”
43602	43624	43584	43584	I	75	“ Hey , Cross was just here looking for you . I told him to go to hell and stay there . ”
43625	43628	43629	43629	I	75	“ Cary . ”
43647	43654	43638	43638	I	75	“ Thanks for letting me know . ”
43655	43660	43584	43584	I	75	“ Where are you ? ”
43661	43684	43638	43638	I	75	“ At his place , waiting for him . He just showed . I ’ll probably be home sooner rather than later . ”
43685	43693	43584	43584	I	75	“ You kicking him to the curb ? ”
43694	43703	43638	43638	I	75	“ I think that ’s on his agenda . ”
43708	43749	43704	43704	He	1324	“ I know it ’s not what you ’re ready for , but it ’s for the best . You should call Dr. Travis ASAP . Talk it out with him . He ’ll help you put things in perspective . ”
43761	43769	43750	43750	I	75	“ I ’m — Yeah . Maybe . ”
43770	43774	43750	43750	I	75	“ You okay ? ”
43775	43793	43750	43750	I	75	“ Ending it face - to - face has dignity , at least . That ’s something . ”
43810	43817	43802	43802	Gideon	1324	“ Good - bye , Cary , ”
43890	43896	43897	43897	he	1324	“ Who ’s the date ? ”
43900	43921	43934	43934	I	75	“ Huh ? Oh . Shawna — Mark ’s sister - in - law — has concert tickets for Friday . ”
43922	43933	43934	43934	I	75	“ Have you figured out what you want to eat ? ”
43954	43965	43966	43966	He	1324	“ Get me a glass of whatever you ’re drinking . ”
43983	43993	43975	43975	I	75	“ I ’ll order . What do you want ? ”
44011	44017	44038	44038	him	1324	“ Soup . Crusty bread . ”
44179	44195	44168	44168	he	1324	“ I went to your place looking for you . I expect Cary told you . ”
44206	44215	44196	44196	I	75	“ I ’m sorry … about this and — ”
44224	44235	44216	44216	I	75	“ Damn it . I did n’t plan this well . ”
44250	44254	44236	44236	He	1324	“ Go on . ”
44255	44290	44291	44291	I	75	“ I figured you ’d be home . I should ’ve called first . When you were n’t here , I should have just waited for another time instead of making myself at home . ”
44298	44315	44291	44291	I	75	“ I ’m … confused about what ’s going on . I ’m not thinking straight . ”
44324	44342	44316	44316	His	1324	“ If you ’re waiting for me to break up with you , you can stop waiting . ”
44363	44370	44371	44371	he	1324	“ I ca n’t do it , ”
44375	44395	44371	44371	he	1324	“ I ca n’t even say I ’ll let you walk , if that ’s why you ’re here . ”
44403	44412	44398	44398	I	75	“ You left your key at my place . ”
44413	44419	44371	44371	he	1324	“ I want it back . ”
44420	44423	44424	44424	My	75	“ Gideon . ”
44434	44440	44424	44424	My	75	“ You ’re an ass . ”
44486	44494	44495	44495	he	734	“ I wo n’t follow you inside , ”
44507	44535	44495	44495	he	734	“ I promised you that . But I ’m asking you to stay and talk to me . At least listen . You came all this way — ”
44536	44543	44548	44548	me	75	“ I have something for you . ”
44576	44592	44573	44573	I	75	“ Were you breaking up with me when you left the key on my counter ? ”
44664	44673	44674	44674	he	734	“ I was n’t thinking that far ahead , ”
44677	44686	44674	44674	he	734	“ I just wanted you to feel safe . ”
44697	44729	44687	44687	My	75	“ You ripped my heart out , Gideon . You have no idea what seeing that key lying there did to me . How bad it hurt me . No idea . ”
44739	44755	44730	44730	His	734	“ I was n’t thinking clearly . I thought I was doing the right thing — ”
44756	44779	44780	44780	My	75	“ Fuck that . Fuck your damn chivalry or whatever the hell you think that was . Do n’t do it again . ”
44787	44831	44780	44780	My	75	“ I ’m telling you right now and I mean it like I ’ve never meant anything before — you ever give me my keys back again , we ’re done . There ’s no coming back from that . Do you understand ? ”
44832	44845	44866	44866	His	75	“ I do , yes . I ’m not sure you do . ”
44859	44865	44855	44855	I	75	“ Give me your hand . ”
44883	44899	44900	44900	I	75	“ I never gave you the key to my place ; you just took it . ”
44916	44925	44900	44900	I	75	“ I ’m giving it to you now . ”
45004	45007	45008	45008	I	75	“ No , ”
45031	45037	45016	45016	I	75	“ Please … do n’t . ”
45049	45059	45038	45038	Gideon	1324	“ I do n’t know how to walk away . ”
45060	45063	45016	45016	I	75	“ Shh . ”
45064	45078	45038	45038	Gideon	1324	“ I ’ll hurt you . I already am . You deserve better — ”
45079	45085	45086	45086	I	75	“ Shut up , Gideon . ”
45100	45108	45109	45109	He	75	“ Cary told me how you looked … ”
45115	45134	45109	45109	He	75	“ You do n’t see what I ’m doing to you . I ’m breaking you , Eva — ”
45135	45141	45142	45142	He	75	“ That ’s not true . ”
45155	45194	45142	45142	He	75	“ I ’ve trapped you in this . You do n’t see it now , but you knew from the beginning — You knew what I would do to you , but I would n’t let you run . ”
45195	45217	45109	45109	He	75	“ I ’m not running anymore . You ’ve made me stronger . You gave me a reason to try harder . ”
45218	45221	45142	45142	He	75	“ God . ”
45239	45276	45227	45227	He	75	“ We ’re so fucked up , and I ’ve handled everything all wrong . We ’re going to kill each other with this . We ’ll tear each other apart until there ’s nothing left . ”
45277	45300	45109	45109	He	75	“ Shut up . I do n’t want to hear any more of that shit . Did you go to Dr. Petersen ? ”
45313	45319	45301	45301	His	75	“ Yes , damn it . ”
45320	45329	45227	45227	He	75	“ Did you tell him about last night ? ”
45330	45333	45334	45334	His	75	“ Yes . ”
45338	45389	45334	45334	His	75	“ And he said the same thing he started on last week . That we ’re in too deep . We ’re drowning each other . He thinks we need to pull back , date platonically , sleep separately , spend more time together with others and less time alone . ”
45408	45417	45452	45452	He	1324	“ I hope he ’s got a Plan B. ”
45429	45438	45418	45418	Gideon	1324	“ That ’s what I said . Again . ”
45439	45451	45452	45452	He	1324	“ So we ’re fucked up . Every relationship has issues . ”
45455	45458	45459	45459	I	75	“ Seriously , ”
45462	45479	45418	45418	Gideon	1324	“ We are going to sleep separately . That ’s something I let go too far . ”
45480	45487	45452	45452	He	1324	“ Separate beds or separate apartments ? ”
45488	45498	45418	45418	Gideon	1324	“ Beds . That ’s all I can stand . ”
45499	45503	45504	45504	I	75	“ All right . ”
45529	45537	45517	45517	he	1324	“ I can deal . For now . ”
45546	45556	45538	45538	His	1324	“ When I came home and found you here — ”
45563	45600	45538	45538	His	1324	“ God , Eva . I thought Cary was lying about you not being home , that you just did n’t want to see me . Then I thought you might be out … moving on . ”
45601	45613	45614	45614	I	75	“ You ’re not that easy to get over , Gideon . ”
45654	45660	45640	45640	He	1324	“ Thank you for this . ”
45661	45668	45669	45669	I	75	“ Do n’t let that go , ”
45673	45682	45683	45683	He	1324	“ Do n’t regret giving it to me . ”
45801	45807	45779	45779	Gideon	1324	“ How did you sleep ? ”
45808	45821	45794	45794	his	1324	“ I missed you . Is that coffee I smell for me ? ”
45822	45828	45779	45779	Gideon	1324	“ If you ’re good . ”
45834	45841	45829	45829	My	75	“ But you like me bad . ”
45874	45890	45868	45868	he	1324	“ I like you bad with me . Tell me about this concert on Friday . ”
45891	45910	45952	45952	He	1324	“ It ’s a band called Six - Ninths . That ’s all I know . Wanna go ? ”
45911	45932	45868	45868	he	1324	“ It ’s not a question of whether I want to go . If you ’re going , so am I. ”
45937	45951	45933	45933	My	75	“ Is that right ? And what if I had n’t asked you ? ”
45967	45977	45952	45952	He	1324	“ Then you would n’t be going , either . ”
45978	45982	45983	45983	I	75	“ Excuse me ? ”
46002	46018	45998	45998	I	75	“ Gimme that coffee . I want to be caffeinated when I kick your ass . ”
46027	46036	46037	46037	I	75	“ Do n’t look at me like that , ”
46040	46056	46037	46037	I	75	“ I ’m seriously not happy with you telling me I ca n’t go somewhere . ”
46057	46102	46019	46019	Gideon	1324	“ We ’re talking specifically about a rock concert , and I did n’t say you could n’t go , just that you ca n’t go without me . I ’m sorry you do n’t like it , but it is what it is . ”
46103	46121	46037	46037	I	75	“ Who says it ’s rock ? Maybe it ’s classical . Or Celtic . Or pop . ”
46122	46131	46019	46019	Gideon	1324	“ Six - Ninths signed with Vidal Records . ”
46132	46135	46037	46037	I	75	“ Oh . ”
46197	46207	46208	46208	he	58	“ I ’ve seen videos of their indie shows , ”
46212	46224	46208	46208	he	58	“ I ’m not risking you to a crowd like that . ”
46234	46247	46225	46225	I	75	“ I get it , but you ca n’t order me around . ”
46248	46255	46256	46256	He	58	“ Ca n’t I ? Shh . ”
46264	46290	46256	46256	He	58	“ Do n’t argue . I ’m not a tyrant . I may occasionally have concerns , and you ’ll be sensible about acknowledging them . ”
46297	46309	46291	46291	I	75	“ ‘ Sensible ’ being whatever you ’ve decided is best ? ”
46310	46314	46321	46321	He	58	“ Of course . ”
46315	46320	46291	46291	I	75	“ That ’s bullshit . ”
46324	46360	46321	46321	He	58	“ We ’re not going to fight over a hypothetical situation . You asked me to go to the concert with you on Friday and I said yes . There ’s nothing to argue about . ”
46379	46404	46368	46368	I	75	“ I have to be able to live my life , Gideon . I still have to be me or this wo n’t work . ”
46405	46424	46430	46430	He	58	“ And I have to be me . I ’m not the only one who needs to compromise . ”
46477	46492	46462	46462	I	75	“ What if I want a girls ’ night out clubbing with my friends ? ”
46505	46518	46493	46493	He	58	“ You can take the limo and stick to clubs I own . ”
46519	46531	46493	46493	He	58	“ So you can have your security people spy on me ? ”
46532	46539	46540	46540	he	58	“ Keep an eye on you , ”
46550	46571	46540	46540	he	58	“ Is that so terrible , angel ? Is it so unforgivable that I hate taking my eyes off you ? ”
46572	46579	46493	46493	He	58	“ Do n’t twist this around . ”
46596	46652	46580	46580	He	58	“ You need to understand that even if you take the limo and stick to my clubs , I ’m still going to go crazy until you get home . If that means you ’re driven a little crazy with my safety precautions , is n’t that part of the give - and - take ? ”
46656	46666	46653	46653	I	75	“ How do you make something unreasonable sound reasonable ? ”
46667	46673	46653	46653	I	75	“ It ’s a gift . ”
46689	46702	46686	46686	I	75	“ I need more coffee to deal with your gift , ace . ”
46777	46786	46787	46787	Shawna	117	“ I ’m so jealous of your tan , ”
46805	46818	46787	46787	Shawna	117	“ The sun just makes me red and gives me more freckles . ”
46819	46832	46833	46833	I	75	“ But you ’ve got that beautiful hair to show for it , ”
46865	46874	46843	46843	Steven	116	“ The things one sacrifices to be hot . ”
46875	46881	46882	46882	Shawna	117	“ How would you know ? ”
47012	47020	47021	47021	Shawna	117	“ I am so excited about Friday . ”
47031	47039	47040	47040	Steven	116	“ Yeah , she ’ll take you , ”
47045	47052	47040	47040	Steven	116	“ and not her big brother . ”
47053	47059	47060	47060	she	117	“ Sooo not your scene , ”
47064	47069	47060	47060	she	117	“ You hate crowds . ”
47070	47083	47040	47040	Steven	116	“ Just got ta establish some personal space , that ’s all . ”
47089	47098	47084	47084	Shawna	117	“ You ca n’t be a bruiser everywhere . ”
47113	47124	47125	47125	I	75	“ Mind if I bring the guy I ’m seeing ? ”
47128	47135	47125	47125	I	75	“ Or is that a buzzkill ? ”
47136	47152	47107	47107	Gideon	1324	“ Not at all . Does he have a friend who ’d like to come ? ”
47153	47156	47157	47157	Mark	73	“ Shawna . ”
47165	47170	47157	47157	Mark	73	“ What about Doug ? ”
47171	47183	47184	47184	She	117	“ What about him ? You did n’t let me finish . ”
47191	47214	47184	47184	She	117	“ Doug ’s my boyfriend . He ’s in Sicily for the summer taking a culinary course . He ’s a chef . ”
47215	47218	47219	47219	I	75	“ Nice , ”
47222	47230	47219	47219	I	75	“ I dig guys who can cook . ”
47231	47236	47237	47237	She	117	“ Oh , yeah . ”
47247	47283	47237	47237	She	117	“ He ’s a keeper and I know it , so if your guy has a friend who ’s fine with filling the empty seat with no possibility of a hookup , bring him along . ”
47569	47577	47578	47578	he	1324	“ Am I neglecting you , angel ? ”
47599	47606	47587	47587	I	75	“ I ’m sorry to interrupt . ”
47607	47619	47626	47626	he	1324	“ You should always come to me when you need something . ”
47644	47648	47626	47626	he	1324	“ Come sit . ”
47709	47730	47700	47700	he	1324	“ I should ’ve explained that I ’m trying to clear my schedule so we can take off this weekend . ”
47731	47734	47735	47735	I	75	“ Really ? ”
47743	47774	47775	47775	His	1324	“ I want you all to myself for a while . And I really , really need to fuck you for a very long time . Maybe the whole time . ”
47783	47790	47775	47775	His	1324	“ I miss being inside you . ”
47791	47798	47799	47799	I	75	“ You ’re always inside me , ”
47816	47823	47802	47802	His	1324	“ You ’re making me hard . ”
47824	47829	47802	47802	His	1324	“ What ’s new ? ”
47830	47833	47802	47802	His	1324	“ Everything . ”
47837	47844	47845	47845	he	1324	“ We ’ll get to that , ”
47848	47861	47845	47845	he	1324	“ For now , tell me what you came in here for . ”
47872	47875	47876	47876	His	1324	“ Eva . ”
47882	47888	47876	47876	His	1324	“ What do you need ? ”
47889	47931	47876	47876	His	1324	“ A date for Shawna . Uh … not really a date . Shawna ’s got a man , but he ’s out of the country . It ’d just be better if we made it an even party of four . ”
47932	47941	47876	47876	His	1324	“ You do n’t want to ask Cary ? ”
47942	47974	47876	47876	His	1324	“ I thought of him first , but Shawna ’s my friend . I thought you might want someone you know to come . You know , keep the dynamic even . ”
47975	47986	47876	47876	His	1324	“ All right . I ’ll see who ’s free . ”
48020	48025	48017	48017	he	754	“ Is there more ? ”
48026	48029	48032	48032	I	75	“ I … ”
48050	48055	48045	48045	I	75	“ No . Nothing . ”
48056	48059	48060	48060	His	754	“ Eva . ”
48065	48069	48060	48060	His	754	“ Tell me . ”
48070	48075	48045	48045	I	75	“ It ’s stupid . ”
48076	48083	48060	48060	His	754	“ That was n’t a request . ”
48103	48117	48096	48096	he	754	“ I just thought you socialized for business and screwed random women occasionally . ”
48145	48154	48155	48155	he	754	“ You did n’t think I had friends ? ”
48161	48170	48171	48171	I	75	“ You ’ve never introduced me to any , ”
48185	48188	48189	48189	His	754	“ Ah … ”
48199	48225	48189	48189	His	754	“ You ’re my sexy little secret . Have to wonder what I was thinking when I made sure we were photographed kissing in public . ”
48226	48229	48230	48230	My	75	“ Well . ”
48260	48268	48230	48230	My	75	“ When you put it like that … ”
48285	48302	48269	48269	Gideon	1324	“ I ’ve introduced you to a few of my friends when we ’ve been out . ”
48303	48306	48307	48307	I	75	“ Oh . ”
48324	48337	48307	48307	I	75	“ But keeping you all to myself is n’t a bad idea . ”
48362	48378	48394	48394	he	1324	“ Why ca n’t you be the one lying around naked waiting to be fucked ? ”
48379	48387	48394	48394	he	1324	“ Where ’s the fun in that ? ”
48459	48466	48467	48467	he	1324	“ It ’d be a pleasure , ”
48477	48495	48467	48467	he	1324	“ to lie around with a hard - on that you rode whenever the mood struck you . ”
48506	48513	48496	48496	My	75	“ You ’re making me horny . ”
48514	48523	48496	48496	My	75	“ Good . I like you that way . ”
48524	48527	48528	48528	I	75	“ So , ”
48531	48546	48528	48528	I	75	“ if my fantasy is you providing around - the - clock stud servicing — ”
48547	48554	48496	48496	My	75	“ Sounds like reality to me . ”
48568	48576	48565	48565	He	1324	“ Want to play rough , angel ? ”
48577	48587	48496	48496	My	75	“ I want to know what your fantasy is . ”
48600	48603	48588	48588	Gideon	1324	“ You . ”
48604	48609	48565	48565	He	1324	“ It better be . ”
48613	48618	48610	48610	He	1324	“ In a swing . ”
48619	48622	48588	48588	Gideon	1324	“ Huh ? ”
48623	48652	48653	48653	He	1324	“ A sex swing , Eva . Your gorgeous ass in a seat , feet in stirrups , legs spread wide , your perfect cunt wet and waiting . ”
48664	48689	48653	48653	He	1324	“ Totally at my mercy and unable to do anything but take all the cum I can give you . You ’d love it . ”
48726	48732	48710	48710	he	1324	“ You want me helpless . ”
48733	48752	48710	48710	he	1324	“ I want you bound . And not on the outside . I ’m working my way in . ”
48753	48756	48710	48710	he	1324	“ Gideon — ”
48757	48770	48771	48771	he	1324	“ I wo n’t ever take it further than you can handle , ”
48783	48793	48771	48771	he	1324	“ But I ’ll take you to the edge . ”
48811	48814	48794	48794	I	75	“ Why ? ”
48815	48834	48835	48835	His	1324	“ Because you want to be mine and I want to possess you . We ’ll get there . ”
48858	48865	48866	48866	I	75	“ Have you done that before ? ”
48870	48874	48866	48866	I	75	“ The swing ? ”
48879	48887	48875	48875	His	1324	“ Do n’t ask questions like that . ”
48891	48895	48889	48889	God	1648	“ I just — ”
49112	49115	49087	49087	His	1324	“ Gideon . ”
49261	49264	49265	49265	He	1324	“ Shh . ”
49279	49289	49265	49265	He	1324	“ You ’re questioning everything and driving yourself crazy . ”
49290	49295	49296	49296	I	75	“ I hate this , ”
49299	49313	49296	49296	I	75	“ I should n’t need you this much . It ’s not healthy . ”
49314	49322	49323	49323	His	1324	“ That ’s where you ’re wrong . ”
49331	49378	49323	49323	His	1324	“ And I take responsibility for that . I ’ve taken the lead with some things and given it to you with others . That ’s left you confused and worried . I ’m sorry about that , angel . It ’ll be easier moving forward . ”
49439	49444	49445	49445	He	1324	“ That ’s better . ”
49450	49490	49445	49445	He	1324	“ I was going to wait until the weekend to talk about this , but now works . We ’re going to come to an agreement . Once it ’s met , there ’s no turning back . Understand ? ”
49495	49500	49491	49491	I	75	“ I ’m trying . ”
49501	49527	49528	49528	He	1324	“ You know the way I am . You ’ve seen me at my worst . Last night , you said you want me anyway . ”
49534	49576	49528	49528	He	1324	“ That ’s where I fucked up . I did n’t trust you to make that decision for yourself and I should have . Because I did n’t , I ’ve been too cautious . Your past scares me , Eva . ”
49600	49608	49591	49591	my	75	“ Do n’t give him that power . ”
49609	49656	49528	49528	He	1324	“ I wo n’t . And you have to realize there ’s more than one answer for everything . Who says you need me too much ? Who says it ’s not healthy ? Not you . You ’re unhappy because you ’re holding yourself back . ”
49657	49662	49591	49591	my	75	“ Men do n’t — ”
49663	49724	49528	49528	He	1324	“ Fuck that . Neither of us is typical . And that ’s okay . Turn off that voice in your head that ’s screwing you up . Trust me to know what you need , even when you think I ’m wrong . And I ’ll trust your decision to be with me despite my faults . Got it ? ”
49737	49744	49745	49745	he	75	“ You do n’t look convinced , ”
49749	49780	49745	49745	he	75	“ I ’m afraid I ’ll lose myself in you , Gideon . I ’m scared I ’ll lose the part of me I worked so hard to get back . ”
49781	49789	49790	49790	he	75	“ I ’d never let that happen , ”
49794	49834	49790	49790	he	75	“ What I want is for us both to feel safe . What you and I have together should n’t be draining us like this . It should be the one rock - solid thing we both count on . ”
49844	49849	49850	49850	I	75	“ I want that , ”
49853	49857	49850	49850	I	75	“ So much . ”
49858	49870	49871	49871	Gideon	1324	“ I ’m going to give it to you , angel . ”
49883	49903	49871	49871	Gideon	1324	“ I ’m going to give it to both of us . And you ’re going to let me . ”
49904	49914	49915	49916	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ THINGS seem to be looking better this week , ”
49983	49995	49965	49966	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Is there anything in particular you ’d like to discuss ? ”
49996	50001	50002	50002	I	75	“ Tuesday was tough , ”
50006	50027	49965	49966	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ I imagine so . Let ’s talk about Monday night . Can you tell me what happened , Eva ? ”
50057	50065	50066	50067	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ So you ’re sleeping separately now ? ”
50070	50073	50066	50067	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Yes . ”
50074	50076	50066	50067	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Your nightmares”—he
50080	50087	50066	50067	Dr. Petersen	1648	me—“how often do you have them ? ”
50088	50107	50108	50108	I	75	“ Rarely . Prior to dating Gideon , it ’d been almost two years since my last one . ”
50128	50133	50134	50134	I	75	“ I love him , ”
50164	50179	50154	50154	He	1648	“ I do n’t doubt it . What made you say that , Eva ? ”
50193	50199	50200	50200	Gideon	1324	“ She wants your approval , ”
50212	50217	50218	50219	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Is that true ? ”
50223	50226	50204	50204	His	1324	“ No . ”
50227	50234	50238	50238	Gideon	1324	“ The hell it is n’t . ”
50244	50249	50250	50250	I	75	“ It ’s not , ”
50268	50285	50250	50250	I	75	“ I just … It ’s just the truth . That ’s the way I feel . ”
50292	50308	50309	50309	I	75	“ We have to make this work . We ’re going to make this work , ”
50312	50340	50309	50309	I	75	“ I just want to know that you ’re on the same page . I need to know that you understand that failure is n’t an option . ”
50341	50344	50345	50345	He	1648	“ Eva . ”
50349	50367	50345	50345	He	1648	“ You and Gideon have a lot to work through , but it ’s certainly not insurmountable . ”
50378	50383	50384	50384	I	75	“ I love him , ”
50407	50418	50393	50393	Gideon	1324	“ If you ’ll excuse us a minute , Doctor . ”
50499	50508	50495	50495	I	75	“ Gideon , I swear it ’s not — ”
50509	50512	50513	50513	He	1324	“ Hush . ”
50697	50702	50703	50703	I	75	“ Hey , you , ”
50726	50731	50732	50732	He	1952	“ Hey , stranger . ”
50756	50762	50740	50740	we	767	“ You ’re looking happy . ”
50773	50793	50767	50767	me	75	“ Ugh . It ’s hot as hell . Let ’s pick somewhere close . You up for tacos ? ”
50794	50798	50799	50799	I	75	“ Hell yeah . ”
50897	50903	50904	50904	I	75	“ Got any plans tonight ? ”
50914	50945	50946	50946	He	1324	“ One of the photographers I ’ve worked with is having a birthday bash tonight . I figured I ’d pop in for a bit and see how it goes . ”
50963	50981	50946	50946	He	1324	“ You still planning on hanging with your boss ’s sister ? You guys wanna come with ? ”
50982	50989	50990	50990	I	75	“ Sister - in - law , ”
50993	51048	50990	50990	I	75	“ And she ’s got concert tickets . I ’m her last hope , she said , but even if I was n’t , I think it ’ll be fun . At least I hope so . I ’ve never heard of the band , so I ’m just hoping they do n’t suck . ”
51049	51054	50946	50946	He	1324	“ Who is it ? ”
51055	51063	50990	50990	I	75	“ Six - Ninths . Know ’em ? ”
51068	51084	51064	51064	His	75	“ Six - Ninths ? Really ? They ’re good . You ’ll like them . ”
51104	51122	51085	51085	I	75	“ You ’ve heard of them and Shawna ’s a big fan . Where have I been ? ”
51123	51137	51159	51159	Cary	1952	“ Under Cross and his hard place . You taking him with you ? ”
51138	51141	51142	51142	I	75	“ Yes . ”
51209	51218	51219	51219	Cary	1952	“ Ca n’t see Cross liking alt rock . ”
51229	51246	51219	51219	Cary	1952	“ Does he know how much you like it ? Especially the musicians who play it ? ”
51255	51268	51247	51247	I	75	“ I ca n’t believe you brought that up . Ancient history . ”
51269	51281	51219	51219	Cary	1952	“ So ? Brett was hot . Ever think about him ? ”
51282	51286	51287	51287	I	75	“ With shame . ”
51297	51304	51287	51287	I	75	“ So I try not to . ”
51305	51312	51313	51313	Cary	1952	“ He was a decent guy , ”
51328	51345	51362	51363	Brett Kline	142	“ I ’m not saying he was n’t . He just was n’t good for me . ”
51399	51409	51380	51380	he	142	“ Moving on … You talk to Trey lately ? ”
51415	51419	51410	51410	Cary	1952	“ This morning . ”
51429	51461	51426	51426	he	1952	“ I miss him . Miss talking to him . He ’s so fucking smart , you know ? Like you . He ’s going to that party with me tonight . ”
51462	51471	51410	51410	Cary	1952	“ As friends ? Or as a date ? ”
51472	51478	51479	51479	He	1952	“ These are really good . ”
51491	51561	51479	51479	He	1952	“ We ’re supposed to be going as friends , but you know I ’ll probably screw that up and fuck him . I asked him to meet me there and to head home from there so we ’re not alone , but I can always bang him in the bathroom or a goddamn maintenance closet . I have no willpower and he ca n’t say no to me . ”
51570	51578	51579	51579	I	75	“ I know what that ’s like , ”
51601	51621	51590	51590	I	75	“ Why do n’t you … you know … take care of it beforehand . Maybe that ’ll help . ”
51633	51647	51629	51629	his	1952	“ Can I get you to record that for my voice mail message ? ”
51665	51678	51658	51658	He	1952	“ You can be such a prude sometimes . I love it . ”
51679	51692	51648	51648	I	75	“ I love you . And I want you to be happy . ”
51705	51715	51700	51700	he	1952	“ I ’m working on it , baby girl . ”
51716	51732	51658	51658	He	1952	“ I ’m here if you need me , even if I ’m not home . ”
51733	51737	51738	51738	He	1952	“ I know . ”
51746	51766	51767	51767	I	75	“ I ’ll be around a lot next week . Got ta get ready for my dad ’s visit . ”
51787	51834	51767	51767	I	75	“ I wanted to ask you about Friday . I ’ve got to work , so if you ’re around , would you keep an eye on him ? I ’ll stock up on the food he likes and leave him some city maps , but — ”
51835	51839	51840	51840	Cary	1952	“ No problem . ”
51851	51859	51840	51840	Cary	1952	“ He ’ll be in good hands . ”
51860	51874	51767	51767	I	75	“ Want to see a show with us while he ’s in town ? ”
51875	51907	51840	51840	Cary	1952	“ Eva honey , I ’m always game to hang with you . Just let me know where and when , and I ’ll keep things clear as much as possible . ”
51908	51911	51912	51912	I	75	“ Oh ! ”
51918	51937	51912	51912	I	75	“ Mom told me she saw your pretty mug on the side of a bus the other day . ”
51941	51960	51938	51938	He	1952	“ I know . She forwarded a pic she ’d taken with her phone . Awesome , right ? ”
51961	51970	51971	51971	I	75	“ Beyond . We ’ll need to celebrate , ”
51979	51983	51971	51971	I	75	“ Hell yeah . ”
51984	51987	51988	51988	Shawna	117	“ WHOA ! ”
52008	52014	51988	51988	Shawna	117	“ You went all out . ”
52015	52019	52020	52020	I	75	“ Not me , ”
52211	52222	52223	52223	Shawna	117	“ Holy shit , tell me that ’s for me , ”
52233	52247	52223	52223	Shawna	117	“ Hey , you ’ve got your own . That one ’s mine . ”
52292	52303	52281	52281	She	117	“ All right . I ’ll settle for an introduction . ”
52355	52379	52344	52344	He	1324	“ Make sure I ’m standing behind you when you bend over , angel , or I ’ll be spanking this pretty ass . ”
52391	52397	52384	52384	I	75	“ My period ’s over . ”
52411	52421	52398	52398	He	1324	“ Why did n’t you tell me that earlier ? ”
52422	52428	52429	52429	I	75	“ Delayed gratification , ace , ”
52551	52593	52535	52535	Shawna	117	“ Doug tried to get us in here before he left , but the waiting list is two months long . You can walk up , but the wait can be hours and there ’s no guarantee you ’ll be seated . ”
52656	52662	52652	52654	One of yours	790	“ Yes , in partnership . ”
52672	52683	52663	52663	I	75	“ Is your friend going to meet us for dinner ? ”
52694	52700	52684	52684	Gideon	1324	“ He ’s already here . ”
52760	52765	52766	52766	Shawna	117	“ Oh my God . ”
52772	52794	52766	52766	Shawna	117	“ That ’s Arnoldo Ricci ! He owns this place . And he ’s got a show on the Food Network ! ”
52814	52823	52795	52795	Gideon	1324	“ Arnoldo , my girlfriend , Eva Tramell . ”
52845	52849	52850	52850	Gideon	1324	“ Back off , ”
52868	52875	52876	52876	he	52	“ And who ’s this vision ? ”
52890	52909	52910	52910	Gideon	1324	“ Shawna , this will be your escort , Arnoldo Ricci , if he manages to survive dinner . ”
52918	52924	52910	52910	Gideon	1324	“ Arnoldo , Shawna Ellison . ”
52929	52960	52925	52925	She	117	“ My boyfriend ’s a huge fan of yours . I am , too . He made your lasagna recipe once and it was . To . Die . For . ”
52961	52972	52973	52973	Arnoldo	52	“ Gideon told me your man is in Sicily now . ”

53487	53492	53475	53475	He	52	“ Ready to go ? ”
53493	53498	53499	53499	I	75	“ Oh , yes . ”
53606	53612	53613	53613	Shawna	117	“ THESE guys are good ! ”
53777	53786	53772	53772	I	75	“ Is this band with Vidal , too ? ”
53787	53795	53800	53800	he	1324	“ No . But I like them . ”
53951	53955	53926	53926	He	1324	“ Get a room ”
53957	53963	53926	53926	He	1324	“ Fuck her , man ! ”
54113	54122	54123	54123	he	1324	“ You ’re going to make me come , ”
54488	54495	54496	54496	Gideon	1324	“ Good , are n’t they ? ”

55661	55665	55666	55666	he	1324	“ You okay ? ”
55678	55683	55684	55684	I	75	“ I ’m fine , ”
55729	55737	55738	55738	he	1324	“ I want to go , too , ”
55741	55758	55738	55738	he	1324	“ I ’m dying to get inside you , angel . I can barely think straight . ”
55771	55780	55759	55759	I	75	“ So let ’s get out of here . ”
55781	55788	55789	55789	He	1324	“ I ’ve got backstage access . ”

58505	58512	58499	58499	I	75	“ You have to stop him . ”
58513	58521	58466	58487	the warm , wickedly playful man who ’d enchanted me all evening into the cold , murderous fighter in front of me	888	“ Please , return to the limousine . ”
58522	58525	58526	58526	I	75	“ What ? ”
58543	58548	58538	58539	No one	1675	“ Are you crazy ? ”
58549	58570	58526	58526	I	75	“ We need to take Miss Ellison home . She ’s your guest ; you need to see to her . ”
58608	58620	58601	58601	I	75	“ What ’s the matter with you ? ! Stop them ! ”

58799	58815	58791	58791	I	75	“ He ’s your friend ! You ’re just going to leave him like that ? ”
58816	58822	58827	58827	Arnoldo	52	“ He ’s your boyfriend . ”
58834	58846	58827	58827	Arnoldo	52	“ And you are the one who left him like that . ”
58864	58880	58881	58881	Shawna	117	“ You ’re the Eva in the song ‘ Golden , ’ are n’t you ? ”
58903	58909	58910	58910	He	52	“ I wonder if Gideon — ”
58913	58919	58910	58910	He	52	“ Of course he knows . ”
58920	58928	58929	58929	I	75	“ That was a long time ago ! ”

59178	59184	59163	59163	Arnoldo	52	“ I screwed up everything . ”
59203	59223	59185	59185	She	117	“ No big . I had a great time . I hope you work things out for the best . ”
59318	59323	59324	59324	I	75	“ I ’m sorry , ”
59472	59478	59479	59479	he	52	“ Be gentle with him , ”
59488	59535	59479	59479	he	52	“ I have never seen him the way he is with you . I ca n’t say you are worthy of him , but you can make him happy . I saw that myself . Do it or walk . Do n’t fuck with his head . ”
59586	59599	59579	59579	I	75	“ Where is he ? I need to see him . Please . ”
59600	59604	59605	59605	Angus	104	“ He called . ”

60153	60164	60165	60165	Gideon	1324	“ Is n’t that what happened when he kissed you ? ”
60174	60194	60165	60165	Gideon	1324	“ He ’s had his dick in you . He ’s fucked you … blown his load inside you . ”
60271	60278	60256	60256	He	1324	“ He ’s had your mouth . ”
60394	60402	60377	60377	He	1324	“ What the fuck are you doing ? ”

61082	61092	61062	61062	Gideon	1324	“ It turns you on to suck my cock . ”
61113	61116	61103	61103	he	1324	“ Always . ”
61117	61124	61062	61062	Gideon	1324	“ Why did you kiss him ? ”

61776	61785	61787	61787	he	1324	“ Then shut up and make me come . ”
61809	61813	61801	61801	I	75	“ Fuck you . ”
61814	61822	61787	61787	he	1324	“ Now you ’re getting the idea . ”
61830	61839	61801	61801	I	75	“ Do n’t treat me like a whore . ”
61840	61843	61844	61844	His	1324	“ Eva . ”
61871	61883	61844	61844	His	1324	“ You want to stop , you know what to say . ”
62229	62236	62237	62237	he	1324	“ Tell me why , Eva , ”
62240	62243	62237	62237	he	1324	“ Why ? ”
62244	62250	62251	62251	I	75	“ I do n’t know ! ”
62444	62447	62448	62448	I	75	“ Gideon , ”

62560	62576	62554	62554	he	1324	“ You knew I ’d be coming after you … that I ’d find you … ”

62758	62793	62748	62748	He	1324	“ Tell me why , Eva . Are you thinking of him now ? Are you wishing it were his cock inside you ? Wishing it were his cock fucking your perfect little cunt ? ”
62798	62813	62794	62794	I	75	“ I hate you ! You ’re a sadistic , selfish son of a — ”
62858	62861	62862	62862	Gideon	1324	“ No . ”
62968	62973	62974	62974	I	75	“ I hate you , ”
63000	63007	62994	62994	he	1324	“ Tell me why , Eva . ”
63017	63043	62994	62994	he	1324	“ Because you deserved it ! Because you should know what it feels like ! How bad it hurts , you self - centered asshole ! ”
63081	63084	63085	63085	His	1324	“ Angel . ”
63110	63125	63093	63093	his	1324	“ My stubborn , beautiful angel . Finally , we get to the truth . ”
63437	63448	63432	63432	I	75	“ No more ! I ca n’t take any more . ”
63449	63453	63454	63454	His	1324	“ I know . ”
63476	63485	63454	63454	His	1324	“ I just want to be inside you . ”
63545	63567	63537	63537	he	1324	“ You ’re all I want , Eva . There ’s no one else . There will never be anyone else . ”

63624	63627	63628	63628	Gideon	1324	“ ANGEL . ”
63639	63643	63628	63628	Gideon	1324	“ Wake up . ”
63661	63670	63644	63644	I	75	“ Leave me alone , you sex fiend . ”
63692	63697	63677	63677	He	1324	“ We ’re here . ”
63785	63790	63791	63791	I	75	“ Where are we ? ”
63818	63826	63832	63832	he	1324	“ North Carolina . Lift your arms . ”
63841	63847	63832	63832	he	1324	“ I need my bra , ”
63858	63877	63832	63832	he	1324	“ No one ’s here to see you but me and we ’re going straight into the bathtub . ”
63947	63955	63936	63936	I	75	“ How long have we been driving ? ”
63956	63961	63962	63962	Gideon	1324	“ Almost ten hours . ”
63985	63990	63970	63970	I	75	“ Let ’s go . ”
64055	64061	64032	64032	Angus	104	“ Angus drove all night ? ”
64062	64072	64073	64073	I	75	“ We switched drivers when we stopped for gas . ”
64119	64126	64127	64127	I	75	“ Are you hurt anywhere else ? ”
64158	64161	64142	64142	He	1324	“ Here . ”
64174	64180	64162	64162	My	75	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
64181	64185	64186	64186	He	1324	“ So am I. ”
64266	64274	64275	64275	He	1324	“ We wo n’t be needing that . ”
64288	64303	64275	64275	He	1324	“ For the next two days , we ’re going to be hermits together . ”
64340	64344	64345	64345	he	1324	“ Come on , ”
64354	64363	64345	64345	he	1324	“ We ’ll break into that wine later . ”
64364	64370	64345	64345	he	1324	“ Yeah . Coffee first . ”
64581	64588	64576	64576	I	75	“ Have you been here before ? ”
64600	64612	64589	64589	He	1324	“ No . What reason would I have to come here ? ”
64663	64677	64678	64678	He	1324	“ Take your clothes off , angel . I ’ll start the bath . ”
64718	64727	64728	64728	Gideon	1324	“ I ’m not going anywhere , Eva . ”
64756	64816	64817	64817	I	75	“ If you wanted him , it would n’t be enough for me to let you go . I want you too much . I want you with me , in my life , in my bed . If I can have that , nothing else matters . I ’m not too proud to take what I can get . ”
64855	64858	64859	64859	he	1324	“ Angel , ”
64872	64882	64859	64859	he	1324	“ You ca n’t let me go , either . ”
65003	65009	65010	65010	he	1324	“ Tell me about him , ”
65044	65054	65037	65037	I	75	“ First , tell me if he ’s okay . ”
65063	65077	65060	65060	he	1324	“ There ’s no permanent damage . Would you care if there was ? ”
65078	65085	65086	65086	I	75	“ Of course I ’d care . ”
65092	65101	65102	65102	he	1324	“ I want to know about you two , ”
65106	65109	65060	65060	he	1324	“ No . ”
65110	65113	65060	65060	he	1324	“ Eva … ”
65114	65142	65060	65060	he	1324	“ Do n’t take that tone with me , Gideon . I ’m tired of being an open book for you while you hoard all your secrets . ”
65160	65186	65060	65060	he	1324	“ If all I get of you is your body , I ’ll take it . But I ca n’t give you more in return . ”
65187	65198	65060	65060	he	1324	“ You mean you wo n’t . Let ’s be — ”
65199	65204	65205	65205	I	75	“ I ca n’t . ”
65218	65266	65205	65205	I	75	“ Look what it ’s doing to me ! I hurt you last night . On purpose . Without even realizing it , because the resentment is eating at me even while I ’m convincing myself that I can live with everything you ’re not telling me . ”
65275	65313	65270	65270	he	1324	“ I ’m wide open for you , Eva ! You ’re making it sound like you do n’t know me … that all we have is sex … when you know me better than anyone else . ”
65314	65381	65270	65270	he	1324	“ Let ’s talk about what I do n’t know . Why do you own so much of Vidal Records ? Why do you hate your family home ? Why are you estranged from your parents ? What ’s between you and Dr. Terrence Lucas ? Where ’d you go the other night when I had that nightmare ? What ’s behind your nightmares ? Why — ”
65382	65385	65386	65386	he	937	“ Enough ! ”
65411	65421	65422	65422	I	75	“ You should know you can tell me anything , ”
65426	65430	65431	65431	He	937	“ Can I ? ”
65438	65465	65431	65431	He	937	“ Do n’t you have enough to look past as it is ? How much shit can I pile on you before you run like hell ? ”
65486	65510	65476	65476	I	75	“ Okay , then . We ’ll just be fuck buddies who bitch to a therapist once a week . Good to know . ”
65511	65516	65517	65517	he	937	“ I screwed her , ”
65520	65528	65517	65517	he	937	“ There . Do you feel better ? ”
65548	65553	65544	65544	My	75	“ You screwed Corinne ? ”
65554	65560	65561	65561	His	937	“ No , damn it . ”
65566	65571	65561	65561	His	937	“ Lucas ’s wife . ”
65572	65575	65576	65576	I	75	“ Oh … ”
65590	65596	65597	65597	I	75	“ She ’s a redhead , ”
65601	65615	65561	65561	His	937	“ My attraction to Anne was based entirely on her relationship to Lucas . ”
65621	65643	65616	65616	I	75	“ So things were off between you and Dr. Lucas before you slept with his wife ? Or because of it ? ”
65660	65673	65644	65644	Gideon	1324	“ He alienated me from my family . I returned the favor . ”
65674	65680	65644	65644	Gideon	1324	“ You broke them up ? ”
65681	65686	65687	65687	He	1324	“ I broke her . ”
65691	65790	65687	65687	He	1324	“ She came on to me at a fundraiser . I brushed her off until I learned who she was . I knew it ’d kill Lucas to know I ’d banged her , and the opening was there so I took it . It was just supposed to be that once , but Anne contacted me the next day . Because it would hurt him more to know she could n’t get enough , I let it go on . When she was ready to leave him for me , I sent her back to her husband . ”
65817	65821	65822	65822	he	938	“ Say something ! ”
65825	65833	65687	65687	He	1324	“ Did she think you loved her ? ”
65834	65890	65797	65797	his	938	“ No . Fuck . I ’m an asshole for nailing another man ’s wife , but I did n’t promise her anything . I was screwing Lucas through her — I did n’t expect for her to become collateral damage . I would n’t have let it get that far , if I had . ”
65891	65894	65895	65895	I	75	“ Gideon . ”
65902	65905	65906	65906	He	938	“ What ? ”
65916	65926	65906	65906	He	938	“ Why did you say my name like that ? ”
65927	65957	65797	65797	his	938	“ Because you ’re ridiculously dense for such a smart guy . You were sleeping with her regularly and did n’t expect her to fall in love with you ? ”
65958	65961	65962	65962	His	938	“ Jesus . ”
65970	65975	65962	65962	His	938	“ Not this again . ”
65981	66018	65977	65977	he	938	“ Actually , you know what ? You keep on thinking I ’m God ’s gift to women , angel . It ’s better for me if you believe I ’m the best you can get . ”
66073	66087	66065	66065	Gideon	1324	“ Now , tell me what the fuck you had with Brett Kline . ”
66088	66103	66065	66065	Gideon	1324	“ You did n’t tell me what Dr. Lucas did to piss you off . ”
66104	66110	66065	66065	Gideon	1324	“ Yes , I did . ”
66111	66116	66117	66117	I	75	“ Not the details , ”
66120	66132	66065	66065	Gideon	1324	“ It ’s your turn to spill . Out with it . ”
66183	66194	66195	66195	I	75	“ I was nothing but a convenient fuck for Brett , ”
66208	66244	66195	66195	I	75	“ and I put up with it — went out of my way for it — because in that period of my life , sex was the only way I knew how to feel loved . ”
66245	66256	66195	66195	I	75	“ He wrote a love song about you , Eva . ”
66261	66275	66257	66257	I	75	“ The truth would n’t make much of a ballad , would it ? ”
66276	66282	66195	66195	I	75	“ Did you love him ? ”
66283	66288	66289	66289	I	75	“ I — No . ”
66307	66334	66289	66289	I	75	“ I had a crush on him and the way he sings , but it was totally superficial . I never got to really know him . ”
66341	66354	66335	66335	His	1324	“ He was part of a … phase ? That ’s it ? ”
66404	66408	66409	66409	Gideon	1324	“ Come here . ”
66450	66504	66438	66438	His	1324	“ I wo n’t lie . I want to beat the hell out of any man who ’s had you — you’d be smart to keep them the hell away from me — but nothing in your past can change how I feel about you . And God knows I ’m no saint . ”
66505	66515	66516	66516	I	75	“ I wish I could make it go away , ”
66519	66531	66516	66516	I	75	“ I do n’t like remembering the girl I was then . ”
66543	66572	66532	66532	He	946	“ I get it . It did n’t matter how long I showered after I ’d been with Anne , it was never long enough to feel clean . ”
66667	66679	66650	66650	I	75	“ Why do you get clothes and I get a robe ? ”
66697	66707	66680	66680	He	946	“ Because I ’m the one who arranged everything ? ”
66708	66711	66680	66680	He	946	“ Fiend . ”
66712	66728	66680	66680	He	946	“ Just makes it easier for me to keep up with your insatiable sexual demands . ”
66729	66734	66735	66735	I	75	“ My insatiable demands ? ”
66748	66772	66735	66735	I	75	“ I clearly remember begging to be left alone last night . Or was it this morning , after an all - nighter ? ”
66780	66797	66773	66773	He	946	“ You ’ll be begging again tonight , too . I ’ll go make some coffee . ”
66839	66850	66835	66835	I	75	“ Gideon ! You ’re hurt . Let me see . ”
66851	66856	66857	66857	He	946	“ I ’m fine . ”
66869	66876	66857	66857	He	946	“ Do n’t take too long . ”
67220	67226	67227	67227	he	1324	“ Stop beating yourself up , ”
67275	67286	67262	67262	He	1324	“ It ’s over and done with . Forget it . ”
67304	67310	67311	67311	he	1324	“ It needed to happen , ”
67315	67363	67311	67311	he	1324	“ No . Shut up and listen to me . I thought I understood your feelings about Corinne , and , frankly , I thought you just were n’t dealing with it well . But I had no clue . I was a self - centered idiot . ”
67364	67389	67311	67311	he	1324	“ I ’m not dealing with it well . I hate her fucking guts . I ca n’t think about her without feeling violent . ”
67390	67401	67402	67402	His	1324	“ I get it now . I did n’t before . ”
67407	67431	67402	67402	His	1324	“ Sometimes it takes something drastic to shake me up . Luckily , you ’ve always been very good at getting my attention . ”
67432	67453	67311	67311	he	1324	“ Do n’t try to tease this away , Gideon . You could ’ve been seriously hurt because of me . ”
67467	67487	67454	67454	He	1324	“ I was seriously hurt because of you . Seeing you in another guy ’s arms , kissing him … ”
67495	67519	67454	67454	He	1324	“ It shredded me , Eva . Cut me open and left me bleeding . I kicked his ass in self - defense . ”
67520	67525	67526	67526	I	75	“ Oh , God , ”
67535	67538	67526	67526	I	75	“ Gideon . ”
67539	67563	67564	67564	He	1324	“ I ’m disgusted with myself for not being more understanding about Corinne . If a kiss could make me feel like that … ”
67596	67604	67605	67605	he	1324	“ If you ever cheated on me , ”
67609	67615	67605	67605	he	1324	“ it would kill me . ”
67628	67639	67620	67620	I	75	“ That stupid kiss meant nothing . Less than nothing . ”
67651	67677	67640	67640	His	1324	“ You do n’t understand what your kisses mean to me , Eva . For you to just give one away and call it stupid — ”
68192	68198	68184	68184	His	1324	“ Your kisses are mine . ”
68199	68204	68205	68205	I	75	“ Yes . Gideon … ”
68393	68396	68397	68397	I	75	“ What ? ”
68404	68416	68397	68397	I	75	“ Arnoldo ’s right . It ’s fun watching you eat . ”
68417	68421	68422	68422	His	1324	“ Shut up . ”
68438	68446	68447	68447	I	75	“ How did you find this place ? ”
68451	68459	68447	68447	I	75	“ Or how did Scott find it ? ”
68460	68465	68466	68466	He	1324	“ I found it . ”
68489	68528	68483	68483	I	75	“ I wanted to take you away to an island , where no one could bother us . This is pretty close to that , without the travel time . I planned for us to fly down originally . ”
68611	68624	68625	68625	he	1324	“ You ’re getting that fuck - me look on your face , ”
68628	68637	68625	68625	he	1324	“ And you call me a sex fiend . ”
68638	68641	68594	68594	his	1324	“ Sorry . ”
68642	68646	68625	68625	he	1324	“ Not complaining . ”
68657	68665	68647	68647	I	75	“ Arnoldo does n’t like me anymore . ”
68671	68696	68721	68721	He	1324	“ You ’re getting the fuck - me look and thinking about Arnoldo ? Do I have to kick his ass now , too ? ”
68697	68720	68594	68594	his	1324	“ No . Jeez . I threw that out there to distract us from sex and because it needs to be addressed . ”
68724	68731	68721	68721	He	1324	“ I ’ll talk to him . ”
68732	68746	68721	68721	He	1324	“ I think I should do it , for what it ’s worth . ”
68756	68762	68747	68747	Gideon	1324	“ What would you say ? ”
68763	68807	68721	68721	He	1324	“ That he ’s right . I do n’t deserve you and I fucked up bad . But I ’m crazy in love with you and I ’d like a chance to prove to you both that I can be what you need . ”
68808	68822	68823	68823	He	1324	“ Angel , if I needed you more , I could n’t function . ”
68835	68858	68823	68823	He	1324	“ And I do n’t care what anyone else thinks . We ’ve got our own rhythm and it works for us . ”
68859	68866	68867	68867	I	75	“ Does it work for you ? ”
68883	68903	68867	68867	I	75	“ I know it drains you . Do you ever think it ’s just too hard or too painful ? ”
68904	68915	68974	68974	Jesus	1648	“ You do realize how suggestive that sounds , right ? ”
68916	68921	68922	68922	I	75	“ Oh my God . ”
68925	68930	68922	68922	I	75	“ You ’re terrible . ”
68937	68946	68931	68931	His	1324	“ That ’s not what you usually say . ”
68957	68973	68974	68974	Jesus	1648	“ I ’d rather argue with you , angel , than laugh with anyone else . ”
68993	69002	68974	68974	Jesus	1648	“ You know … I love you madly . ”
69006	69012	69003	69003	He	1324	“ Yes , I know . ”
69033	69046	69023	69023	I	75	“ I need to make my Saturday phone call to my dad . ”
69052	69065	69047	69047	Gideon	1324	“ Not possible . You ’ll have to wait ’ til Monday . ”
69066	69071	69047	69047	Gideon	1324	“ Huh ? Why ? ”
69088	69092	69072	69072	He	1324	“ No phones . ”
69093	69104	69105	69105	I	75	“ Are you serious ? What about your cell phone ? ”
69135	69165	69072	69072	He	1324	“ It ’s heading back to New York with the limo . No Internet , either . I had the modem and phones taken out before we got here . ”
69189	69208	69176	69176	he	1324	“ Wow . When ’s the last time you fell off the face of the earth like this ? ”
69209	69217	69241	69241	He	1324	“ Hmm … that would be never . ”
69218	69240	69176	69176	he	1324	“ There have to be at least a half dozen people freaking out because they ca n’t run something by you . ”
69250	69257	69241	69241	He	1324	“ They ’ll deal with it . ”
69263	69271	69261	69261	me	75	“ I have you all to myself ? ”
69272	69275	69276	69276	His	1324	“ Completely . ”
69284	69294	69276	69276	His	1324	“ What will you do with me , angel ? ”
69302	69312	69295	69295	I	75	“ I ’m sure I ’ll think of something . ”
69359	69368	69369	69369	he	1324	“ I have died and gone to heaven , ”
69383	69406	69369	69369	he	1324	“ where the embodiment of every wet - dream , spank - bank fantasy of my adolescence is real and totally mine . ”
69414	69431	69407	69407	I	75	“ How do you go from devastatingly romantic to crude in the space of an hour ? ”
69432	69442	69443	69443	His	1324	“ It ’s another one of my many talents . ”
69476	69491	69465	69465	He	1324	“ Heaven with my angel . It does n’t get any better than this . ”
69598	69604	69605	69605	he	1324	“ You like it here , ”
69608	69653	69654	69654	He	1324	“ I ’ve always loved being close to the water . My mother ’s second husband had a lake house . I remember walking along the shore like this with her and thinking I ’d buy something on the water for myself one day . ”
69667	69683	69654	69654	He	1324	“ So let ’s do it . How about this place ? You like it ? ”
69701	69707	69684	69684	I	75	“ Is it for sale ? ”
69720	69730	69708	69708	He	1324	“ Everything ’s for sale at the right price . ”
69731	69737	69708	69708	He	1324	“ Do you like it ? ”
69738	69773	69708	69708	He	1324	“ The interior ’s a little cold with all that white , although I like the master bedroom the way it is . We could change all the rest . Make it more us . ”
69774	69777	69778	69778	I	75	“ Us , ”
69816	69825	69799	69799	he	1324	“ Big step , buying a property together . ”
69826	69830	69831	69831	he	1324	“ Inevitable step , ”
69834	69845	69831	69831	he	1324	“ You told Dr. Petersen failure is n’t an option . ”
69846	69852	69853	69853	We	971	“ Yep , I did . ”
69898	69910	69881	69881	I	75	“ So I take it you like it here , too ? ”
69911	69917	69918	69918	He	1324	“ I like the beach . ”
69927	69945	69918	69918	He	1324	“ There ’s a picture of me and my father building a sand castle on a beach . ”
69976	69984	69956	69956	Gideon	1324	“ I ’d like to see it . ”
69985	69991	69992	69992	We	973	“ My mother has it . ”
70002	70010	69992	69992	We	973	“ I ’ll get it for you . ”
70011	70018	70019	70019	He	1324	“ I ’ll go with you . ”
70068	70075	70059	70059	Gideon	1324	“ I can have it couriered . ”
70076	70080	70081	70081	I	75	“ All right . ”
70097	70103	70081	70081	I	75	“ But my offer stands . ”
70104	70113	70114	70114	he	1324	“ What did you think of my mother ? ”
70118	70131	70132	70132	I	75	“ She ’s very beautiful . Very elegant . She seemed gracious . ”
70148	70169	70137	70138	Elizabeth Vidal	233	“ She also seems to love you a lot . It was in her eyes when she looked at you . ”
70176	70184	70170	70170	He	1324	“ She did n’t love me enough . ”
70259	70267	70268	70268	His	1324	“ How much is enough , Gideon ? ”
70280	70287	70272	70272	His	1324	“ She did n’t believe me . ”
70300	70319	70288	70288	I	75	“ You told her what happened to you ? You told her and she did n’t believe you ? ”
70328	70340	70320	70320	His	1324	“ It does n’t matter now . It ’s long done . ”
70341	70352	70353	70353	I	75	“ Bullshit . It matters . It matters a lot . ”
70382	70393	70376	70377	the child	979	“ I bet it hurts like fucking hell , too . ”
70401	70419	70394	70394	His	1324	“ Look at you , so pissed off and upset . I should n’t have said anything . ”
70420	70428	70376	70377	the child	979	“ You should ’ve said something earlier . ”
70441	70449	70436	70436	his	1324	“ I have n’t told you anything . ”
70450	70453	70394	70394	His	1324	“ Gideon — ”
70454	70475	70436	70436	his	1324	“ And of course you believe me , angel . You ’ve had to sleep in a bed with me . ”
70491	70497	70476	70476	I	75	“ I. Believe . You . ”
70517	70520	70508	70508	he	1324	“ Eva . ”
70536	70541	70521	70521	I	75	“ I believe you . ”
70706	70712	70713	70713	I	75	“ Let ’s make s’mores , ”
70728	70735	70713	70713	I	75	“ On that portable patio fireplace . ”
70745	70756	70742	70742	he	1324	“ I want to lick melted chocolate off your body . ”
70765	70771	70761	70761	I	75	“ Would n’t that burn ? ”
70772	70780	70742	70742	he	1324	“ Not if I do it right . ”
70844	70853	70854	70854	I	75	“ Have you talked to Ireland at all ? ”
70901	70904	70888	70888	she	989	“ No . ”
70905	70923	70888	70888	she	989	“ What do you think about bringing her over for dinner when my dad ’s in town ? ”
70936	70955	70924	70924	Gideon	1324	“ You want to invite a seventeen - year - old to dinner with me and your dad . ”
70956	70968	70888	70888	she	989	“ No , I want your family to meet my family . ”
70969	70975	70924	70924	Gideon	1324	“ She ’ll be bored . ”
70976	70982	70983	70983	I	75	“ How would you know ? ”
70986	71017	70983	70983	I	75	“ In any case , I think your sister hero - worships you . As long as you pay attention to her , I ’m sure she ’ll be thrilled . ”
71018	71021	71022	71022	He	75	“ Eva . ”
71028	71045	71022	71022	He	75	“ Be real . I have n’t the slightest idea how to entertain a teenage girl . ”
71046	71057	70983	70983	I	75	“ Ireland ’s not some random kid , she ’s — ”
71058	71065	71066	71066	He	75	“ She might as well be ! ”
71076	71083	71066	71066	He	75	“ You ’re afraid of her . ”
71084	71088	71089	71089	he	75	“ Come on , ”
71092	71100	71102	71102	I	75	“ You are . She scares you . ”
71121	71128	71129	71129	he	75	“ What ’s gotten into you ? ”
71132	71143	71129	71129	he	75	“ You ’re stuck on Ireland . Leave her alone . ”
71144	71156	71158	71158	I	75	“ She ’s the only family you ’ve got , Gideon . ”
71189	71194	71186	71186	her	978	“ I have you ! ”
71195	71198	71199	71199	I	75	“ Baby . ”
71208	71230	71199	71199	I	75	“ Yes , you ’ve got me . But there ’s room for more people who love you in your life . ”
71231	71238	71239	71239	he	992	“ She does n’t love me , ”
71242	71249	71239	71239	he	992	“ She does n’t know me . ”
71250	71278	71199	71199	I	75	“ I think you ’re wrong about that , but if not , she ’d love you if she knew you . So let her know you . ”
71279	71291	71239	71239	he	992	“ Enough . Let ’s go back to talking about s’mores . ”
71327	71336	71337	71337	I	75	“ You wanna talk about s’mores , ace ? ”
71346	71356	71337	71337	I	75	“ All that melty gooey chocolate on our fingers . ”
71375	71402	71362	71362	I	75	“ I could be persuaded to let you smear that chocolate all over me . I could also be persuaded to smear some all over you . ”
71407	71418	71403	71403	His	1324	“ Are you trying to bribe me with sex again ? ”
71419	71425	71426	71426	I	75	“ Did I say that ? ”
71430	71439	71426	71426	I	75	“ I do n’t think I said that . ”
71440	71451	71452	71452	His	1324	“ It was implied . So let ’s be clear . ”
71479	71501	71462	71462	his	1324	“ I ’ll invite Ireland to dinner with your father because it ’ll make you happy and that makes me happy . ”
71502	71506	71507	71507	I	75	“ Thank you , ”
71528	71567	71462	71462	his	1324	“ I ’m going to do whatever the hell I want with melted chocolate and your body because it ’ll please me and that will please you . I say when , I say how . Repeat that . ”
71568	71572	71573	71573	I	75	“ You say — ”
71588	71593	71573	71573	I	75	“ Oh , God . ”
71601	71604	71594	71594	He	1324	“ Finish . ”
71619	71628	71605	71605	My	75	“ You say when . You say how . ”
71629	71649	71594	71594	He	1324	“ There are things you can bargain with , angel , but your body and sex are n’t negotiable . ”
71687	71699	71683	71683	I	75	“ What else can I bargain with ? You have everything . ”
71700	71720	71670	71670	I	75	“ Your time and attention are the two things you can leverage . I ’ll do anything for them . ”
71727	71734	71735	71735	I	75	“ I ’m wet for you , ”
71750	71759	71738	71738	Gideon	1324	“ Because that ’s how I want you . ”
72014	72020	72021	72021	Gideon	1324	“ Eva . Get up . ”
72057	72062	72044	72044	he	1324	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
72063	72068	72069	72069	he	1324	“ It ’s Cary , ”
72073	72080	72069	72069	he	1324	“ He ’s in the hospital . ”
72131	72135	72124	72124	I	75	“ What happened ? ”
72136	72143	72187	72187	she	233	“ He was attacked Friday night . ”
72144	72150	72124	72124	I	75	“ How do you know ? ”
72151	72164	72187	72187	she	233	“ Your mother and Stanton both left messages on my cell phone . ”
72165	72170	72171	72171	I	75	“ My mother … ? ”
72177	72184	72171	72171	I	75	“ Why did n’t she … ? ”
72212	72215	72216	72216	He	1324	“ Eva . ”
72233	72242	72216	72216	He	1324	“ Do n’t worry until we know more . ”
72243	72257	72216	72216	He	1324	“ It ’s been days , Gideon . And I was n’t here . ”
72630	72633	72634	72634	I	75	“ Cary . ”
72645	72650	72634	72634	I	75	“ I ’m here . ”
72661	72664	72651	72651	He	1324	“ Eva . ”
72665	72696	72634	72634	I	75	“ I ’m sorry I took so long . I did n’t have my phone . I had no idea . I would ’ve been here if I ’d known . ”
72697	72705	72706	72706	His	1324	“ S’okay . You ’re here now . ”
72713	72719	72706	72706	His	1324	“ God … everything hurts . ”
72720	72727	72728	72728	Gideon	1324	“ I ’ll get a nurse , ”
72760	72765	72745	72745	I	75	“ Are you thirsty ? ”
72766	72769	72732	72732	his	1324	“ Very . ”
72770	72780	72781	72781	I	75	“ Can I sit you up ? Or no ? ”
72792	72795	72732	72732	his	1324	“ Yeah . ”
72838	72850	72832	72832	He	1324	“ You ’re a sight for sore eyes , baby girl . ”
72851	72857	72858	72858	I	75	“ What the hell happened ? ”
72870	72876	72877	72877	His	1324	“ Fuck if I know . ”
72886	72894	72877	72877	His	1324	“ Got jumped . With a bat . ”
72895	72900	72877	72877	His	1324	“ With a bat ? ”
72917	72922	72877	72877	His	1324	“ Was he insane ? ”
72923	72927	72928	72928	he	1324	“ Of course , ”
72947	72952	72940	72940	I	75	“ I ’m sorry . ”
72953	72964	72965	72965	His	1324	“ No , do n’t . Shit . I ’m — ”
72969	72974	72965	72965	His	1324	“ I ’m exhausted . ”
73027	73039	73040	73040	she	1014	“ You can self - administer every thirty minutes for pain , ”
73044	73075	73040	73040	she	1014	“ Just press this button . It wo n’t dispense a dose if it ’s not time , so you do n’t have to worry about pressing it too often . ”
73076	73082	73083	73083	he	1324	“ Once is too often , ”
73150	73164	73144	73145	The nurse	1014	“ He needs his rest . You should come back during visiting hours . ”
73171	73176	73165	73165	Cary	1952	“ Do n’t go . ”
73177	73184	73185	73185	Gideon	1324	“ She ’s not going anywhere , ”
73192	73204	73185	73185	Gideon	1324	“ I ’ve arranged to have a cot brought in tonight . ”
73239	73246	73247	73247	I	75	“ Cary could use more water , ”
73286	73292	73275	73275	Gideon	1324	“ Tell me what happened . ”
73296	73374	73293	73293	Cary	1952	“ Trey and I went out Friday , but he had to bail early . I walked him out to grab a cab , but it was nuts right in front of the club , so we went around the corner . He ’d just taken off when I got nailed in the back of the head . Took me straight down and whaled on me a few times . Never got a chance to defend myself . ”
73391	73394	73395	73395	he	1952	“ Hey , ”
73398	73412	73395	73395	he	1952	“ Teaches me . Do n’t stick my dick in the wrong chick . ”
73413	73416	73382	73382	Cary	1952	“ What ? ”
73445	73452	73453	73453	he	1952	“ I ’ll look into it , ”
73456	73465	73453	73453	he	1952	“ Step out with me for a minute . ”
73488	73497	73485	73485	I	75	“ God , Gideon . He looks terrible . ”
73498	73505	73506	73506	he	1952	“ He got knocked around good , ”
73510	73531	73506	73506	he	1952	“ He ’s got a skull fracture , a nasty concussion , three cracked ribs , and a broken arm . ”
73543	73554	73506	73506	he	1952	“ I do n’t understand why someone would do this . ”
73567	73609	73555	73555	He	1952	“ The doctor said it ’s possible Cary will be allowed to leave in a day or two , so I ’ll make arrangements for home care . I ’ll also let your work know you wo n’t be coming in . ”
73610	73618	73656	73657	MY mother	233	“ Cary ’s agency needs to know . ”
73619	73626	73555	73555	He	1952	“ I ’ll see to it . ”
73627	73631	73632	73632	I	75	“ Thank you . ”
73637	73645	73632	73632	I	75	“ What would I do without you ? ”
73646	73655	73555	73555	He	1952	“ You ’re never going to find out . ”
73720	73750	73702	73702	she	233	“ Eva . I ca n’t believe you went the entire weekend without your cell phone ! What were you thinking ? What if there had been an emergency ? ”
73751	73757	73702	73702	she	233	“ There was an emergency . ”
73758	73761	73762	73762	She	233	“ Exactly ! ”
73779	73827	73762	73762	She	233	“ No one could get hold of you or Gideon . He left a message saying that he was taking you away for the weekend , but no one knew where you were . I ca n’t believe he was so irresponsible ! What was he thinking ? ”
73828	73832	73833	73833	I	75	“ Thank you , ”
73846	73860	73833	73833	I	75	“ for taking care of Cary . It means a lot to me . ”
73861	73867	73868	73869	My mother	233	“ Well , of course . ”
73876	73892	73868	73869	My mother	233	“ We love him , too , you know . I ’m devastated this happened . ”
73910	73916	73917	73917	I	75	“ Are the police investigating ? ”
73920	73937	73938	73938	She	233	“ Yes , of course , but I do n’t how much good it will do . ”
73947	73992	73938	73938	She	233	“ I love Cary dearly , but he ’s a tramp . I doubt he can recall all the women and men he ’s been with . Remember the charity auction you attended with Gideon ? When I bought you that stunning red dress ? ”
73993	73996	73997	73997	I	75	“ Yes . ”
74014	74063	73938	73938	She	233	“ I ’m certain Cary slept with a blonde he danced with that night — while they were there ! They disappeared and when they came back … Well , I know what a satisfied man looks like . I would be surprised if he knew her name . ”
74075	74090	74067	74067	Cary	1952	“ You think this attack has something to do with someone he slept with ? ”
74107	74141	74091	74092	My mother	233	“ Cary was told to keep his hands off ‘ her’—whoever ‘ her ’ is . The detectives will be coming back later today to try to pull some names out of him . ”
74142	74145	74146	74146	I	75	“ Jesus . ”
74165	74174	74146	74146	I	75	“ They need to talk to Tatiana Cherlin . ”
74175	74180	74091	74092	My mother	233	“ Who ’s that ? ”
74181	74225	74146	74146	I	75	“ Someone Cary ’s been seeing . I think she ’d get a kick out of something like this . Cary ’s boyfriend caught them together and she ate it up with a spoon . She loved being the cause of the drama . ”
74309	74313	74314	74314	I	75	“ Excuse me . ”
74324	74327	74328	74328	he	1324	“ Hey , ”
74339	74346	74328	74328	he	1324	“ How are you holding up ? ”
74347	74355	74356	74356	My	75	“ It ’s awful . And senseless . ”
74360	74379	74356	74356	My	75	“ He did n’t need another disaster in his life . He ’s had more than his share . ”
74380	74393	74328	74328	he	1324	“ So have you , and you ’re suffering along with him . ”
74394	74404	74405	74405	I	75	“ And you ’re doing the same with me . ”
74420	74424	74405	74405	I	75	“ Thank you . ”
74431	74452	74425	74425	He	1324	“ I brought some things for you — a change of clothes , your cell and tablet , bathroom stuff . ”
74495	74502	74516	74516	She	233	“ God . I love you . ”
74503	74506	74507	74508	My mother	233	“ Eva ! ”
74529	74539	74516	74516	She	233	“ Sorry , Mom . Ca n’t help it . ”
74550	74553	74554	74555	my mother	233	“ Gideon , ”
74564	74587	74554	74555	my mother	233	“ you should know better than to take Eva away without any means of calling for help . You do know better . ”
74740	74743	74744	74744	he	1324	“ Hey , ”
74747	74769	74744	74744	he	1324	“ Quit the waterworks every time you see me . Makes me feel like I ’m gon na die or something . ”
74812	74819	74820	74820	I	75	“ I ca n’t help it , ”
74825	74842	74820	74820	I	75	“ It sucks . Someone beat me to it and kicked your ass before I could . ”
74843	74848	74849	74849	His	1324	“ Is that right ? ”
74853	74860	74849	74849	His	1324	“ What ’d I do now ? ”
74861	74874	74820	74820	I	75	“ You did n’t tell me about Brett and Six - Ninths . ”
74875	74879	74883	74883	his	1324	“ Oh yeah … ”
74892	74898	74883	74883	his	1324	“ How ’d he look ? ”
74899	74905	74883	74883	his	1324	“ Good . Really good . ”
74917	74931	74883	74883	his	1324	“ Although right now , he might not look much better than you . ”
74943	74950	74951	74951	Cary	162	“ Cross threw down , huh ? ”
74961	74979	74951	74951	Cary	162	“ Taking on Brett took guts — he ’s a barroom brawler who loves a good fight . ”
74980	74990	74991	74991	I	75	“ And Gideon is a trained mixed martial artist . ”
75001	75017	74991	74991	I	75	“ Why did n’t you tell me Captive Soul had signed with a major label ? ”
75018	75066	74951	74951	Cary	162	“ Because you did n’t need to fall into that hole again . There are girls who can date rock stars ; you ’re not one of them . All that time on the road , all those groupies … You ’d drive yourself and him insane . ”
75073	75103	75067	75067	I	75	“ I ’m in total agreement with you . But I ’m insulted that you ’d think I ’d run back to him just because he made it big . ”
75104	75126	74951	74951	Cary	162	“ That ’s not why . I did n’t want you to hear their first single if it could be helped . ”
75127	75132	75067	75067	I	75	“ ‘ Golden ’ ? ”
75133	75136	75137	75137	He	1324	“ Yeah … ”
75147	75155	75137	75137	He	1324	“ What ’d you think of it ? ”
75156	75169	75067	75067	I	75	“ It ’s better than a song titled ‘ Tapped That . ’ ”
75170	75173	75174	75174	He	1324	“ Ha ! ”
75189	75196	75177	75177	I	75	“ So … you kissed him . ”
75197	75208	75209	75209	I	75	“ That ’s the beginning and end of that story , ”
75213	75222	75209	75209	I	75	“ Have you talked to Trey since Friday ? ”
75223	75252	75255	75255	his	1324	“ No . They ’ve got my phone somewhere . My wallet , too , I ’m guessing . When I came to , I was here , wearing this”—he
75257	75261	75255	75255	his	1324	gown—“freakin ’ thing . ”
75262	75271	75272	75272	I	75	“ I ’ll get your stuff for you . ”
75296	75310	75255	75255	his	1324	“ Gideon ’s making arrangements to get you home with a private nurse . ”
75311	75333	75272	75272	I	75	“ Ooh … that ’s a fantasy of mine . Can you make sure the nurse is hot ? And single ? ”
75356	75376	75342	75342	I	75	“ You ’re obviously feeling better , if you ’re feeling frisky . How did things go with Trey ? ”
75377	75380	75381	75381	He	1324	“ Good . ”
75384	75409	75381	75381	He	1324	“ I ’d worried that the party would n’t be his scene . I forgot that he knew a lot of the people already . ”
75432	75442	75424	75424	Trey	302	“ I ’m glad you had a good time . ”
75443	75455	75410	75410	Cary	162	“ Yeah . He was totally set on not getting laid . ”
75456	75468	75424	75424	Trey	302	“ So you tried … after you said you would n’t . ”
75469	75478	75479	75479	He	1324	“ This is me we ’re talking about . ”
75484	75499	75479	75479	He	1324	“ Hell yeah , I tried . He ’s hot and great in bed — ”
75500	75508	75424	75424	Trey	302	“ — and in love with you . ”
75526	75532	75509	75509	He	1324	“ No one ’s perfect . ”
75541	75553	75533	75533	I	75	“ Cary Taylor . Loving you is n’t a character defect . ”
75554	75571	75572	75572	he	1324	“ Well , it ’s not very smart . I was such an asshole to him , ”
75578	75586	75572	75572	he	1324	“ He could do so much better . ”
75587	75598	75533	75533	I	75	“ That is n’t your decision to make for him . ”
75599	75606	75572	75572	he	1324	“ Someone needs to make it . ”
75607	75619	75533	75533	I	75	“ And you ’re volunteering because you love him , too . ”
75624	75635	75533	75533	I	75	“ Do n’t you think that sounds ass - backwards ? ”
75636	75644	75533	75533	I	75	“ I do n’t love him enough . ”
75668	75712	75533	75533	I	75	“ I ca n’t be faithful like he wants . Just him and me . I like women . Love them , actually . I ’d be cutting off half of who I am . Just thinking about it makes me resent him . ”
75713	75722	75723	75723	I	75	“ You fought too hard to accept yourself , ”
75739	75758	75723	75723	I	75	“ I totally understand and do n’t disagree , but have you tried talking to Trey about it ? ”
75759	75772	75773	75773	He	75	“ Yes , I talked to him about it . He listened . ”
75781	75813	75773	75773	He	75	“ I get it , I do . If he told me he wanted to bang some other guy while seeing me , it ’d bother the fuck out of me . ”
75814	75823	75773	75773	He	75	“ But not if it were a woman ? ”
75824	75834	75835	75835	His	75	“ No . I do n’t know . Shit . ”
75843	75863	75835	75835	His	75	“ Would it make a difference to you if Cross were banging another man ? Or just another woman ? ”
75880	75898	75872	75872	I	75	“ If Gideon ’s dick touched anything but his hand or me , we ’d be over . ”
75903	75908	75899	75899	His	75	“ Well , then . ”
75915	75920	75909	75909	I	75	“ Hi , ace . ”
75921	75924	75925	75925	He	75	“ Angel . ”
75930	75938	75925	75925	He	75	“ How are you feeling this morning ? ”
75945	75958	75939	75939	Cary	1952	“ Like I got hit by a bus … or a bat . ”
75959	75982	76003	76003	Gideon	1324	“ We ’re working on getting you set up at home . It looks like we can make that happen by Wednesday . ”
75983	75989	75990	75990	Cary	1952	“ Big tits , please , ”
75993	76002	75990	75990	Cary	1952	“ Or bulging muscles . Either will do . ”
76011	76016	76008	76008	I	75	“ The private nurse . ”
76017	76020	76003	76003	Gideon	1324	“ Ah . ”
76021	76028	76029	76029	Cary	1952	“ If it ’s a woman , ”
76033	76053	76029	76029	Cary	1952	“ can you get her to wear one of those white nurse dresses with the zipper down the front . ”
76054	76069	76070	76070	Gideon	1324	“ I can only imagine the media frenzy over that sexual - harassment lawsuit , ”
76074	76086	76070	76070	Gideon	1324	“ How about a collection of naughty - nurse porn instead ? ”
76087	76090	76091	76091	Cary	1952	“ Dude . ”
76106	76112	76091	76091	Cary	1952	“ You ’re the man . ”
76118	76121	76113	76113	Gideon	1324	“ Eva . ”
76134	76141	76122	76122	I	75	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
76165	76173	76174	76174	Gideon	1324	“ I talked to Garrity this morning , ”
76184	76192	76174	76174	Gideon	1324	“ So do n’t worry about that . ”
76206	76246	76199	76199	he	73	“ Thank you . I ’ll need to go in tomorrow . I ’m going to see if I can get hold of Trey , Cary ’s boyfriend . Maybe he can stop in while I ’m at work . ”
76247	76259	76260	76260	Gideon	1324	“ Let me know if you need any help with that . ”
76266	76276	76260	76260	Gideon	1324	“ You ’ll want to stay here again tonight ? ”
76277	76290	76199	76199	he	73	“ Yes , if that ’s possible . Until Cary comes home . ”
76305	76329	76291	76291	He	1324	“ All right . I have a lot of work to catch up on . Charge your cell so I can reach you . ”
76359	76373	76351	76351	He	1324	“ I have to get this . I ’ll talk to you later . ”
76390	76398	76399	76400	my mother	233	“ He ’s going to marry you , ”
76410	76419	76399	76400	my mother	233	“ You know that , do n’t you ? ”
76448	76455	76426	76426	I	75	“ What makes you say that ? ”
76480	76493	76456	76457	My mother	233	“ He ’s completely taken you over and assumed control of everything . ”
76494	76501	76456	76457	My mother	233	“ That ’s just his nature . ”
76502	76512	76513	76513	she	233	“ That ’s the nature of all powerful men , ”
76527	76594	76513	76513	she	233	“ And he ’ll indulge you , because he ’s making an investment in you . You ’re an asset to him . You ’re beautiful , well bred and well connected , and independently wealthy . You ’re also in love with him and he ca n’t take his eyes off you . I bet he ca n’t keep his hands off you , either . ”
76595	76600	76601	76601	I	75	“ Mother , please . ”
76625	76629	76630	76630	she	233	“ Eva Lauren , ”
76637	76675	76630	76630	she	233	“ I do n’t care if you listen to me because I ’m your mother and you have to — or because you love him and do n’t want to lose him , but you will listen . ”
76676	76683	76684	76684	I	75	“ Like I have a choice , ”
76687	76694	76695	76695	she	233	“ You ’re an asset now , ”
76698	76711	76695	76695	she	233	“ See that your life choices do n’t make you a liability . ”
76712	76719	76751	76751	She	233	“ Are you talking about Cary ? ”
76725	76747	76751	76751	She	233	“ I ’m talking about the bruise on Gideon ’s jaw ! Tell me that has nothing to do with you . ”
76754	76832	76751	76751	She	233	“ I knew it . Yes , he ’s your lover and you see an intimate side to him that few see , but do n’t ever forget that he ’s also Gideon Cross . You ’ve got everything you need to be the perfect wife for a man of his stature , but you ’re still replaceable , Eva . What he ’s built is not . You jeopardize his empire and he ’ll leave you . ”
76837	76842	76833	76833	My	75	“ Are you done ? ”
76884	76950	76843	76843	She	1049	“ You think I ’m a coldhearted gold digger , but my concern is maternal , believe it or not . I want very desperately for you to be with a man who has the money and wherewithal to guard you with everything he has , so I ’ll know you ’re safe . And I want you to be with a man you love . ”
76951	76957	76859	76859	she	1049	“ I ’ve found him . ”
76958	76999	77000	77000	she	1050	“ And I ca n’t tell you how thrilled I am . I ’m thrilled he ’s young and still open to taking risks , so he ’s more forgiving and understanding of your … quirks . And he knows , ”
77010	77036	77000	77000	she	1050	“ Just be careful . That ’s all I ’m trying to say . Do n’t give him any reason to turn away from you . ”
77037	77048	77083	77083	I	75	“ If he did , that would n’t be love . ”
77062	77078	77049	77049	Her	1050	“ Come now . You ’re my daughter . You ca n’t be that naïve . ”
77079	77082	77054	77054	she	1050	“ Eva ! ”
77185	77191	77192	77192	he	302	“ I just found out , ”
77199	77229	77192	77192	he	302	“ Detectives came by my work this morning and questioned me . I ca n’t believe this happened Friday night and I ’m only just finding out about it . ”
77241	77257	77230	77230	I	75	“ I just found out early this morning myself . I was out of town . ”
77305	77322	77291	77291	Trey	302	“ This would n’t have happened if I ’d taken him with me when I left . ”
77323	77332	77291	77291	Trey	302	“ You ca n’t blame yourself for this . ”
77333	77353	77354	77354	He	302	“ Who else do I blame for the fact that he ’s screwing around with another guy ’s girl ? ”
77362	77395	77354	77354	He	302	“ I ’m the one who ’s not enough for him . He ’s got the drive of a hormonal teenager and I ’m working or in school all the damn time . ”
77429	77436	77437	77437	I	75	“ He ’s bisexual , Trey , ”
77452	77461	77437	77437	I	75	“ That does n’t mean you ’re lacking . ”
77462	77473	77437	77437	I	75	“ I do n’t know how to live with this . ”
77474	77488	77437	77437	I	75	“ Would you consider counseling ? With both of you , I mean . ”
77506	77551	77489	77489	He	1952	“ I do n’t know . I think I have to decide if I can live with him cheating . Could you do it , Eva ? Could you sit at home waiting for your man , knowing he was sticking it somewhere else ? ”
77552	77555	77561	77561	me	75	“ No . ”
77567	77574	77561	77561	me	75	“ No , I could n’t . ”
77575	77635	77561	77561	me	75	“ And I do n’t even know if Cary would agree to counseling . He keeps pushing me away . He wants me , and then he does n’t . He ’s committed , and then he is n’t . I want in , Eva , like he ’s let you in , but he keeps shutting me out . ”
77636	77705	77561	77561	me	75	“ It took me a long time to break through to him . He tried pushing me away with sex , always coming on to me , taunting me . I think you made the right decision keeping it platonic on Friday . Cary puts his value on his looks and sex appeal . You need to show him that it ’s not just his body you want . ”
77713	77730	77706	77706	Trey	302	“ Is that how you two got close ? Because you would n’t sleep with him ? ”
77731	77764	77561	77561	me	75	“ Partly . Mostly it ’s because I ’m a mess . It ’s not as obvious now as it was when we met , but he knows I ’m not perfect . ”
77765	77773	77706	77706	Trey	302	“ Neither am I ! Who is ? ”
77774	77789	77790	77790	I	75	“ He believes you ’re better than he is , that you deserve better . ”
77793	77814	77790	77790	I	75	“ Me … well , I bet part of him thinks I deserve him . That we deserve each other . ”
77815	77819	77820	77820	he	75	“ Crazy fucker , ”
77823	77828	77829	77829	I	75	“ He is that , ”
77832	77866	77829	77829	I	75	“ That ’s why we love him , is n’t it ? Do you want to go in and see him ? Or do you want to go home and think about it ? ”
77867	77876	77877	77877	Trey	302	“ No , I want to see him . ”
77887	77910	77877	77877	Trey	302	“ I do n’t care what put him here . I want to be with him while he ’s going through this . ”
77911	77919	77920	77920	I	75	“ I ’m glad to hear that . ”
78072	78076	78077	78077	he	302	“ Drama queen , ”
78083	78101	78067	78067	Trey	302	“ If you wanted flowers , you should ’ve just asked for them . This is extreme . ”
78102	78108	78109	78109	Cary	1952	“ And ineffective , apparently , ”
78120	78128	78109	78109	Cary	1952	“ I do n’t see any flowers . ”
78129	78135	78136	78136	Trey	302	“ I see a ton . ”
78153	78172	78136	78136	Trey	302	“ Just wanted to see what I was up against , so I could beat out my competition . ”
78202	78222	78193	78193	She	293	“ I ’ll take Eva out to breakfast . We ’ll see you in about an hour or so . ”
78223	78228	78229	78229	I	75	“ Gimme a sec , ”
78237	78249	78229	78229	I	75	“ and I ’ll get out of your hair , guys . ”
78316	78319	78320	78321	my mom	293	“ Ready ? ”
78324	78331	78320	78321	my mom	293	“ As I ’ll ever be . ”
78747	78752	78740	78740	Gideon	1324	“ Hey , stranger . ”
78753	78760	78761	78761	he	1324	“ Where the hell are you ? ”
78772	78781	78761	78761	he	1324	“ I ’m on my way to work . ”
78782	78785	78786	78786	He	1324	“ Why ? ”
78794	78801	78786	78786	He	1324	“ Are you in a cab ? ”
78802	78823	78740	78740	Gideon	1324	“ I ’m walking . Jeez . Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what ? ”
78824	78834	78786	78786	He	1324	“ You should have waited to be picked up . ”
78835	78856	78740	78740	Gideon	1324	“ I did n’t hear from you , and I did n’t want to be late after missing work yesterday . ”
78857	78869	78870	78870	His	1324	“ You could ’ve called me instead of just taking off . ”
78883	78905	78877	78877	I	75	“ The last time I called , you were too busy to give me more than a minute of your time . ”
78906	78923	78870	78870	His	1324	“ I ’ve got things to take care of , Eva . Give me a break . ”
78924	78932	78933	78933	I	75	“ Sure thing . How about now ? ”
78989	78995	78985	78985	Angus	104	“ Miss Tramell , please . ”
79003	79008	78996	78996	I	75	“ Are you alone ? ”
79009	79012	78985	78985	Angus	104	“ Yes . ”
79056	79062	78996	78996	I	75	“ Do you have her ? ”
79063	79068	79069	79069	Angus	104	“ Yes , sir , ”
79077	79088	79089	79089	I	75	“ What the hell crawled up his ass and died ? ”
79100	79110	78996	78996	I	75	“ He ’s got a lot on his mind . ”
79166	79176	79177	79177	he	73	“ I ’m sorry to hear about your roommate , ”
79190	79199	79177	79177	he	73	“ Is he going to be all right ? ”
79200	79212	79213	79213	I	75	“ Eventually . Cary ’s tough ; he ’ll pull through . ”
79233	79244	79213	79213	I	75	“ Thank you . And thanks for yesterday , too . ”
79253	79262	79245	79245	His	73	“ I ’m surprised you ’re here today . ”
79263	79269	79270	79270	I	75	“ I need to work . ”
79300	79309	79270	79270	I	75	“ Catch me up on what I missed . ”
79670	79680	79662	79662	I	75	“ Mark Garrity ’s office , Eva Tramell speaking . ”
79681	79684	79687	79687	Megumi	70	“ Eva . ”
79697	79709	79687	79687	Megumi	70	“ There ’s someone asking for you downstairs — Brett Kline . ”
79749	79756	79746	79746	I	75	“ I ’ll be right down . ”
79844	79851	79826	79826	Brett	142	“ Hey . Look at you . ”
79876	79886	79868	79868	he	142	“ I ’m surprised you ’re still in town . ”
79917	79969	79868	79868	he	142	“ We sold out our Jones Beach show over the weekend , then played the Meadowlands last night . I skipped out on the guys because I wanted to see you before we head south . I searched for you online , found out where you worked , and came up . ”
79978	80000	79970	79972	Good old Google	167	“ I ’m so stoked that everything ’s working out for you now . Do you have time to grab lunch ? ”
80001	80004	80005	80005	His	167	“ Yes . ”
80114	80121	80122	80122	he	1656	“ You two were always inseparable , ”
80125	80139	80122	80122	he	1656	“ Except when he was getting laid . Tell him I said hi . ”
80140	80143	80144	80144	I	75	“ Sure . ”
80206	80209	80210	80210	I	75	“ Jesus , ”
80215	80220	80210	80210	I	75	“ I ’m sorry . ”
80224	80254	80221	80221	He	142	“ Makeup made it disappear on stage . And you ’ve seen me with worse . Besides , I got a couple good hits in , did n’t I ? ”
80268	80272	80265	80265	I	75	“ You did . ”
80273	80276	80277	80277	He	142	“ So … ”
80296	80303	80277	80277	He	142	“ You ’re dating Gideon Cross . ”
80329	80337	80318	80318	I	75	“ We ’ve been seeing each other . ”
80338	80343	80304	80304	I	75	“ Is it serious ? ”
80344	80351	80352	80352	I	75	“ Sometimes it seems that way , ”
80356	80362	80352	80352	I	75	“ Are you seeing anyone ? ”
80363	80367	80304	80304	I	75	“ Not now . ”
80452	80461	80462	80462	I	75	“ Why did you write ‘ Golden ’ ? ”
80505	80523	80498	80498	Brett	142	“ Because I think about you a lot . I ca n’t stop thinking about you actually . ”
80524	80531	80498	80498	Brett	142	“ I do n’t understand why . ”
80532	80555	80498	80498	Brett	142	“ We had it going on for six months , Eva . That ’s the longest I ’ve ever been with someone . ”
80556	80565	80566	80566	I	75	“ But we were n’t with each other , ”
80573	80578	80566	80566	I	75	“ Aside from sexually . ”
80583	80603	80579	80579	His	142	“ I understand what I was to you , but that does n’t mean I did n’t get hurt . ”
80622	80669	80604	80604	I	75	“ I feel like I ’m stoned or something . The way I remember it , we ’d hook up after shows , then you ’d go about your business . And if I was n’t there to put out , you ’d grab someone else . ”
80674	80694	80670	80670	He	142	“ Bullshit . I tried getting you to hang out . I was always asking you to stick around . ”
80769	80802	80832	80832	he	142	“ I had the biggest crush on you , Brett . I wrote your name with little hearts around it like a lovesick teenager . I wanted desperately to be your girlfriend . ”
80803	80809	80810	80810	He	142	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
80818	80826	80810	80810	He	142	“ What the fuck happened , then ? ”
80843	80853	80832	80832	he	142	“ Remember when we went to the pool hall ? ”
80854	80863	80864	80864	He	142	“ Yeah . How could I forget that ? ”
80905	80935	80897	80897	he	142	“ I thought we were getting to the point where we ’d start seeing each other outside the bar , but you ditched me the minute we got inside . ”
80936	80943	80944	80944	I	75	“ I went to the bathroom , ”
80961	81002	80944	80944	I	75	“ and when I came out you and Darrin were at the change machine getting quarters for the tables . Your back was to me so you did n’t see me . I heard you guys talking … and laughing . ”
81027	81065	81021	81021	Brett	142	“ I ca n’t remember exactly what was said , but … Shit , Eva . I was twenty - one years old . The band was just starting to get popular . The chicks were everywhere . ”
81066	81070	81071	81071	I	75	“ I know , ”
81075	81082	81071	81071	I	75	“ I was one of them . ”
81083	81116	81117	81117	He	1098	“ I ’d been with you a few times by then . Bringing you along to the pool hall made a statement to the guys that things were picking up between us . ”
81128	81159	81117	81117	He	1098	“ I did n’t have the balls to own up to how I was feeling about you . I made it about the sex , but that was n’t true . ”
81182	81212	81175	81175	His	1098	“ So I screwed it up with my big mouth . That ’s why you bailed that night . That ’s why you never went anywhere with me again . ”
81213	81220	81221	81221	I	75	“ I was desperate , Brett , ”
81224	81234	81221	81221	I	75	“ but I did n’t want to show it . ”
81277	81316	81269	81269	he	142	“ I blew it back then , but now everyone knows what was going on in my head at the time . ‘ Golden ’ is our biggest single . It ’s what got us signed with Vidal . ”
81325	81370	81322	81322	me	75	“ It ’s a beautiful song , and your voice sounds amazing when you sing it . I ’m really glad you came up and saw me again before you head out . It means a lot to me that we talked through this . ”
81371	81386	81387	81387	He	142	“ What if I do n’t want to just head out and move on ? ”
81399	81428	81387	81387	He	142	“ You ’ve been my muse the last few years , Eva . Because of you , I ’ve written the best material the band ’s ever had . ”
81429	81435	81436	81436	I	75	“ That ’s very flattering , ”
81439	81462	81387	81387	He	142	“ We sizzled together . Still do . I know you feel it . The way you kissed me the other night … ”
81463	81469	81470	81470	My	75	“ That was a mistake . ”
81495	81518	81485	81485	I	75	“ And you need to think about the fact that Gideon controls your label . You do n’t want any friction there . ”
81519	81530	81531	81531	His	75	“ Fuck it . What ’s he going to do ? ”
81538	81546	81531	81531	His	75	“ I want another shot with you . ”
81557	81590	81547	81547	I	75	“ That ’s impossible . Even if I did n’t have a boyfriend , I ’m not the right girl for your lifestyle , Brett . I ’m too high - maintenance . ”
81591	81595	81596	81596	he	75	“ I remember , ”
81600	81607	81596	81596	he	75	“ God , do I remember . ”
81611	81619	81608	81608	I	75	“ That ’s not what I meant . ”
81620	81664	81547	81547	I	75	“ And that ’s not all I want . I can be here for you . Look at me now — the band ’s on the road , but you and I are together . I can make time . I want to . ”
81665	81672	81673	81673	I	75	“ It ’s not that easy . ”
81687	81716	81673	81673	I	75	“ You do n’t know me . You have no idea what it would mean to have a relationship with me , how much work it would take . ”
81717	81721	81722	81722	he	75	“ Try me , ”
81725	81744	81673	81673	I	75	“ I ’m needy and clingy and insanely jealous . I ’d drive you crazy within a week . ”
81745	81757	81758	81758	His	75	“ You ’ve always driven me crazy . I like it . ”
81762	81773	81758	81758	His	75	“ Stop running , Eva . Give me a chance . ”
81782	81790	81774	81774	I	75	“ I ’m in love with Gideon . ”
81803	81810	81798	81798	his	75	“ I do n’t believe you . ”
81811	81821	81822	81822	I	75	“ I ’m sorry . I have to go . ”
81838	81841	81833	81833	He	75	“ Eva — ”
81842	81850	81851	81851	I	75	“ Please do n’t make a scene , ”
81865	81871	81833	81833	He	75	“ You did n’t eat . ”
81872	81882	81833	81833	He	75	“ I ca n’t . I need to leave . ”
81883	81893	81894	81894	He	75	“ Fine . But I ’m not giving up . ”
81898	81909	81894	81894	He	75	“ I make mistakes , but I learn from them . ”
81917	81925	81910	81910	I	75	“ There ’s no chance . None . ”
81937	81941	81926	81926	Brett	142	“ Prove it . ”
81968	81977	81978	81978	I	75	“ How did you know where I was ? ”
82003	82010	82011	82011	I	75	“ This is creepy , Angus , ”
82020	82036	82011	82011	I	75	“ I do n’t disagree , Miss Tramell . I ’m just doing my job . ”
82094	82098	82099	82099	he	142	“ Baby girl , ”
82102	82132	82099	82099	he	142	“ I want to sympathize , I do , but the love triangle thing is just too delicious . The determined rock star and the possessive billionaire . Rawr . ”
82133	82141	82092	82092	Cary	1952	“ Oh God . Hanging up now . ”
82142	82147	82099	82099	he	142	“ See you tonight ? ”
82148	82159	82160	82160	I	75	“ Yes . Please do n’t make me regret it . ”
82273	82281	82282	82283	the girl	1999	“ Hey , we passed our floor , ”
82327	82334	82314	82314	them	1115	“ The buttons are n’t working . ”
82339	82345	82346	82350	one of the other girls	1117	“ Use the emergency phone , ”
82480	82488	82489	82489	he	1324	“ Your behavior today has been appalling , ”
82492	82500	82489	82489	he	1324	“ My behavior ? What about yours ? ”
82520	82529	82489	82489	he	1324	“ I ’m talking to you , Eva . ”
82554	82557	82560	82560	him	1324	“ Really ? ”
82579	82602	82560	82560	him	1324	“ Funny how that does n’t lead to me actually learning anything — like about you going out with Corinne last night . ”
82603	82613	82614	82614	he	1324	“ You should n’t be snooping online about me , ”
82618	82631	82614	82614	he	1324	“ You ’re deliberately trying to find something to get upset about . ”
82632	82641	82642	82642	I	75	“ So your actions are n’t the problem ? ”
82658	82667	82642	82642	I	75	“ Just my finding out about them is ? ”
82672	82681	82668	82668	His	1324	“ You need to trust me , Eva . ”
82682	82705	82668	82668	His	1324	“ You ’re making that impossible ! Why did n’t you tell me that you were going out to dinner with Corinne ? ”
82706	82716	82668	82668	His	1324	“ Because I knew you would n’t like it . ”
82717	82724	82668	82668	His	1324	“ But you did it anyway . ”
82750	82765	82668	82668	His	1324	“ And you went out with Brett Kline knowing I would n’t like it . ”
82766	82785	82740	82740	he	1324	“ What did I tell you ? You ’re setting the precedent for how I handle my exes . ”
82786	82798	82668	82668	His	1324	“ Tit for tat ? What a remarkable show of maturity . ”
82846	82854	82855	82855	I	75	“ You ’re making me hate you , ”
82858	82862	82855	82855	I	75	“ Stop it . ”
82915	82929	82907	82907	My	75	“ I ca n’t be around you right now . Let me go . ”
82960	82996	82957	82957	he	1324	“ Angus will pick you up every morning . Wait for him . And I prefer that you eat lunch at your desk . It ’s best if you ’re not running around right now . ”
82997	83001	82957	82957	he	1324	“ Why not ? ”
83002	83016	82957	82957	he	1324	“ I have a lot of things on my plate at the moment — ”
83017	83023	82957	82957	he	1324	“ Like dinner with Corinne ? ”
83024	83035	83036	83036	he	1324	“ — and I ca n’t be worrying about you , ”
83044	83055	83036	83036	he	1324	“ I do n’t think I ’m asking too much . ”
83060	83071	83072	83072	I	75	“ Gideon , why wo n’t you talk to me ? ”
83107	83121	83098	83098	his	1324	“ Tell me what ’s going on . If there ’s a problem — ”
83122	83140	83141	83141	he	1324	“ The problem is that I do n’t know where the hell you are half the time ! ”
83155	83176	83141	83141	he	1324	“ Your roommate is in the hospital . Your dad is coming to visit . Just … focus on that . ”
83425	83431	83432	83432	he	1324	“ You look like shit , ”
83439	83445	83446	83446	I	75	“ Look who ’s talking , ”
83458	83472	83432	83432	he	1324	“ I got hit with a baseball bat . What ’s your excuse ? ”
83495	83505	83506	83506	I	75	“ And I have n’t heard from Gideon since , ”
83510	83536	83506	83506	I	75	“ Even Brett got in touch with me after lunch . He left an envelope at the security desk with his phone number in it . ”
83549	83557	83558	83558	Cary	1952	“ Are you going to call him ? ”
83561	83571	83572	83572	I	75	“ I do n’t want to think about Brett ! ”
83588	83614	83572	83572	I	75	“ I want to know what ’s wrong with Gideon . He ’s had a total personality transplant in the last thirty - six hours ! ”
83615	83621	83650	83653	a local gay periodical	1134	“ Maybe it ’s this . ”
83655	83662	83663	83663	he	1324	“ Trey brought that over today , ”
83720	83729	83730	83730	he	1324	“ It ’s on their website , too , ”
83734	83768	83730	83730	he	1324	“ I figure someone at the agency gossiped , and it spread and turned into someone ’s political crap . Honestly , I ’m having a hard time imagining Cross giving a shit — ”
83769	83785	83730	83730	he	1324	“ About your sexual orientation ? He does n’t . He ’s not like that . ”
83786	83838	83730	83730	he	1324	“ But his PR people might feel differently . Could be why he wants to keep you under the radar . And if he ’s worried that someone might go after you to get to me , that explains why he wants to keep you tucked away and off the streets . ”
83839	83848	83849	83849	I	75	“ Why would n’t he tell me that ? ”
83855	83931	83849	83849	I	75	“ Why is he being such a prick ? Everything was so wonderful while we were gone . He was wonderful . I thought we ’d turned a corner . I kept thinking he was n’t anything like the man I ’d first met , and now he ’s worse . There ’s this … I do n’t know . He ’s a million miles away from me now . I do n’t understand it . ”
83932	83943	83944	83944	Cary	1952	“ I ’m not the guy to ask , Eva . ”
83951	83960	83944	83944	Cary	1952	“ He ’s the one with the answers . ”
83961	83966	83967	83967	I	75	“ You ’re right . ”
83978	83987	83967	83967	I	75	“ I ’ll be back in a bit . ”
84032	84035	84036	84036	he	1324	“ Cross , ”
84040	84043	84036	84036	he	1324	“ Hi . ”
84056	84060	84036	84036	he	1324	“ Hang on . ”
84083	84089	84090	84090	he	1324	“ Is everything all right ? ”
84093	84096	84097	84097	I	75	“ No . ”
84104	84109	84097	84097	I	75	“ I miss you . ”
84113	84124	84110	84110	He	1324	“ I … I ca n’t talk now , Eva . ”
84125	84148	84149	84149	I	75	“ Why not ? I do n’t understand why you ’re acting so cold to me . Did I do something wrong ? ”
84180	84191	84149	84149	I	75	“ Gideon . Who ’s at your place with you ? ”
84192	84198	84149	84149	I	75	“ I have to go . ”
84199	84208	84149	84149	I	75	“ Tell me who ’s there with you ! ”
84209	84225	84149	84149	I	75	“ Angus will be at the hospital at seven . Get some sleep , angel . ”
84286	84298	84277	84277	Cary	1952	“ You look like your puppy just died , baby girl . ”
84555	84563	84568	84568	I	75	“ Eva . What a pleasant surprise ! ”
84605	84608	84609	84609	I	75	“ Hi , ”
84619	84626	84627	84627	he	74	“ Mind if I join you ? ”
84633	84638	84627	84627	he	74	“ Not at all . ”
84712	84721	84722	84722	he	74	“ There has to be some special reason , ”
84725	84738	84722	84722	he	74	“ for you to be in the hospital long before visiting hours . ”
84739	84745	84746	84746	I	75	“ My roommate ’s here . ”
84758	84772	84773	84773	He	74	“ So Gideon Cross threw his money around and made arrangements for you . ”
84785	84798	84773	84773	He	74	“ And you ’re grateful . But what will it cost you ? ”
84819	84830	84805	84805	Gideon	1324	“ Why do you two dislike each other so much ? ”
84837	84846	84831	84831	His	1324	“ He hurt someone very close to me . ”
84847	84855	84856	84856	I	75	“ Your wife . He told me . ”
84863	84879	84856	84856	I	75	“ But that was n’t the beginning , was it ? That was a result . ”
84880	84894	84895	84895	Lucas	74	“ You know what he did , and you ’re still with him ? ”
84903	84958	84895	84895	Lucas	74	“ He ’s doing the same thing to you . You look exhausted and depressed . That ’s part of the game to him , you know . He ’s an expert at worshipping a woman as if he needs her to breathe . Then suddenly he ca n’t bear the sight of her . ”
85000	85039	84990	84990	His	75	“ You ’ve experienced what I ’m talking about . He ’s going to continue to play with you until you rely on his mood to gauge your own . Then he ’ll get bored and dump you . ”
85040	85046	85047	85047	I	75	“ What happened between you ? ”
85056	85064	85065	85065	he	75	“ Gideon Cross is a narcissistic sociopath , ”
85075	85157	85065	85065	he	75	“ I believe he ’s a misogynist . He uses his money to seduce women , then despises them for being shallow enough to find his wealth attractive . He uses sex to control , and you never know what sort of mood you ’ll find him in . That ’s part of the rush — when you ’re always steeling yourself for the worst , you psych yourself up for a surge of relief when he ’s at his best . ”
85158	85165	85166	85166	I	75	“ You do n’t know him , ”
85176	85183	85166	85166	I	75	“ And neither does your wife . ”
85184	85189	85190	85190	He	75	“ Neither do you . ”
85207	85238	85190	85190	He	75	“ No one does . He ’s a master manipulator and liar . Do n’t underestimate him . He ’s a twisted , dangerous man capable of just about anything . ”
85239	85259	85065	85065	he	75	“ The fact that you wo n’t explain his grudge against you makes me think you ’re at fault . ”
85260	85279	85190	85190	He	75	“ You should n’t make assumptions . There are some things I ’m not at liberty to discuss . ”
85280	85285	85065	85065	he	75	“ That ’s convenient . ”
85289	85345	85286	85286	He	75	“ I ’m not your adversary , Eva , and Cross does n’t need anyone to fight his battles . You do n’t have to believe me . Frankly , I ’m so bitter I would n’t believe me if I were in your place . But you ’re a beautiful , smart young lady . ”
85364	85372	85373	85373	he	75	“ If you take a step back , ”
85376	85418	85373	85373	he	75	“ and look at what he ’s doing to you , how you ’re feeling about yourself since you ’ve been with him , and whether you ’re truly fulfilled by your relationship , you ’ll come to your own conclusions . ”
85432	85444	85422	85422	he	75	“ Ah , my latest patient has just entered the world . ”
85463	85477	85445	85445	He	75	“ You ’ll be the one who gets away . I ’m glad . ”
85541	85547	85528	85528	I	75	“ YOU up for Chinese ? ”
85652	85658	85659	85659	I	75	“ Always up for Chinese , ”
85742	85747	85748	85748	He	1324	“ Hey , you . ”
85774	85779	85765	85765	He	1324	“ You look tired . ”
85796	85806	85780	85780	I	75	“ It ’s been a rough week so far . ”
85849	85865	85846	85846	Steven	116	“ I did n’t know your roommate was gay . Did you tell us that ? ”
85866	85873	85874	85874	I	75	“ He ’s bi , actually . ”
85894	85903	85874	85874	I	75	“ I do n’t think it came up . ”
85904	85910	85911	85911	Mark	73	“ How ’s he feeling ? ”
85918	85928	85937	85937	me	75	“ Better . He might be coming home today . ”
85956	85966	85967	85967	Steven	116	“ Let us know if you need any help , ”
85976	85983	85967	85967	Steven	116	“ We ’re here for you . ”
85984	85995	85996	85996	I	75	“ Thank you . It was n’t a hate crime , ”
85999	86033	85996	85996	I	75	“ I do n’t know where the reporter got that . I used to respect journalists . Now , so few of them do their homework , and fewer still can write objectively . ”
86034	86047	86048	86048	Steven	116	“ I ’m sure it ’s tough living in the media spotlight . ”
86078	86096	86070	86076	a solid man with a kind heart	1324	“ But then you have to kinda expect it when you ’re juggling rock stars and billionaires . ”
86097	86100	86101	86101	Mark	73	“ Steven , ”
86106	86109	86110	86110	My	75	“ Ugh . ”
86114	86119	86110	86110	My	75	“ Shawna told you . ”
86120	86126	86127	86127	Steven	116	“ Of course she did , ”
86130	86163	86127	86127	Steven	116	“ Least she can do after not inviting me along to the concert . But do n’t worry . She ’s not a gossip . She wo n’t be telling anyone else . ”
86196	86216	86217	86217	Steven	116	“ Not that it would be a bad thing for Cross to get a taste of his own medicine , ”
86268	86275	86276	86276	I	75	“ He ’ll get a taste , ”
86279	86290	86276	86276	I	75	“ If I have to cram it down his throat . ”
86306	86312	86299	86299	he	73	“ Get him , girl . ”
86325	86333	86299	86299	he	73	“ Mark Garrity ’s office , Eva — ”
86334	86347	86348	86348	Gideon	1324	“ Why is it so damn difficult for you to follow orders ? ”
86377	86380	86299	86299	he	73	“ Eva ? ”
86381	86391	86392	86392	I	75	“ What do you want from me , Gideon ? ”
86407	86437	86404	86404	he	73	“ Cary will be moved to your apartment this afternoon under the supervision of his doctor and a private nurse . He should be there when you get home . ”
86438	86442	86454	86454	he	73	“ Thank you . ”
86465	86470	86462	86462	I	75	“ Are we done ? ”
86488	86497	86462	86462	I	75	“ Angus will give you a ride home . ”
86505	86512	86498	86498	My	75	“ Good - bye , Gideon . ”
86989	86994	86968	86968	Eva	1648	“ DON’T be afraid . ”
87067	87070	87071	87071	He	1324	“ Angel . ”
87223	87226	87201	87201	His	1324	“ Gideon ! ”
87420	87430	87414	87414	He	1324	“ Eva . I ’ve been starved for you . ”
87507	87511	87512	87512	I	75	“ Oh God ! ”
87818	87824	87825	87825	he	1324	“ For you , Eva , ”
87828	87832	87825	87825	he	1324	“ Every drop . ”
88003	88006	88007	88007	I	75	“ Oh ! ”
88046	88051	88038	88038	he	1324	“ Ah … God . ”
88257	88262	88251	88251	I	75	” he said hoarsely . “
88269	88269	88251	88251	I	75	”
88273	88279	88270	88270	I	75	“ Do n’t mock me . ”
88280	88287	88288	88288	He	1324	“ I need you as much . ”
88300	88314	88288	88288	He	1324	“ I ’m just as obsessed . Why ca n’t you trust me ? ”
88326	88339	88315	88315	I	75	“ I do n’t understand you . You ’re tearing me apart . ”
88395	88401	88387	88387	He	1324	“ Your letter gutted me . ”
88402	88415	88387	88387	He	1324	“ You wo n’t talk to me … you wo n’t listen … ”
88416	88421	88422	88422	He	1324	“ I ca n’t . ”
88439	88450	88422	88422	He	1324	“ I just … It has to be this way . ”
88451	88461	88387	88387	He	1324	“ I ca n’t live like this , Gideon . ”
88462	88484	88422	88422	He	1324	“ I ’m hurting , too , Eva . It ’s killing me , too . Ca n’t you see that ? ”
88485	88488	88489	88489	I	75	“ No . ”
88500	88511	88422	88422	He	1324	“ Then stop overthinking and feel it ! Feel me . ”
88573	88578	88579	88579	he	1324	“ Need your love , ”
88585	88589	88579	88579	he	1324	“ Need you . ”
88690	88696	88697	88697	I	75	“ Do n’t let go , ”
88756	88759	88760	88760	he	1324	“ Hey , ”
88767	88770	88771	88771	I	75	“ Hey . ”
88774	88780	88771	88771	I	75	“ How are you feeling ? ”
88781	88789	88790	88790	He	1324	“ I ’m glad to be home . ”
88799	88804	88790	88790	He	1324	“ Everything all right ? ”
88805	88850	88851	88851	I	75	“ Yeah … I just wanted to check on you before I head to work . I ’ll be home around eight . I ’ll grab dinner on the way back , so expect a text around seven to see what you ’re hungry — ”
88858	88867	88790	88790	He	1324	“ What kind of vitamins does Cross take ? ”
88868	88871	88790	88790	He	1324	“ Huh ? ”
88872	88913	88790	88790	He	1324	“ I ’m never not horny , and even I ca n’t pile - drive all night like that . I kept thinking , ‘ He ’s got to be done now . ’ Then he ’d start up again . ”
88927	88941	88922	88922	He	1324	“ It ’s dark in here , but I know you ’re blushing . ”
88942	88951	88952	88952	I	75	“ You should ’ve put your headphones on , ”
88955	88984	88790	88790	He	1324	“ Do n’t stress about it . It was good to find out my equipment still works . I had n’t had a chubby since before the attack . ”
88985	88992	88993	88993	I	75	“ Eww … Gross , Cary . ”
89001	89017	88993	88993	I	75	“ My dad comes in tonight . Technically tomorrow . His flight lands at five . ”
89018	89024	88790	88790	He	1324	“ You picking him up ? ”
89025	89029	88993	88993	I	75	“ Of course . ”
89034	89054	89030	89030	His	1324	“ You ’re going to kill yourself at this rate . You have n’t gotten any sleep all week . ”
89055	89064	88790	88790	He	1324	“ I ’ll catch up . See ya . ”
89065	89068	89069	89069	he	1324	“ Hey , ”
89074	89086	89069	89069	he	1324	“ Does last night mean you and Cross are okay again ? ”
89096	89125	89087	89087	I	75	“ Something ’s wrong , and he wo n’t talk to me about it . I wrote him a letter basically puking out all my insecurities and neuroses . ”
89126	89138	88790	88790	He	1324	“ Never put stuff like that in writing , baby girl . ”
89139	89181	89087	89087	I	75	“ Yeah , well … all it got me was fucked half to death with no better idea of what the problem is . He said it has to be this way . I do n’t even know what that means . ”
89185	89193	89194	89194	I	75	“ You act like you get it , ”
89197	89205	89194	89194	I	75	“ I think I get the sex . ”
89214	89228	89194	89194	I	75	“ Get - it - out - of - your - system sex ? ”
89229	89234	89235	89235	he	1324	“ It ’s possible , ”
89255	89265	89252	89252	I	75	“ I got ta run . Catch you later . ”
89438	89442	89434	89434	he	1324	“ Miss Tramell . ”
89705	89710	89711	89711	I	75	“ Hi , Scott , ”
89716	89730	89711	89711	I	75	“ Is it possible for me to talk to your boss real quick ? ”
89731	89741	89769	89769	I	75	“ Hold on a minute and I ’ll see . ”
89763	89768	89711	89711	I	75	“ Yes , Eva ? ”
89784	89814	89769	89769	I	75	“ I ’m sorry to bother you . This is probably a stupid question , considering , but … are you coming to dinner tomorrow to meet my father ? ”
89815	89821	89822	89822	he	1324	“ I ’ll be there , ”
89826	89832	89833	89833	I	75	“ Are you bringing Ireland ? ”
89859	89862	89822	89822	he	1324	“ Yes . ”
89863	89866	89769	89769	I	75	“ Okay . ”
89867	89899	89822	89822	he	1324	“ I have a late meeting tonight , so I ’ll have to meet you at Dr. Petersen ’s . Angus will drive you over . I ’ll grab a cab . ”
89900	89904	89905	89905	I	75	“ All right . ”
89945	89952	89938	89938	he	559	“ I ’ll see you then . ”
89995	90002	89972	89973	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ How are you , Eva ? ”
90003	90009	90010	90010	His	1648	“ I ’ve been better . ”
90017	90022	90010	90010	His	1648	“ You look tired . ”
90023	90030	90031	90031	I	75	“ So everyone keeps telling me , ”
90041	90046	90035	90035	He	1648	“ Where ’s Gideon ? ”
90047	90060	90010	90010	His	1648	“ He had a late meeting , so he ’s coming separately . ”
90061	90065	90066	90066	He	1648	“ All right . ”
90072	90098	90066	90066	He	1648	“ This is a nice opportunity for us to talk alone . Is there anything in particular you ’d like to discuss before he arrives ? ”
90132	90207	90127	90127	we	1193	“ I just do n’t get it . I feel like he ’s in trouble , but I ca n’t get him to open up at all . He ’s completely cut me off emotionally . Honestly , I ’m beginning to get whiplash . I ’m also worried that his change in behavior is because of Corinne . Every time we ’ve hit one of these walls , it ’s because of her . ”
90241	90272	90234	90234	I	75	“ It almost seems like she ’s got some kind of hold on him and he ca n’t break free of it , no matter how he feels about me . ”
90284	90301	90273	90274	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Did he tell you that he was n’t going to make his appointment on Tuesday ? ”
90302	90305	90309	90309	me	75	“ No . ”
90312	90319	90309	90309	me	75	“ He did n’t say anything . ”
90320	90343	90273	90274	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ He did n’t tell me , either . I would n’t say that ’s typical behavior for him , would you ? ”
90358	90405	90349	90350	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ At times , one or both of you will backtrack a bit . That ’s to be expected considering the nature of your relationship — you’re not just working on you as a couple , but also as individuals so you can be a couple . ”
90406	90416	90417	90417	I	75	“ I ca n’t deal with this , though . ”
90423	90470	90417	90417	I	75	“ I ca n’t do this yo - yo thing . It ’s driving me insane . The letter I sent him … It was awful . All true , but awful . We ’ve had some really beautiful moments together . He ’s said some — ”
90488	90562	90480	90480	I	75	“ He ’s said some w - wonderful things to me . I do n’t want to lose those memories in a bunch of ugly ones . I keep debating whether I should quit while I ’m ahead , but I ’m hanging in here because I promised him — and myself — that I would n’t run anymore . That I was going to dig my feet in and fight for this . ”
90563	90572	90471	90471	I	75	“ That ’s something you ’re working on ? ”
90573	90632	90480	90480	I	75	“ Yes . Yes , it is . And it ’s not easy . Because some of the things he does … I react in ways I ’ve learned to avoid . For my own sanity ! At some point you have to say you gave it your best shot and it did n’t work out . Right ? ”
90642	90657	90633	90634	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ And if you do n’t , what ’s the worst that could happen ? ”
90658	90664	90471	90471	I	75	“ You ’re asking me ? ”
90665	90673	90633	90634	Dr. Petersen	1648	“ Yes . Worst - case scenario . ”
90674	90677	90678	90678	I	75	“ Well … ”
90686	90737	90678	90678	I	75	“ He keeps drifting away from me , which makes me cling harder and lose all sense of self - worth . And we end up with him going back to life as he knew it and me going back to therapy trying to get my head on straight again . ”
90757	90814	90738	90738	He	1648	“ I ’m afraid that he wo n’t cut me loose when it ’s time and that I wo n’t know better . That I ’ll keep hanging on to the sinking ship and go down with it . I just wish I could trust that he ’d end it , if it comes to that . ”
90815	90824	90738	90738	He	1648	“ Do you think that needs to happen ? ”
90825	90833	90834	90834	I	75	“ I do n’t know . Maybe . ”
90846	90865	90834	90834	I	75	“ But considering it ’s nearly seven and he stood us both up tonight , it seems likely . ”
90941	90944	90945	90945	I	75	“ Thanks , ”
90958	90967	90950	90950	he	1197	“ but I ’ll just grab a cab . ”
90989	91002	91003	91004	the driver	1202	“ Mr. Cross said I ’m to take you to La Guardia , ”
91007	91028	91029	91029	I	75	“ You can tell Mr. Cross that I wo n’t be requiring his transportation services now or in the future . ”
91045	91056	91029	91029	I	75	“ And tell him to go fuck himself , too . ”
91242	91245	91246	91246	I	75	“ Daddy ! ”
91268	91274	91275	91275	He	109	“ There ’s my girl . ”
91291	91299	91275	91275	He	109	“ I ’ve missed you like crazy . ”
91320	91323	91324	91324	He	109	“ Hey . ”
91328	91335	91324	91324	He	109	“ What ’s with the tears ? ”
91371	91380	91381	91381	I	75	“ I missed you like crazy , too , ”
91653	91661	91662	91662	I	75	“ The security here is really tight , ”
91670	91699	91662	91662	I	75	“ It ’s impossible to get past the front desk if you ’re not on the list and a resident ca n’t be reached to vouch for you . ”
91707	91712	91700	91701	My dad	559	“ That ’s good . ”
91713	91727	91662	91662	I	75	“ Yeah . I do n’t think Mom could sleep at night otherwise . ”
91738	91747	91748	91748	I	75	“ Let me show you to your room . ”
91790	91795	91779	91779	he	559	“ Are you tired ? ”
91801	91833	91796	91796	He	559	“ I know you are . And you have to work today , do n’t you ? Why do n’t we nap for a bit before you have to get up ? ”
91854	91858	91842	91842	I	75	“ Sounds good . ”
91859	91867	91868	91868	he	559	“ Wake me when you ’re up , ”
91876	91888	91868	91868	he	559	“ I ’ll make the coffee while you ’re getting ready . ”
91889	91892	91893	91893	My	75	“ Awesome . ”
91958	91969	91951	91951	I	75	“ I ’m so glad you ’re here , Daddy . ”
92208	92211	92212	92213	my dad	559	“ Woo ! ”
92216	92219	92212	92213	my dad	559	“ Spanked . ”
92220	92228	92229	92229	Cary	1952	“ You should be ashamed of yourself , ”
92233	92240	92229	92229	Cary	1952	“ taking advantage of an invalid . ”
92241	92249	92212	92213	my dad	559	“ I ’m crying a river here . ”
92287	92291	92292	92292	I	75	“ Thank you , ”
92295	92305	92292	92292	I	75	“ Thank me with dinner . I ’m starving . ”
92309	92318	92306	92306	I	75	“ I got the goods to make enchiladas . ”
92334	92337	92319	92320	My dad	559	“ Yeah ? ”
92338	92344	92345	92345	I	75	“ When you ’re ready , ”
92349	92358	92345	92345	I	75	“ I ’m going to grab a shower . ”
92423	92427	92428	92429	my dad	559	“ Oh yeah , ”
92444	92459	92460	92460	he	559	“ Hum - de - rum , hum - de - rum , moondance , ”
92543	92550	92551	92551	he	559	“ You got two left feet ? ”
92560	92567	92568	92568	Gideon	1324	“ Eva ’s a wonderful dancer , ”
92637	92655	92656	92656	he	559	“ I had n’t realized she was such a good singer , as well . Gideon Cross , ”
92665	92669	92670	92671	My dad	559	“ Victor Reyes . ”
92677	92684	92670	92671	My dad	559	“ I ’m a bit messy . ”
92685	92691	92670	92671	My dad	559	“ I do n’t mind . ”
92737	92747	92748	92748	I	75	“ I ’m so glad you could make it , ”
92755	92760	92748	92748	I	75	“ You look gorgeous ! ”
92761	92766	92748	92748	I	75	“ So do you ! ”
92849	92854	92837	92837	She	1247	“ Can I help ? ”
92855	92870	92873	92873	her	1247	“ Sure . Just do n’t count calories in your head — it’ll explode . ”
93012	93015	92992	92992	Gideon	1324	“ Eva . ”
93028	93032	93033	93033	I	75	“ Do n’t , ”
93036	93045	93033	93033	I	75	“ I ’d rather we did n’t pretend . ”
93089	93093	93094	93094	he	1324	“ Excuse me , ”
93110	93123	93104	93104	Ireland	27	“ Thank you . I know you made him bring me along . ”
93131	93144	93124	93124	I	75	“ Nobody can make Gideon do anything he does n’t want to . ”
93145	93149	93150	93150	She	1253	“ You could . ”
93167	93221	93150	93150	She	1253	“ You did n’t see him watching you dance with your dad . His eyes got all shiny . I thought he was going to cry . And on the way up here , in the elevator , he tried to play it off , but I could totally tell he was nervous . ”
93243	93254	93255	93255	Ireland	27	“ You ’re mad at him , are n’t you ? ”
93263	93273	93258	93258	I	75	“ Some people are just better off as friends . ”
93274	93282	93258	93258	I	75	“ But you said you love him . ”
93283	93290	93291	93291	I	75	“ That ’s not always enough . ”
93329	93336	93337	93337	he	1324	“ Would you like a beer ? ”
93357	93362	93337	93337	he	1324	“ Want a glass ? ”
93363	93366	93337	93337	he	1324	“ No . ”
93372	93384	93367	93367	He	1324	“ You thirsty ? There ’s soda , water , milk . ”
93385	93393	93394	93394	she	1256	“ How about one of those beers ? ”
93403	93407	93408	93408	he	1324	“ Try again , ”
93682	93689	93690	93690	he	1324	“ Can I help with anything ? ”
93707	93725	93693	93693	I	75	“ Can you see if we can get Cary out here ? He ’s got a wheelchair . ”
93726	93730	93744	93744	Ireland	27	“ All right . ”
93748	93754	93744	93744	Ireland	27	“ What happened to Cary ? ”
93755	93768	93744	93744	Ireland	27	“ I ’ll tell you about it while we set the table . ”
93906	93908	93899	93899	He	1324	“ normal ”
94118	94129	94130	94131	the gal	1268	“ Eva ? NYPD detectives Graves and Michna are here , ”
94184	94190	94191	94191	I	75	“ It ’s the detectives , ”
94194	94200	94191	94191	I	75	“ Maybe they have news . ”
94210	94217	94208	94208	Honed	180	“ I ’ll let them in . ”
94306	94310	94311	94313	the female detective	1276	“ Eva Tramell , ”
94384	94414	94356	94356	She	1276	“ I ’m Detective Shelley Graves of the NYPD . This is my partner , Detective Richard Michna . We ’re sorry to disturb you on a Friday night . ”
94456	94459	94460	94460	I	75	“ Hello , ”
94485	94491	94481	94481	Michna	1700	“ You on the job ? ”
94492	94496	94497	94498	my dad	559	“ In California , ”
94501	94515	94497	94498	my dad	559	“ I ’m visiting Eva , my daughter . What ’s this about ? ”
94516	94531	94532	94532	Graves	181	“ We ’d just like to ask you a few questions , Miss Tramell , ”
94540	94549	94535	94535	She	1281	“ And you , too , Mr. Cross . ”
94550	94563	94564	94564	I	75	“ Does this have something to do with the attack on Cary ? ”
94572	94580	94567	94567	She	1281	“ Why do n’t we sit down . ”
94615	94623	94624	94624	Michna	1700	“ Nice place you ’ve got here , ”
94627	94631	94632	94632	I	75	“ Thank you . ”
94645	94653	94654	94655	the detective	1286	“ How long are you in town ? ”
94660	94666	94624	94624	Michna	1700	“ Just for the weekend . ”
94672	94685	94667	94667	Graves	181	“ You go out to California a lot to see your dad ? ”
94686	94697	94667	94667	Graves	181	“ I just moved from there a couple months ago . ”
94698	94710	94711	94711	she	1286	“ I went to Disneyland once when I was a kid , ”
94714	94733	94711	94711	she	1286	“ That was a while ago , obviously . I ’ve been meaning to get back out there . ”
94746	94758	94759	94759	Michna	1700	“ We just need to ask you a couple of questions , ”
94774	94790	94759	94759	Michna	1700	“ We do n’t want to hold you up any longer than we have to . ”
94800	94819	94791	94791	Graves	181	“ Can you tell us if you ’re familiar with a man named Nathan Barker , Miss Tramell ? ”
94850	94854	94855	94855	Graves	181	“ Miss Tramell ? ”
94867	94874	94875	94875	Cary	1952	“ He ’s her former stepbrother , ”
94878	94884	94875	94875	Cary	1952	“ What ’s this about ? ”
94885	94895	94896	94896	Michna	1700	“ When ’s the last time you saw Barker ? ”
94916	94921	94922	94922	I	75	“ Eight years ago , ”
94926	94937	94922	94922	I	75	“ Did you know he was here in New York ? ”
94947	94953	94954	94955	my dad	559	“ Where ’s this going ? ”
94997	95001	95002	95002	Graves	181	“ Mr. Cross , ”
95005	95010	95002	95002	Graves	181	“ What about you ? ”
95011	95016	94989	94989	Gideon	1324	“ What about me ? ”
95017	95024	95002	95002	Graves	181	“ Do you know Nathan Barker ? ”
95048	95057	95058	95058	he	559	“ You would n’t be asking that question , ”
95061	95071	95058	95058	he	559	“ if you did n’t already know the answer . ”
95111	95120	95121	95122	my father	559	“ Is there a point to these questions ? ”
95186	95200	95178	95178	Graves	181	“ Can you just tell us where you were yesterday , Miss Tramell ? ”
95201	95206	95207	95207	I	75	“ Where I was ? ”
95210	95213	95207	95207	I	75	“ Yesterday ? ”
95214	95220	95221	95222	my dad	559	“ Do n’t answer that , ”
95225	95241	95221	95222	my dad	559	“ This interview is n’t going any further until we know what this is about . ”
95253	95262	95242	95242	Michna	1700	“ Nathan Barker was found dead this morning . ”
95280	95286	95287	95287	he	1700	“ We ’re done here , ”
95291	95313	95287	95287	he	1700	“ If you have any further questions , you can make an appointment for my daughter to come in with counsel . ”
95314	95322	95323	95323	Michna	1700	“ How about you , Mr. Cross ? ”
95330	95341	95323	95323	Michna	1700	“ Would you mind telling us where you were yesterday ? ”
95351	95363	95342	95342	Gideon	1324	“ Why do n’t we talk while I show you out ? ”
95482	95492	95493	95493	Ireland	27	“ Maybe he was buying you an engagement ring , ”
95496	95507	95493	95493	Ireland	27	“ And he does n’t want to blow the surprise . ”
95588	95600	95601	95601	he	559	“ Want to fill me in with what ’s going on ? ”
95604	95617	95620	95620	his	559	“ I have no idea . This is all news to me . ”
95629	95654	95618	95618	He	559	“ What ’s the history with you and Nathan Barker ? You heard his name and looked like you were going to pass out . ”
95666	95702	95655	95655	I	75	“ He was a bully , Dad . That ’s all . He did n’t like that his dad remarried , and he especially did n’t like that his new stepmom already had a kid . ”
95703	95714	95655	95655	I	75	“ Why would Gideon have anything to do with him ? ”
95715	95723	95725	95725	I	75	“ That ’s a really good question . ”
95760	95763	95764	95765	My dad	559	“ Eva ? ”
95781	95786	95764	95765	My dad	559	“ Are you okay ? ”
95787	95800	95801	95801	I	75	“ I - I’m tired . I have n’t been sleeping well . ”
95876	95888	95870	95870	I	75	“ Can you take care of Ireland until Gideon gets back ? ”
95889	95893	95894	95894	He	559	“ Of course . ”
95899	95907	95894	95894	He	559	“ We ’ll talk in the morning . ”
95917	95922	95923	95923	she	1302	“ Are you okay ? ”
95931	95951	95923	95923	she	1302	“ I ’m going to lie down , if you do n’t mind . I know that ’s rude . ”
95952	95959	95923	95923	she	1302	“ No , it ’s okay . ”
95960	95967	95968	95968	I	75	“ Really , I ’m sorry . ”
95976	95996	95968	95968	I	75	“ We ’ll do this again . Maybe a girls ’ day ? Hit the spa or go shopping ? ”
95997	96003	95923	95923	she	1302	“ Sure . Call me ? ”
96004	96008	96009	96009	I	75	“ I will . ”
96266	96277	96252	96252	She	233	“ Eva . My God . You have no idea — ”
96278	96283	96284	96284	I	75	“ Nathan ’s dead . ”
96313	96316	96317	96317	She	233	“ Oh . ”
96346	96360	96334	96334	Her	233	“ Have the police come by already ? They only just left us . ”
96361	96368	96369	96369	I	75	“ They were here last night . ”
96380	96409	96334	96334	Her	233	“ Why did n’t you call us ? We should have been with you . You should ’ve had a lawyer with you , at the very least . ”
96410	96423	96424	96424	I	75	“ It was a real quick visit , Mom . Want some ? ”
96430	96453	96334	96334	Her	233	“ No , thank you . You should n’t drink so much of that stuff . It ’s not good for you . ”
96464	96470	96476	96476	me	75	“ Dear God , Eva , ”
96478	96493	96476	96476	me	75	“ Do you realize how many calories are in half - and - half ? ”
96512	96549	96494	96494	I	75	“ They were here for about thirty minutes and then left . They did n’t get anything out of me beyond Nathan being my former stepbrother and that I have n’t seen him in eight years . ”
96550	96559	96560	96560	She	233	“ Thank God you did n’t say more . ”
96571	96580	96566	96566	I	75	“ Let ’s move to my sitting room . ”
96581	96592	96560	96560	She	233	“ What ? Why ? You never sit in there . ”
96612	96618	96619	96619	I	75	“ But you like it , ”
96642	96648	96649	96650	my mother	293	“ I do like it , ”
96773	96807	96765	96765	her	293	“ You ’ll have to be very careful with the police , Eva . If they want to talk to you again , let Richard know so he can have his lawyers present . ”
96808	96845	96846	96846	I	75	“ Why ? I do n’t understand why I should worry about what I say or do n’t say . I have n’t done anything wrong . I did n’t even know he was in town . ”
96860	96868	96846	96846	I	75	“ What ’s going on , Mom ? ”
96876	96896	96869	96869	She	293	“ Nathan showed up in Richard ’s office last week . He wanted two and a half million dollars . ”
96906	96909	96869	96869	She	293	“ What ? ”
96910	96915	96916	96916	she	293	“ He wanted money , ”
96920	96926	96916	96916	she	293	“ A lot of it . ”
96927	96939	96869	96869	She	293	“ Why the hell would he think he ’d get any ? ”
96940	96950	96951	96951	Her	293	“ He has — had — photos , Eva . ”
96958	96965	96951	96951	Her	293	“ And video . Of you . ”
96966	96971	96972	96972	I	75	“ Oh my God . ”
96991	97002	96972	96972	I	75	“ Oh God , I ’m going to be sick . ”
97170	97175	97176	97177	My mother	233	“ Baby , no ! ”
97203	97214	97198	97198	she	233	“ Shh . It ’s over . He ’s dead . ”
97295	97298	97299	97299	she	233	“ Shh , ”
97307	97324	97299	97299	she	233	“ Shh , baby . I ’ve got you . I ’ll take care of you . ”
97383	97390	97391	97392	my mother	233	“ You should n’t do that , ”
97395	97407	97391	97392	my mother	233	“ Rubbing at your eyes like that will give you wrinkles . ”
97438	97442	97445	97445	her	233	“ Eva Lauren ! ”
97478	97484	97485	97485	She	233	“ Oh , stop it ! ”
97491	97497	97485	97485	She	233	“ It ’s not funny . ”
97511	97516	97518	97518	she	233	“ Eva , really ! ”
97611	97617	97618	97618	I	75	“ Did he arrange it ? ”
97626	97639	97622	97622	Her	233	“ Who ? Richard ? Arrange what ? The money ? Oh … ”
97643	97646	97647	97647	she	233	“ No ! ”
97650	97663	97647	97647	she	233	“ He would n’t . His mind does n’t work that way . ”
97664	97673	97674	97674	I	75	“ Okay . I just had to know . ”
97739	97747	97728	97728	I	75	“ How much do the police know ? ”
97748	97751	97752	97752	Her	233	“ Everything . ”
97761	97774	97752	97752	Her	233	“ The seal on Nathan ’s records was broken when he died . ”
97775	97782	97728	97728	I	75	“ And how did he die ? ”
97783	97789	97752	97752	Her	233	“ They did n’t say . ”
97790	97803	97728	97728	I	75	“ I suppose it ’s not important . We have a motive . ”
97812	97841	97728	97728	I	75	“ It probably does n’t matter that we did n’t personally have the opportunity . Your time is accounted for , is n’t it ? And Stanton ’s ? ”
97842	97850	97861	97861	Gideon	1324	“ Yes . And yours , too ? ”
97851	97854	97728	97728	I	75	“ Yes . ”
97977	97988	97991	97991	her	233	“ Remember that skirt I picked up at Macy ’s ? ”
97993	97998	97991	97991	her	233	“ The green one ? ”
97999	98007	97953	97953	her	233	“ Oh , yes . Very pretty . ”
98008	98039	97991	97991	her	233	“ I have n’t been able to wear it , because I ca n’t think of anything I have to go with it . Can you help me find something ? ”
98040	98043	98044	98044	she	233	“ Eva , ”
98049	98067	98044	98044	she	233	“ You should ’ve established a personal style by now — and it should n’t be sweats ! ”
98068	98081	98082	98082	I	75	“ Help me out , Mom . I ’ll be right back . ”
98097	98103	98082	98082	I	75	“ Do n’t go anywhere . ”
98104	98110	98111	98111	she	233	“ Where would I go ? ”
98167	98172	98173	98173	she	233	“ How ’s this ? ”
98192	98224	98173	98173	she	233	“ I love it ! You rock ! Thank you . But I ’m sure you have to go now , right ? I do n’t want to hold you up . ”
98231	98239	98225	98226	My mom	233	“ I ’m not in a hurry . ”
98240	98278	98173	98173	she	233	“ What about Stanton ? This has got to be weighing on his mind . And it ’s a Saturday — he always reserves his weekends for you . He needs to have the time with you . ”
98355	98365	98366	98366	she	233	“ This is weighing on your mind , too , ”
98369	98386	98366	98366	she	233	“ I want to be here for you , Eva . I want to support you . ”
98413	98418	98419	98419	I	75	“ It ’s okay , ”
98423	98467	98419	98419	I	75	“ I ’ll be okay . And honestly , I ’d feel terrible keeping you away from Stanton after all he ’s done for us . You ’re his reward , his little piece of heaven at the end of an endless workweek . ”
98476	98484	98468	98468	Her	233	“ What a lovely thing to say . ”
98668	98701	98659	98659	I	75	“ Having you here … it ’s what I needed , Mama . Crying and laughing and just sitting with you . Nothing could be more perfect than that . Thank you . ”
98702	98705	98706	98706	She	293	“ Really ? ”
98734	98742	98728	98728	her	293	“ I thought you were going crazy . ”
98749	98790	98743	98743	I	75	“ I think I did for a little bit , but you brought me back . And Stanton is a good man . I ’m grateful for all he ’s done for us . Please tell him I said so . ”
98826	98843	98812	98812	She	293	“ Call me tonight and tomorrow . I want to make sure you ’re doing okay . ”
98844	98848	98849	98849	She	293	“ All right . ”
98853	98897	98849	98849	She	293	“ And let ’s plan on a spa day next week . If the doctor does n’t approve of Cary going , we ’ll have the technicians come here . I think we could all use a little pampering and polish right now . ”
98898	98912	98913	98913	We	1342	“ That ’s a really nice way of saying I look like shit . ”
98974	99007	98970	98970	we	1342	“ But you ’re right — it’ll be good for us and it ’ll make Cary feel a whole lot better , even if he can only get a mani and pedi . ”
99008	99020	99024	99024	her	293	“ I ’ll make the arrangements . I ca n’t wait ! ”
99221	99224	99225	99226	My dad	559	“ Monica . ”
99248	99251	99252	99253	My mom	293	“ Victor . ”
99257	99264	99252	99253	My mom	293	“ What are you doing here ? ”
99271	99276	99252	99253	My mom	293	“ Visiting our daughter . ”
99277	99285	99286	99286	I	75	“ And now Mom has to go , ”
99312	99321	99308	99309	my mother	293	“ I ’ll call you later , Mom . ”
99409	99414	99415	99415	she	293	“ Good - bye , ”
99466	99485	99461	99461	I	75	“ How is it that I did n’t know you two are crazy in love with each other ? ”
99505	99513	99489	99489	his	559	“ Because it does n’t mean anything . ”
99514	99525	99553	99553	I	75	“ I do n’t believe that . Love means everything . ”
99526	99536	99537	99537	He	559	“ It does n’t conquer all like they say . ”
99540	99552	99537	99537	He	559	“ Can you see your mother being a cop ’s wife ? ”
99556	99559	99560	99560	he	559	“ Right , ”
99571	99590	99560	99560	he	559	“ Sometimes love is n’t enough . And if it ’s not enough , what good is it ? ”
99620	99629	99615	99616	My dad	559	“ Are you in love with Gideon Cross ? ”
99630	99636	99606	99606	I	75	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
99637	99645	99615	99616	My dad	559	“ Is he in love with you ? ”
99673	99715	99717	99717	he	559	“ I do n’t know . I know he wants me , and sometimes he needs me . I think he ’d do anything he could for me if I asked , because I ’ve gotten under his skin a bit . ”
99751	99762	99717	99717	he	559	“ You ’ve got a good head on your shoulders . ”
99777	99785	99763	99763	I	75	“ That ’s seriously debatable , Dad . ”
99786	99801	99802	99802	He	559	“ You ’re honest with yourself . That ’s a good trait to have . ”
99817	99844	99802	99802	He	559	“ I used your tablet earlier to check my e - mail . It was on the coffee table . I hope you do n’t mind . ”
99850	99854	99845	99845	I	75	“ Help yourself . ”
99855	99875	99845	99845	I	75	“ I surfed the Internet while I was on there . Wanted to see what popped up about Cross . ”
99882	99889	99876	99876	My	75	“ You do n’t like him . ”
99890	99896	99897	99898	My dad	559	“ I ’m withholding judgment . ”
99943	99979	99980	99980	His	559	“ I had a hard time getting a bead on him last night . I just wanted a little more information . I found some pictures of the two of you together that looked promising . ”
99987	99994	99980	99980	His	559	“ Then I found something else . ”
100004	100019	99995	99995	He	559	“ Can you explain this to me ? Is this another sister of his ? ”
100273	100280	100264	100264	I	75	“ That ’s not his sister . ”
100281	100288	100251	100252	another woman	418	“ I did n’t think so . ”
100294	100314	100289	100289	I	75	“ Could you do me a favor and finish making the coffee ? I have a call to make . ”
100315	100327	100328	100328	He	1648	“ Sure . Then I ’m going to grab a shower . ”
100340	100354	100328	100328	He	1648	“ Let ’s go out and erase this whole morning . Sound good ? ”
100355	100359	100328	100328	He	1648	“ Sounds perfect . ”
100398	100401	100402	100402	he	1324	“ Cross , ”
100416	100425	100402	100402	he	1324	“ I really ca n’t talk right now . ”
100426	100452	100402	100402	he	1324	“ Then just listen . I ’ll time myself . One minute . One goddamn minute of your time . Can you give me that ? ”
100453	100457	100402	100402	he	1324	“ I really — ”
100458	100469	100402	100402	he	1324	“ Did Nathan come to you with photos of me ? ”
100470	100475	100402	100402	he	1324	“ This is n’t — ”
100476	100480	100481	100481	I	75	“ Did he ? ”
100484	100487	100488	100488	he	1324	“ Yes , ”
100492	100499	100402	100402	he	1324	“ Did you look at them ? ”
100508	100511	100512	100512	I	75	“ Yes . ”
100515	100587	100512	100512	I	75	“ Okay . I think you ’re a total asshole for letting me go to Dr. Petersen ’s office when you knew you were n’t coming because you were going out with another woman instead . That ’s just serious douche bag territory , Gideon . And worse , it was a Kingsman event , too , which should ’ve had some sentimental value to you , considering that ’s how — ”
100618	100646	100402	100402	he	1324	“ I think you ’re a coward for not coming right out and saying we ’re over , especially before you started fucking around with someone else . ”
100647	100653	100718	100718	His	1324	“ Eva . Goddamn it . ”
100654	100713	100402	100402	he	1324	“ But I want you to know that even though the way you ’ve handled this is fucking wrong and you ’ve broken my heart into millions of tiny pieces and I ’ve lost all respect for you , I do n’t blame you for how you feel after seeing those pictures of me . I get it . ”
100714	100717	100718	100718	His	1324	“ Stop . ”
100738	100777	100778	100778	I	75	“ I do n’t want you to blame yourself , okay ? After what you and I have been through — not that I know what you ’ve been through because you never told me — but anyway … ”
100805	100823	100792	100792	I	75	“ Do n’t blame yourself . I do n’t . I just want you to know that . ”
100824	100827	100828	100828	he	1324	“ Christ , ”
100831	100837	100828	100828	he	1324	“ Please stop , Eva . ”
100838	100848	100849	100849	My	75	“ I ’m done . I hope you find — ”
100856	100864	100849	100849	My	75	“ Never mind . Good - bye . ”
101208	101212	101203	101206	the old Billy Joel	187	“ Uptown Girl , ”
101274	101282	101256	101256	She	293	“ Do you resent her , Daddy ? ”
101283	101288	101289	101289	He	559	“ I used to . ”
101297	101351	101289	101289	He	559	“ I ’m never going to forgive her for not giving you my last name when you were born . But I ’m not mad about the money thing anymore . I ’d never be able to make her happy in the long run , and she knew herself enough to know that . ”
101362	101364	101368	101368	his	559	“ And really”—he
101378	101471	101368	101368	his	559	moment—“as much as I wish I could give you all the things her husbands can , I ’m just glad you ’re getting them . I ’m not too proud to appreciate that your life is better because of her choices . And I ’m not upset with my lot . I ’ve got a good life that makes me happy and a daughter who makes me so damn proud . I consider myself a rich man because there ’s nothing in this world I want that I do n’t already have . ”
101479	101494	101472	101472	I	75	“ I love you , Daddy . I ’m so happy you ’re here . ”
102182	102188	102189	102189	he	107	“ You like it here , ”
102192	102198	102199	102199	I	75	“ I love it here . ”
102206	102234	102202	102202	Will	187	“ I ’m glad . I was n’t sure at first . You did n’t seem all that enthusiastic , even when you were saying good stuff . ”
102235	102247	102248	102248	I	75	“ My bad . I ’m going through a tough breakup . ”
102255	102283	102248	102248	I	75	“ It ’s hard for me to get excited about anything right now , even things I ’m crazy about . This job being one of them . ”
102284	102292	102293	102293	he	107	“ I ’m sorry about the breakup , ”
102303	102310	102248	102248	I	75	“ Yeah . Me , too . ”
102557	102566	102567	102567	Cary	1952	“ What are you going to have done ? ”
102945	102948	102949	102949	Cary	1952	“ Eva ? ”
102955	102961	102962	102962	I	75	“ I want everything done , ”
102966	103001	102962	102962	I	75	“ I want a new haircut . Something short and flirty and chic . I want my nails painted fire engine red — fingers and toes . I want to be a new Eva . ”
103007	103038	103002	103002	Cary	1952	“ Nails , yes . Hair , maybe . You should n’t make sweeping decisions when you ’re fucked up over a guy . They come back to haunt you . ”
103043	103063	103039	103039	My	75	“ I ’m doing it , Cary Taylor . You can either help or just shut up and watch . ”
103064	103067	103068	103069	My mother	233	“ Eva ! ”
103073	103097	103068	103069	My mother	233	“ You ’re going to look amazing ! I know just the thing to do with your hair . You ’ll love it ! ”
103103	103121	103098	103098	Cary	1952	“ All righty , then , baby girl . Let ’s see what New Eva looks like . ”
103248	103256	103257	103257	Cary	1952	“ Okay , I take it back , ”
103262	103269	103257	103257	Cary	1952	“ Clearly you wear breakups well . ”
103270	103273	103274	103275	my mother	233	“ See ? ”
103280	103293	103274	103275	my mother	233	“ I told you ! Now you look like an urban sophisticate . ”
103294	103302	103303	103303	I	75	“ Is that what you call it ? ”
103465	103470	103471	103471	I	75	“ Go for it , ”
103648	103656	103639	103640	My mother	233	“ Stunning , Cary . Simply stunning . ”
103657	103661	103639	103640	My mother	233	“ Thank you . ”
103672	103686	103665	103665	she	233	“ Almost as beautiful on the outside as you are on the inside . ”
103711	103744	103703	103703	I	75	“ Some of us can see right through you , Cary Taylor . Those gorgeous looks do n’t fool us . We know you ’ve got that big beautiful heart inside you . ”
103745	103749	103750	103751	my mom	293	“ Come on ! ”
103859	103862	103863	103863	He	293	“ Eva ! ”
103874	103879	103863	103863	He	293	“ You look ravishing . ”
103888	103890	103880	103880	I	75	“ ravishing ”
103923	103945	103908	103908	Stanton	78	“ It ’s good to see you back on your feet , young man . You gave us all a scare . ”
103946	103953	103908	103908	Stanton	78	“ Thank you . For everything . ”
103954	103959	103960	103960	Stanton	78	“ No thanks necessary , ”
103967	103970	103960	103960	Stanton	78	“ Ever . ”
104133	104138	104139	104139	Cary	1952	“ Look at them , ”
104153	104160	104143	104143	Stanton	78	“ He ’s crazy about her . ”
104161	104179	104180	104180	He	1952	“ Yes . And she ’s good for him . They give each other what they need . ”
104186	104193	104180	104180	He	1952	“ You thinking about your dad ? ”
104194	104198	104199	104199	I	75	“ A little . ”
104222	104273	104199	104199	I	75	“ I never really thought of myself as romantic . I mean , I like romance and grand gestures and that tipsy feeling you get when you ’re crushing hard on someone . But the whole Prince Charming fantasy and marrying the love of your life was n’t my thing . ”
104274	104306	104180	104180	He	1952	“ You and me , baby girl , we ’re too jaded . We just want mind - blowing sex with someone who knows we ’re fucked up and accepts it . ”
104312	104376	104307	104307	My	75	“ Somewhere along the way , I deluded myself into thinking Gideon and I could have it all . That being in love was all we needed . I guess because I never really thought I ’d ever fall in love like that , and there ’s the whole myth that when you do , you ’re supposed to live happily ever after . ”
104385	104405	104377	104377	Cary	1952	“ I ’m sorry , Eva . I know you ’re hurting . I wish I could fix it . ”
104406	104427	104377	104377	Cary	1952	“ I do n’t know why it never occurred to me to just find someone I can be happy with . ”
104428	104445	104377	104377	Cary	1952	“ Too bad we do n’t want to bang each other . We ’d be perfect . ”
104498	104508	104509	104509	he	1324	“ I ’d like to have the next dance , ”
104571	104577	104567	104567	I	75	“ Are you here alone ? ”
104578	104583	104584	104584	He	1324	“ Does it matter ? ”
104591	104607	104608	104608	he	1324	“ You ’re the one I want to dance with . I ’ve got her , ”
104653	104665	104632	104632	I	75	“ You look fantastic , Eva . I love your hair . ”
104672	104676	104666	104666	I	75	“ Thank you . ”
104677	104680	104681	104681	he	1324	“ Relax , ”
104684	104695	104681	104681	he	1324	“ You ’re so stiff . I wo n’t bite . ”
104696	104714	104666	104666	I	75	“ Sorry . Just want to be sure I do n’t offend whoever you ’re here with . ”
104715	104734	104681	104681	he	1324	“ Just my parents and the manager of a singer who ’d like to sign with Vidal Records . ”
104735	104738	104666	104666	I	75	“ Ah . ”
104802	104809	104810	104810	I	75	“ I have to freshen up , ”
104814	104831	104810	104810	I	75	“ All right . But I insist on buying you a drink when you come back . ”
104971	104974	104975	104975	She	623	“ Eva . ”
104987	105018	104975	104975	She	623	“ Christopher said it was you . I did n’t recognize you at first . You look so different with your hair like that . I think it ’s lovely . ”
105019	105031	104975	104975	She	623	“ Thanks . I need to talk to you . Privately . ”
105032	105035	105036	105036	She	623	“ Oh ? ”
105039	105048	105036	105036	She	623	“ Is something wrong ? Is it Gideon ? ”
105049	105053	105054	105054	I	75	“ Come on . ”
105066	105072	104975	104975	She	623	“ What ’s this about ? ”
105085	105103	105081	105081	I	75	“ Remember when Gideon was a child and he told you he ’d been abused or violated ? ”
105108	105115	105104	105104	Her	623	“ He told you about that ? ”
105116	105139	105140	105140	My	75	“ No . But I ’ve witnessed his nightmares . His horrible , ugly , vicious nightmares where he begs for mercy . ”
105171	105182	105162	105162	she	623	“ It was your job to protect and support him ! ”
105188	105194	105183	105183	Her	623	“ You do n’t know — ”
105195	105208	105209	105209	I	75	“ You ’re not to blame for what happened before you knew . ”
105224	105238	105218	105218	she	623	“ But anything that happened after he told you is entirely your fault . ”
105239	105243	105244	105244	she	623	“ Fuck you , ”
105249	105280	105244	105244	she	623	“ You have no idea what you ’re talking about . How dare you come up to me like this and say these things to me when you ’re clueless ! ”
105281	105311	105218	105218	she	623	“ Yeah , I dare . Your son is seriously damaged by what happened to him , and your refusal to believe him made it a million times worse . ”
105312	105325	105326	105326	Her	623	“ You think I would tolerate the abuse of my own child ? ”
105338	105363	105326	105326	Her	623	“ I had Gideon examined by two separate pediatricians to look for … trauma . I did everything I could be expected to do . ”
105364	105380	105218	105218	she	623	“ Except believe him . Which is what you should ’ve done as his mother . ”
105381	105423	105326	105326	Her	623	“ I ’m Christopher ’s mother , too , and he was there . He swears nothing happened . Who was I supposed to believe when there was no proof ? No one could find anything to support Gideon ’s claims . ”
105424	105439	105218	105218	she	623	“ He should n’t have had to provide proof . He was a child ! ”
105476	105488	105218	105218	she	623	“ You were supposed to take his side no matter what . ”
105489	105520	105218	105218	she	623	“ Gideon was a troubled boy , struggling through therapy over his father ’s death , and desperate for attention . You do n’t know what he was like then . ”
105521	105552	105218	105218	she	623	“ I know what he ’s like now . He ’s broken and hurting and does n’t think he ’s worth loving . And you helped make him that way . ”
105553	105558	105559	105559	She	1464	“ Go to hell . ”
105563	105569	105570	105570	I	75	“ I ’m already there , ”
105575	105582	105570	105570	I	75	“ And so is your son . ”
105975	105982	105983	105983	Mark	73	“ You look good , Eva , ”
105994	106001	105983	105983	Mark	73	“ Are you doing all right ? ”
106002	106012	105983	105983	Mark	73	“ Not really . But I ’ll get there . ”
106024	106065	106066	106066	he	187	“ Steven and I broke up once , about a year and a half into our relationship . We ’d had a rough couple weeks and decided it ’d be easier to let it go . It was fucking awful , ”
106070	106102	106066	106066	he	187	“ I hated every minute of it . Getting up every morning was a monumental feat and he was in the same shape . So anyway … if you need anything … ”
106103	106136	106163	106163	Megumi	70	“ Thank you . The best thing you can do for me right now is keep me busy . I just do n’t want any time to think about anything but work . ”
106137	106143	106163	106163	Megumi	70	“ I can do that . ”
106216	106226	106227	106227	Megumi	70	“ We ’re heading to the Hamptons this weekend , ”
106236	106252	106227	106227	Megumi	70	“ My guy ’s grandparents have a place out there . How cool is that ? ”
106253	106256	106257	106257	I	75	“ Very . ”
106265	106280	106257	106257	I	75	“ I ’m jealous you ’ll be able to get away from the heat . ”
106281	106287	106227	106227	Megumi	70	“ I know , right ? ”
106288	106294	106295	106295	Will	187	“ Better than furniture assembly , ”
106309	106320	106295	106295	Will	187	“ I ca n’t wait ’ til we ’re done . ”
106653	106656	106620	106620	I	75	“ Wait . ”
106920	106926	106905	106905	I	75	“ Turn around , Eva . ”
106980	106986	106987	106987	he	1324	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
106995	107003	106987	106987	he	1324	“ It hurts to look at you . ”
107004	107012	106987	106987	he	1324	“ Gideon . What are you doing ? ”
107138	107141	107142	107142	I	75	“ Why ? ”
107145	107174	107142	107142	I	75	“ What do you want from me ? An orgasm ? You want to fuck me , Gideon ? Is that it ? Blow your load inside me ? ”
107190	107194	107175	107175	His	1324	“ Do n’t . ”
107195	107204	107205	107205	I	75	“ Do n’t call it what it is ? ”
107210	107234	107205	107205	I	75	“ Fine . Just do it . But do n’t put that ring on and act like this is something it ’s not . ”
107235	107248	107255	107255	he	1324	“ I never take it off . I wo n’t . Ever . ”
107306	107309	107310	107310	he	1324	“ Wait , ”
107377	107383	107364	107364	Megumi	70	“ Is everything all right ? ”
107390	107405	107384	107384	I	75	“ I have no fucking clue . That man is a total head trip . ”
107410	107415	107406	107406	Her	70	“ Keep me posted . ”
107416	107424	107425	107425	I	75	“ I should just write a book , ”
107470	107473	107474	107474	I	75	“ Hey , ”
107481	107487	107474	107474	I	75	“ If you get bored — ”
107488	107491	107492	107492	He	1952	“ If ? ”
107495	107518	107474	107474	I	75	“ Remember that folder of information you compiled on Gideon ? Can you make me one of those on Dr. Terrence Lucas ? ”
107519	107528	107474	107474	I	75	“ Okay . Do I know this guy ? ”
107529	107537	107474	107474	I	75	“ No . He ’s a pediatrician . ”
107545	107550	107474	107474	I	75	“ Are you pregnant ? ”
107551	107567	107474	107474	I	75	“ No ! Jeez . And if I were , I ’d need an obstetrician . ”
107568	107580	107474	107474	I	75	“ Whew . All right . Spell his name for me . ”
107603	107617	107618	107618	I	75	“ I wo n’t need to fill out any new - patient paperwork , ”
107623	107631	107618	107618	I	75	“ I just want a quick consult . ”
107666	107699	107656	107656	I	75	“ Hey . I need to ask for an hour in the morning for an appointment . Is it all right if I come in at ten and stay ’ til six ? ”
107700	107709	107710	107710	He	1952	“ Ten to five is fine , Eva . ”
107716	107720	107710	107710	He	1952	“ Everything okay ? ”
107721	107727	107656	107656	I	75	“ Getting better every day . ”
107728	107731	107732	107732	He	1952	“ Good . ”
107735	107744	107732	107732	He	1952	“ I ’m really glad to hear that . ”
108195	108234	108189	108189	she	293	“ That day we went out to lunch with Megumi , you freaked out on the walk back to the Crossfire . You saw him , did n’t you ? Nathan . You saw Nathan at the Crossfire . ”
108235	108238	108239	108239	she	293	“ Yes , ”
108242	108285	108239	108239	she	293	“ That ’s why Richard decided it would be best to just pay him what he wanted . Nathan said he ’d stay away from you as long as he had the money to leave the country . Why do you ask ? ”
108286	108308	108309	108309	I	75	“ It did n’t hit me until just now that Nathan was the reason why you reacted the way you did . ”
108331	108345	108326	108326	my	75	“ I have to go , Mom . I ’ll call you later . ”
108346	108352	108353	108353	she	44	“ Is everything all right ? ”
108357	108368	108326	108326	my	75	“ Not yet , but I ’m working on it . ”
108369	108381	108326	108326	my	75	“ I ’m here for you , if you need me . ”
108385	108397	108382	108382	I	75	“ I know . I ’m okay . I love you . ”
108424	108427	108428	108428	he	1952	“ Hey , ”
108448	108453	108438	108438	I	75	“ You know what ? ”
108472	108475	108454	108454	He	1952	“ What ? ”
108476	108518	108454	108454	He	1952	“ I thought Gideon took a hike because of Nathan . Everything was fine and then it was n’t , and shortly after that the police were telling us about Nathan . I figured one thing was linked to the other . ”
108519	108523	108524	108524	He	1952	“ Makes sense . ”
108527	108531	108524	108524	He	1952	“ I guess . ”
108532	108583	108454	108454	He	1952	“ But Nathan was at the Crossfire the Monday before you were attacked . I know he was there to see Gideon . I know it . Nathan would n’t go there to see me . Not a place like that with all the security and people I know around . ”
108588	108597	108584	108584	He	1952	“ Okay . So what does that mean ? ”
108598	108607	108608	108608	I	75	“ It means Gideon was fine after Nathan . ”
108614	108661	108608	108608	I	75	“ He was fine that whole week . He was more than fine that weekend we took off together . He was fine Monday morning after we got back . Then — bam — he lost his fucking mind and went crazy on me Monday night . ”
108662	108667	108584	108584	He	1952	“ I ’m following . ”
108668	108675	108608	108608	I	75	“ So what happened on Monday ? ”
108681	108687	108676	108676	Cary	1952	“ You ’re asking me ? ”
108688	108691	108692	108692	I	75	“ Grr . ”
108700	108720	108692	108692	I	75	“ I ’m asking the fucking universe . God . Anyone . What the hell happened to my boyfriend ? ”
108721	108732	108676	108676	Cary	1952	“ I thought we agreed you need to ask him . ”
108733	108753	108754	108754	I	75	“ I get two answers from him : Trust me and wait . He gave my ring back today . ”
108760	108835	108754	108754	I	75	“ And he ’s still wearing the one I gave him . Do you have any idea how confusing that is ? They ’re not just rings , they ’re promises . They ’re symbols of ownership and commitment . Why would he still wear his ? Why is it so important to him that I wear mine ? Does he seriously expect me to wait while he screws Corinne out of his system ? ”
108836	108848	108754	108754	I	75	“ Is that what you think he ’s doing ? Really ? ”
108860	108877	108853	108853	I	75	“ No . And I ca n’t decide if that makes me naïve or willfully delusional . ”
108878	108891	108754	108754	I	75	“ Does this Dr. Lucas guy have anything to do with this ? ”
108892	108895	108896	108896	I	75	“ No . ”
108905	108911	108896	108896	I	75	“ Did you find anything ? ”
108912	108931	108754	108754	I	75	“ Kind of hard , baby girl , when I do n’t know what I ’m looking for . ”
108932	108939	108940	108940	I	75	“ It ’s just a hunch . ”
108946	108951	108940	108940	I	75	“ What ’s that ? ”
108952	108970	108754	108754	I	75	“ A transcript of an interview with Brett that was done yesterday on a Florida radio station . ”
108971	108981	108940	108940	I	75	“ Oh ? What are you reading that for ? ”
108982	109004	108754	108754	I	75	“ I was listening to ‘ Golden ’ and decided to run a search on it , and this came up . ”
109015	109021	109005	109005	I	75	“ What ’s it say ? ”
109022	109059	108940	108940	I	75	“ He was asked if there ’s really an Eva out there and he said yes , there is , and he recently reconnected with her and hopes to make it work out a second time . ”
109060	109066	109005	109005	I	75	“ What ? No way ! ”
109067	109071	109072	109072	Cary	1952	“ Yes way . ”
109075	109094	109072	109072	Cary	1952	“ So you ’ve got your rebound man lined up if Cross does n’t get his shit together . ”
109101	109111	109095	109095	I	75	“ Whatever . I ’m hungry . Want something ? ”
109112	109125	109143	109143	I	75	“ If your appetite ’s back , that ’s a good sign . ”
109126	109132	109133	109133	I	75	“ Everything ’s coming back , ”
109137	109142	109133	109133	I	75	“ With a vengeance . ”
109175	109181	109182	109182	I	75	“ Good morning , Angus , ”
109186	109193	109194	109194	His	1952	“ Good morning , Miss Tramell . ”
109223	109232	109208	109208	he	1952	“ Do you know where Corinne Giroux lives ? ”
109238	109241	109233	109233	He	1952	“ Yes . ”
109246	109255	109242	109242	I	75	“ That ’s where I want to go . ”
109374	109377	109378	109378	she	795	“ Eva , ”
109382	109387	109378	109378	she	795	“ What a surprise . ”
109388	109407	109367	109367	She	795	“ I ’m sorry to barge in uninvited . I just need to ask you something real quick . ”
109408	109411	109412	109412	She	795	“ Oh ? ”
109424	109430	109431	109431	I	75	“ Can I come in ? ”
109435	109438	109439	109439	She	795	“ Uh . ”
109445	109454	109439	109439	She	795	“ It ’s best if you did n’t . ”
109455	109477	109439	109439	She	795	“ It does n’t bother me if you have company and I promise , this wo n’t take but a minute . ”
109478	109481	109482	109482	She	795	“ Eva . ”
109487	109495	109482	109482	She	795	“ How do I say this … ? ”
109565	109572	109560	109560	him	1324	“ Cut the shit , Corinne . ”
109582	109598	109577	109577	My	75	“ Gideon ’s in love with me . He ’s not fucking around with you . ”
109603	109630	109599	109599	She	795	“ He ’s not fucking around with you , either . I would know , since he ’s spending all of his free time with me . ”
109642	109700	109633	109633	We	1523	“ I know him . I do n’t always understand him , but that ’s a different story . I know he would ’ve told you upfront that you and he were n’t going anywhere , because he would n’t want to lead you on . He hurt you before ; he wo n’t do it again . ”
109701	109715	109599	109599	She	795	“ This is all very fascinating . Does he know you ’re here ? ”
109716	109756	109633	109633	We	1523	“ No , but you ’ll tell him . And that ’s fine . I just want to know what you were doing at the Crossfire that day you came out looking as freshly fucked as you do now . ”
109763	109772	109757	109757	Her	1525	“ What do you think I was doing ? ”
109773	109777	109778	109778	I	75	“ Not Gideon , ”
109800	109866	109793	109798	a total idiot out of myself	1526	“ You saw me , did n’t you ? From the lobby , you had a direct view across the street and you saw me coming . Gideon told you at the Waldorf dinner that I was the jealous type . Did you have a nooner with someone from one of the other offices ? Or did you muss yourself up before you stepped outside ? ”
109889	109897	109898	109898	she	1527	“ Both of those suggestions are absurd , ”
109913	109955	109901	109901	I	75	“ Listen . You ’re never going to have him the way you want . And I know how that hurts . I ’ve been living it the past two weeks . I ’m sorry for you , I really am . ”
109956	109963	109964	109964	she	1527	“ Fuck you and your pity , ”
109967	109983	109964	109964	she	1527	“ Save it for yourself . I ’m the one he ’s spending time with . ”
109984	110012	110013	110013	I	75	“ And there ’s your saving grace , Corinne . If you ’re paying attention , you know he ’s hurting right now . Be his friend . ”
110025	110031	110013	110013	I	75	“ Have a nice day . ”
110076	110085	110061	110061	He	74	“ Gideon will be very angry , Eva . ”
110093	110104	110086	110086	I	75	“ I ’ll deal with it when the time comes . ”
110220	110223	110224	110224	He	74	“ Eva . ”
110234	110244	110224	110224	He	74	“ You did n’t have to make an appointment . ”
110250	110261	110245	110245	I	75	“ I did n’t know how else to reach you . ”
110262	110267	110224	110224	He	74	“ Have a seat . ”
110311	110319	110320	110320	he	74	“ What can I do for you ? ”
110359	110372	110373	110373	His	74	“ Gideon Cross was a patient of yours , was n’t he ? ”
110381	110392	110378	110378	he	74	“ I ’m not at liberty to discuss my patients . ”
110393	110423	110424	110424	My	75	“ When you gave me that ‘ not at liberty to discuss ’ line at the hospital , I did n’t put it together , and I should have . ”
110431	110440	110424	110424	My	75	“ You lied to his mother . Why ? ”
110457	110464	110441	110441	He	74	“ Did he tell you that ? ”
110465	110491	110441	110441	He	74	“ No . I ’m figuring this out as I go . Hypothetically speaking , why would you lie about the results of an exam ? ”
110492	110502	110441	110441	He	74	“ I would n’t . You need to leave . ”
110503	110509	110510	110510	I	75	“ Oh , come on . ”
110518	110544	110510	110510	I	75	“ I expect more from you . Where are the assertions that Gideon is a soulless monster bent on corrupting the women of the world ? ”
110545	110556	110557	110557	His	74	“ I ’ve done my due diligence and warned you . ”
110577	110596	110569	110569	He	74	“ If you continue to throw your life away , there ’s nothing I can do about it . ”
110597	110623	110510	110510	I	75	“ I ’m going to figure it out . I just needed to see your face . I had to know if I was right . ”
110624	110637	110569	110569	He	74	“ You ’re not . Cross was never a patient of mine . ”
110638	110679	110680	110680	My	75	“ Semantics — his mother consulted you . And while you go about your days seething over the fact that your wife fell in love with him , think about what you did to a small child who needed help . ”
110721	110755	110714	110714	I	75	“ What happened between him and your wife happened between two consenting adults . What happened to him as a child was a crime and how you contributed to that is a travesty . ”
110756	110760	110714	110714	I	75	“ Get out . ”
110761	110765	110766	110766	I	75	“ My pleasure . ”
110810	110816	110817	110817	he	74	“ Stay away from her , ”
110829	110835	110821	110821	Lucas	74	“ She came to me . ”
110844	110859	110836	110836	Gideon	1324	“ You see her coming , I suggest you run in the opposite direction . ”
110860	110875	110836	110836	Gideon	1324	“ Funny . That ’s the advice I gave her in regard to you . ”
110898	110910	110886	110886	Gideon	1324	“ What is it with you and giving people the finger ? ”
110911	110919	110930	110931	the receptionist	70	“ What ? It ’s a classic . ”
110920	110929	110930	110931	the receptionist	70	“ You ca n’t just barge in here ! ”
110944	110957	110939	110939	He	70	“ You can cancel that call to security , we ’re leaving . ”
110965	110972	110973	110973	I	75	“ Did Angus tattle on me ? ”
110983	110996	110973	110973	I	75	“ No . Stop wriggling . All the cars have GPS tracking . ”
110997	111008	110939	110939	He	70	“ You ’re a nut job . You know that ? ”
111019	111051	111009	111009	He	70	“ I am ? What about you ? You ’re all over the place . My mother . Corinne . Goddamned Lucas . What the fuck are you doing , Eva ? ”
111052	111060	111061	111061	I	75	“ It ’s none of your business . ”
111066	111073	111061	111061	I	75	“ We broke up , remember ? ”
111177	111189	111190	111190	He	70	“ Is there anything you do n’t own in New York ? ”
111265	111285	111252	111252	His	70	“ You think you can say a few words and end us ? There is no end , Eva . ”
111310	111315	111316	111316	I	75	“ I miss you , ”
111332	111335	111329	111329	Gideon	1324	“ Angel . ”
111355	111361	111362	111362	he	70	“ What are you doing ? ”
111365	111375	111362	111362	he	70	“ You ’re going around , stirring up everything . ”
111376	111385	111386	111386	I	75	“ I ’ve got time on my hands , ”
111394	111402	111386	111386	I	75	“ since I dumped my asshat boyfriend . ”
111421	111441	111403	111403	He	70	“ You ca n’t make this up with a kiss or a fuck , Gideon . Not this time . ”
111478	111485	111472	111472	His	70	“ You have to trust me . ”
111508	111518	111519	111519	I	75	“ Not when you do n’t talk to me . ”
111544	111594	111595	111595	His	70	“ You put me through hell . On purpose . Made me suffer . And there ’s no end in sight . I do n’t know what the fuck you ’re doing , ace , but this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde shit ai n’t cutting it with me . ”
111618	111624	111595	111595	His	70	“ You ’re completely unmanageable . ”
111625	111638	111644	111644	I	75	“ When I ’ve got clothes on . Get used to it . ”
111685	111705	111648	111648	His	70	“ You put your hand on Corinne ’s back like this again , and I ’m breaking your fingers . ”
111706	111716	111717	111717	he	70	“ You know I do n’t want anyone else , ”
111720	111732	111717	111717	he	70	“ I ca n’t . I ’m consumed with wanting you . ”
111796	111809	111785	111785	I	75	“ Make them ride together . You and I need to talk . ”
111810	111816	111817	111817	Angus	104	“ That was the plan . ”
111845	111849	111850	111850	he	70	“ Miss Tramell , ”
111858	111865	111850	111850	he	70	“ Eva , this is Raúl . ”
111866	111871	111872	111872	I	75	“ We meet again , ”
111875	111885	111872	111872	I	75	“ Did you pass on my message last time ? ”
111894	111898	111886	111886	Gideon	1324	“ He did . ”
111902	111908	111899	111899	I	75	“ Thank you , Raúl . ”
111981	111990	111991	111991	I	75	“ Watching you drive makes me want you , ”
112005	112008	112009	112009	He	1324	“ Christ . ”
112014	112021	112009	112009	He	1324	“ You have a transportation fetish . ”
112022	112029	112030	112030	My	75	“ I have a Gideon fetish . ”
112034	112040	112030	112030	My	75	“ It ’s been weeks . ”
112041	112084	112009	112009	He	1324	“ And I hate every second of it . This is torment for me , Eva . I ca n’t focus . I ca n’t sleep . I lose my temper at the slightest irritants . I ’m in hell without you . ”
112130	112139	112121	112121	I	75	“ Why are you doing this to us ? ”
112140	112150	112151	112151	His	1324	“ I had an opportunity and I took it . ”
112155	112175	112151	112151	His	1324	“ This separation is the price . It wo n’t last forever . I need you to be patient . ”
112181	112193	112176	112176	I	75	“ No , Gideon . I ca n’t . Not anymore . ”
112194	112207	112121	112121	I	75	“ You ’re not leaving me . I wo n’t let you . ”
112208	112232	112176	112176	I	75	“ I ’ve already left . Do n’t you see that ? I ’m living my life and you ’re not in it . ”
112233	112246	112121	112121	I	75	“ I ’m in it every way I can be right now . ”
112247	112264	112265	112265	I	75	“ By having Angus following me around ? Come on . That ’s not a relationship . ”
112273	112280	112265	112265	I	75	“ Not one I want anyway . ”
112281	112284	112285	112285	He	75	“ Eva . ”
112289	112357	112285	112285	He	75	“ My silence is the lesser of two evils . I feel like whether I explain or not , I ’ll drive you away , but explaining carries the greatest risk . You think you want to know , but if I tell you , you ’ll regret it . Trust me when I say there are some aspects of me you do n’t want to see . ”
112358	112369	112370	112370	I	75	“ You have to give me something to work with . ”
112391	112403	112370	112370	I	75	“ I ’ve got nothing right now . I ’m empty . ”
112411	112450	112404	112404	He	75	“ You trust me . Despite what you see to the contrary , you ’ve come to trust in what you know . That ’s huge , Eva . For both of us . For us , period . ”
112451	112457	112404	112404	He	75	“ There is no us . ”
112458	112463	112404	112404	He	75	“ Stop saying that . ”
112464	112508	112404	112404	He	75	“ You wanted my blind trust and you have it , but that ’s all I can give you . You ’ve shared so little of yourself and I ’ve lived with it because I had you . And now I do n’t — ”
112509	112514	112515	112515	he	559	“ You have me , ”
112518	112526	112527	112527	I	75	“ Not the way I need you . ”
112536	112614	112527	112527	I	75	“ You ’ve given me your body and I ’ve been greedy with it , because that ’s the only way you ’re really open to me . And now I do n’t have that , and when I look at what I do have , it ’s just promises . It ’s not enough for me . In the absence of you , all I have is a pile of things you wo n’t tell me . ”
112653	112661	112662	112662	he	559	“ If I lose you , Eva , ”
112666	112683	112662	112662	he	559	“ I have nothing . Everything I ’ve done is so I do n’t lose you . ”
112684	112689	112690	112690	I	75	“ I need more . ”
112698	112726	112690	112690	I	75	“ If I ca n’t have you on the outside , I need to have you on the inside , but you ’ve never let me in . ”
112752	112758	112759	112759	he	559	“ After my dad died , ”
112763	112847	112759	112759	he	559	“ I had a hard time dealing with the changes . I remember that people liked him , liked being around him . He was making everyone rich , right ? And then suddenly the world flipped on its head and everyone hated him . My mother , who ’d been so happy all the time , was crying nonstop . And she and my dad were fighting every day . That ’s what I remember most — the constant yelling and screaming . ”
112871	112961	113031	113031	Tears	130	“ She remarried right away . We moved out of the city . She got pregnant . I never knew when I ’d run across someone my dad had fucked over , and I took a lot of shit for it from other kids . From their parents . Teachers . It was big news . To this day , people still talk about my dad and what he did . I was so angry . At everyone . I had tantrums all the time . I broke things . ”
112971	113030	112962	112962	He	1560	“ After Christopher came along , I got worse , and when he was five , he imitated me , pitching a fit at dinner and shoving his plate across the table and onto the floor . My mom was pregnant with Ireland then , and she and Vidal decided it was time to put me into therapy . ”
113064	113140	113031	113031	Tears	130	“ They came out to the house — the shrink and a doctoral candidate she was supervising . It started out all right . They both were nice , attractive , patient . But soon the shrink was spending most of the time counseling my mother , who was having a difficult pregnancy in addition to two young boys who were out of control . I was left alone with him more and more frequently . ”
113181	113192	113193	113193	I	75	“ You do n’t have to tell me any more , ”
113226	113252	113217	113217	His	1324	“ He made me come . Every goddamned time , he would n’t stop until I came , so he could say I liked it . ”
113377	113425	113369	113369	I	75	“ Hush , baby . I understand . I know how that feels , the way they gloat afterward . And the shame and confusion and guilt you felt . It ’s not your fault . You did n’t want it . You did n’t enjoy it . ”
113426	113435	113436	113436	he	1324	“ I let him touch me at first , ”
113439	113487	113436	113436	he	1324	“ He said it was my age … hormones … I needed to masturbate and I ’d be calmer . Less angry all the time . He touched me , said he ’d show me how to do it right . That I was doing it wrong — ”
113488	113493	113494	113494	I	75	“ Gideon , no . ”
113537	113579	113528	113528	Gideon	1324	“ You were a child in the hands of an adult who knew all the right buttons to push . They want to make it our fault so they have no culpability in their crime , but it ’s not true . ”
113603	113621	113591	113591	I	75	“ I love you . And I believe you . And none of this was your fault . ”
113643	113649	113635	113635	he	1324	“ Do n’t leave me . ”
113650	113661	113667	113667	he	1324	“ Leave you ? I ’m going to marry you . ”
113722	113741	113719	113719	her	1572	“ You ’ve got thirty seconds to move on or I ’ll cite you both for public indecency . ”
113812	113817	113801	113801	he	1324	“ I love you . ”
113862	113867	113859	113859	I	75	“ Say that again . ”
113921	113941	113905	113905	his	1324	“ I love you . Still not the right word , but I know you want to hear it . ”
113942	113949	113950	113950	I	75	“ I need to hear it , ”
113954	113963	113968	113968	he	1324	“ As long as you understand the difference . ”
113972	114013	113968	113968	he	1324	“ People get over love . They can live without it , they can move on . Love can be lost and found again . But that wo n’t happen for me . I wo n’t survive you , Eva . ”
114029	114072	113968	113968	he	1324	“ I ’m obsessed with you , angel . Addicted to you . You ’re everything I ’ve ever wanted or needed , everything I ’ve ever dreamed of . You ’re everything . I live and breathe you . For you . ”
114083	114101	114073	114073	I	75	“ There ’s so much out there for you . You just do n’t know it yet . ”
114102	114127	114128	114128	He	75	“ I do n’t need anything else . I get out of bed every morning and face the world because you ’re in it . ”
114160	114188	114144	114144	He	75	“ Because of you , the world makes sense to me in a way it did n’t before . I have a place now , with you . ”
114253	114262	114263	114263	I	75	“ When are you coming back to me ? ”
114267	114274	114278	114278	he	75	“ As soon as I can . ”
114285	114288	114278	114278	he	75	“ Wait . ”
114401	114408	114414	114414	his	58	“ Lunch with a beautiful woman ? ”
114417	114420	114414	114414	his	58	“ Absolutely . ”
114421	114433	114414	114414	his	58	“ Any time you have free this week would be great . ”
114434	114439	114440	114440	he	58	“ How about today ? ”
114443	114457	114440	114440	he	58	“ I occasionally get a craving for that deli you took me to . ”
114458	114465	114414	114414	his	58	“ Works for me . Noon ? ”
114492	114495	114482	114482	He	58	“ Help . ”
114501	114504	114496	114496	I	75	“ Sure . ”
114610	114618	114619	114619	he	58	“ I ’m stoked you called me , ”
114622	114652	114619	114619	he	58	“ But I have to admit , I ’m curious about why . I ’m wondering if it has anything to do with Gideon getting back together with Corinne . ”
114714	114723	114724	114724	I	75	“ Why do you hate him so much ? ”
114783	114792	114757	114757	He	1324	“ Why ? You want to exchange notes ? ”
114793	114799	114765	114765	his	1324	“ Sure . Why not ? ”
114970	114986	114957	114957	my	75	“ I ’d like to take you out sometime , Eva . Dinner , perhaps ? ”
114987	114994	114995	114995	I	75	“ I ’ll get in touch , ”
114998	115019	114995	114995	I	75	“ My roommate ’s really sick right now and I need to be around for him as much as possible . ”
115020	115027	115028	115028	He	58	“ You ’ve got my number . ”
115048	115056	115040	115040	I	75	“ And I ’ll keep in touch . ”
115087	115091	115092	115092	He	58	“ Miss Tramell . ”
115095	115104	115092	115092	He	58	“ Could you come with me , please ? ”
115172	115188	115189	115189	he	1324	“ Are there other people in my life you plan on harassing on my behalf ? ”
115192	115200	115165	115165	he	1324	“ Are you spying on me again ? ”
115201	115209	115165	115165	he	1324	“ Keeping a protective eye on you . ”
115217	115230	115210	115210	I	75	“ And how do you know if I harassed him or not ? ”
115236	115242	115231	115231	His	1324	“ Because I know you . ”
115243	115258	115259	115259	I	75	“ Well , I did n’t harass him . Really . I did n’t , ”
115270	115290	115259	115259	I	75	“ I was going to , but then I did n’t . And why are we in this room ? ”
115291	115302	115231	115231	His	1324	“ Are you on some kind of crusade , angel ? ”
115332	115377	115259	115259	I	75	“ Do you realize that your reaction to my lunch with Christopher is very calm ? And so is my reaction to you spending time with Corinne ? We ’re both reacting totally different from the way we would have just a month ago . ”
115398	115414	115382	115382	He	1600	“ We trust each other , Eva . It feels good , does n’t it ? ”
115415	115442	115395	115395	his	1600	“ Trusting you does n’t mean I ’m any less baffled by what ’s going on between us . Why are we hiding in this office ? ”
115443	115447	115448	115448	Gideon	1324	“ Plausible deniability . ”
115472	115477	115462	115462	he	1324	“ I love you . ”
115478	115487	115459	115459	his	1324	“ You ’re getting good at saying that . ”
115497	115519	115488	115488	He	1324	“ Remember that night , when you had your nightmare and I was out late ? You wondered where I was . ”
115520	115525	115462	115462	he	1324	“ I still wonder . ”
115526	115565	115488	115488	He	1324	“ I was at the hotel , clearing out that room . My fuck pad , as you called it . Explaining that while you were puking your guts out did n’t seem to be the appropriate time . ”
115609	115643	115599	115599	His	1324	“ I ’d completely forgotten about it until it came up with Dr. Petersen . We both know I ’ll never use it again . My girl prefers modes of transportation to beds . ”
115883	115888	115879	115879	I	75	“ Hi , Mom . ”
115889	115900	115901	115901	she	233	“ I do n’t understand what they ’re looking for ! ”
115909	115931	115901	115901	she	233	“ They wo n’t leave Richard alone . They went to his offices today and took copies of the security tapes . ”
115932	115936	115879	115879	I	75	“ The detectives ? ”
115937	115949	115901	115901	she	233	“ Yes . They ’re relentless . What do they want ? ”
115959	115982	115950	115950	I	75	“ To catch a killer . They probably just want to see Nathan coming and going . Check the timing or something . ”
115983	115988	115879	115879	I	75	“ That ’s ridiculous ! ”
115989	116018	115950	115950	I	75	“ Yeah , it ’s also just a guess . Do n’t worry . There ’s nothing to find because Stanton ’s innocent . Everything will be okay . ”
116019	116030	116031	116031	she	233	“ He ’s been so good about this , Eva , ”
116035	116043	116031	116031	she	233	“ He ’s so good to me . ”
116055	116087	116044	116044	I	75	“ I know , Mom . I get it . Dad gets it . You ’re where you should be . No one ’s judging you . We ’re all good . ”
116217	116225	116226	116226	I	75	“ Call me if you need me , ”
116241	116249	116226	116226	I	75	“ I ’ll be home all night . ”
116275	116282	116269	116269	I	75	“ Honey , I ’m home ! ”
116342	116347	116348	116348	she	94	“ Hey , honey , ”
116384	116392	116370	116371	Tatiana Cherlin	94	“ Take care of him for me . ”
116446	116449	116434	116434	He	1952	“ Hey . ”
116450	116463	116434	116434	He	1952	“ Hey , yourself . Looks like you had a good day . ”
116464	116468	116434	116434	He	1952	“ Hell yeah . ”
116474	116488	116471	116471	me	75	“ No judgment here , but I assumed you and Tatiana were done . ”
116489	116497	116498	116498	He	1952	“ I never thought we got started . ”
116509	116548	116498	116498	He	1952	“ Then she showed up today all worried and apologetic . She ’s been in Prague and did n’t hear about me until this morning . She rushed over wearing that , like she read my perverted mind . ”
116557	116563	116549	116549	I	75	“ Guess she knows you . ”
116564	116569	116570	116570	He	1952	“ Guess she does . ”
116573	116608	116570	116570	He	1952	“ We ’ll see how it goes . She knows Trey ’s in my life and I hope to keep him there . Trey , though … I know he wo n’t like it . ”
116631	116657	116609	116609	I	75	“ How about we forget about our significant others for a night and have an action movie marathon ? I brought some nonalcoholic champagne home . ”
116662	116670	116658	116658	His	1952	“ Where ’s the fun in that ? ”
116671	116683	116684	116684	I	75	“ Ca n’t mix your meds with booze , you know , ”
116688	116696	116658	116658	His	1952	“ No Krav Maga for you tonight ? ”
116697	116732	116658	116658	His	1952	“ I ’ll make it up tomorrow . I feel like chilling with you . I want to sprawl on the couch , and eat pizza with chopsticks and Chinese food with my fingers . ”
116733	116742	116743	116743	He	1952	“ You ’re a rebel , baby girl . ”
116746	116755	116743	116743	He	1952	“ And you ’ve got yourself a date . ”
116773	116776	116777	116777	I	75	“ Yes , ”
116871	116877	116878	116878	he	1324	“ Good . Very good , ”
116881	116890	116878	116878	he	1324	“ You ’re firing on all cylinders tonight . ”
116891	116899	116860	116860	I	75	“ Thanks . Wanna try it again ? ”
116900	116910	116911	116911	he	1324	“ Take a ten - minute break and hydrate , ”
116914	116926	116911	116911	he	1324	“ I need to talk to Jeremy before he takes off . ”
117095	117099	117100	117100	she	1624	“ Miss Tramell , ”
117104	117119	117100	117100	she	1624	“ Fancy running into you here . Have you been working with Parker long ? ”
117120	117134	117100	117100	she	1624	“ About a month . It ’s good to see you , Detective . ”
117135	117142	117143	117143	Her	1624	“ No , it ’s not . ”
117148	117170	117143	117143	Her	1624	“ At least you do n’t think so . Yet . Maybe you still wo n’t when we ’re done chatting . ”
117188	117200	117171	117171	I	75	“ I ca n’t speak to you without my attorney present . ”
117207	117232	117201	117201	She	1624	“ I ’m off - duty . But anyway , you do n’t have to say anything . I ’ll do all the talking . ”
117255	117264	117265	117265	She	1624	“ How about we move a little higher ? ”
117296	117360	117282	117282	she	1624	“ It ’s different here at night . I usually catch the day sessions . I told myself that on the off chance I happened to run into you off - duty someday , I ’d talk to you . I figured the odds of that were nil . And lo and behold , here you are . It must be a sign . ”
117369	117383	117361	117361	I	75	“ You do n’t strike me as the type to believe in signs . ”
117384	117401	117402	117402	Her	1624	“ You ’ve got me there , but I ’ll make an exception in this case . ”
117424	117433	117419	117419	she	1624	“ I think your boyfriend killed Nathan Barker . ”
117442	117452	117453	117453	she	1624	“ I ’ll never be able to prove it , ”
117457	117494	117453	117453	she	1624	“ He ’s too smart . Too thorough . The whole thing was precisely premeditated . The moment Gideon Cross came to the decision to kill Nathan Barker , he had his ducks in a row . ”
117526	117575	117522	117522	she	1624	“ I believe it started the Monday after your roommate was attacked . When we searched the hotel room where Barker ’s body was discovered , we found photos . A lot of photos of you , but the ones I ’m talking about were of your roommate . ”
117576	117579	117522	117522	she	1624	“ Cary ? ”
117580	117628	117522	117522	she	1624	“ If I were to present this to the ADA for an arrest warrant , I would say that Nathan Barker attacked Cary Taylor as a way to intimidate and threaten Gideon Cross . My guess is that Cross was n’t conceding to Barker ’s blackmail demands . ”
117674	117743	117670	117670	them	1631	“ At that point , I think Cross perceived you to be in mortal danger . And you know what ? He was right . I ’ve seen the evidence we collected from Barker ’s room — photos , detailed notes of your daily schedule , news clippings … even some of your garbage . Usually when we find that sort of thing , it ’s too late . ”
117744	117750	117759	117759	me	75	“ Nathan was watching me ? ”
117761	117817	117670	117670	them	1631	“ He was stalking you . The blackmail demands he made on your stepfather and Cross were just an escalation of that . I think Cross was getting too close to you , and Barker felt threatened by your relationship . I believe he hoped Cross would step away if he knew about your past . ”
117836	117847	117848	117848	Graves	181	“ So here ’s how I think it went down . ”
117863	117928	117848	117848	Graves	181	“ Cross cut you off , started seeing an old flame . That served two purposes — it made Barker relax , and it wiped out Cross ’s motive . Why would he kill a man over a woman he ’d dumped ? He set that up pretty well — he did n’t tell you . You strengthened the lie with your honest reactions . ”
117945	118052	117929	117929	Her	1632	“ Cross does n’t hire out the job . That would be stupid . He does n’t want the money trail or a hit man who could rat him out . Besides , this is personal . You ’re personal . He wants the threat gone without a doubt . He sets up a last - minute party at one of his properties for some vodka company of his . Now he ’s got a rock - solid alibi . Even the press is there to snap pictures . And he knows precisely where you are and that your alibi is rock - solid , too . ”
118155	118286	118140	118140	Graves	181	“ I ’ll admit , the party tripped me up a bit . How do you break an alibi like that ? I had to go back to the hotel three times before I learned there was a fire in the kitchen that night . Nothing major , but the entire hotel was evacuated for close to an hour . All the guests were milling on the sidewalk . Cross was in and out of the hotel doing whatever an owner would do under those circumstances . I talked to a half dozen employees who saw him or talked to him around then , but none of them could pinpoint times for me . All agreed it was chaotic . Who could keep track of one guy in that mess ? ”
118311	118441	118305	118305	She	1636	“ I timed the walk from the service entrance — where Cross was seen talking to the FDNY — to Barker ’s hotel a couple blocks over . Fifteen minutes each way . Barker was taken out by a single stab wound to the chest . Right in the heart . Would ’ve taken no more than a minute . No defensive wounds and he was found just inside the door . My guess ? He opened the door to Cross and it was over before he could blink . And get this … That hotel is owned by a subsidiary of Cross Industries . And the security cameras in the building just happened to be down for an upgrade that ’s been in the works for several months . ”
118442	118445	118446	118446	I	75	“ Coincidence , ”
118498	118504	118505	118505	Graves	181	“ Sure . Why not ? ”
118528	118621	118518	118518	She	1640	“ So here ’s the thing : I could keep digging and spending time on this case while there are others on my desk . But what ’s the point ? Cross is n’t a danger to the public . My partner will tell you it ’s never okay to take the law into your own hands . And for the most part , I ’m on the same page . But Nathan Barker was going to kill you . Maybe not next week . Maybe not next year . But someday . ”
118659	118665	118666	118666	she	1640	“ I burned my notes , ”
118670	118709	118666	118666	she	1640	“ My partner agrees we ’ve hit a dead end . No one gives a shit that Nathan Barker is n’t breathing our air anymore . Even his father told me he considered his son dead years ago . ”
118727	118736	118710	118710	I	75	“ I do n’t know what to say . ”
118737	118756	118757	118757	She	1640	“ You broke up with him on the Saturday after we interrupted your dinner , did n’t you ? ”
118763	118834	118757	118757	She	1640	“ He was in the station then , giving a statement . He stepped out of the room , but I could see him through the window in the door . The only time I ’ve seen pain like that is when I ’m notifying next of kin . To be honest , that ’s why I ’m telling you this now — so you can go back to him . ”
118835	118839	118840	118840	I	75	“ Thank you . ”
118879	118890	118860	118860	she	1640	“ I ’m not the one you should be thanking . ”
119045	119054	119042	119042	I	75	“ I do n’t have a key anymore . ”
119074	119081	119071	119071	He	1324	“ Eva ? What ’s wrong ? ”
119082	119090	119091	119091	I	75	“ I ran into Detective Graves tonight . ”
119100	119107	119091	119091	I	75	“ They ’re dropping the case . ”
119253	119261	119246	119246	His	1324	“ Where do we go from here ? ”
119266	119274	119262	119262	I	75	“ Wherever this takes us . Together . ”
