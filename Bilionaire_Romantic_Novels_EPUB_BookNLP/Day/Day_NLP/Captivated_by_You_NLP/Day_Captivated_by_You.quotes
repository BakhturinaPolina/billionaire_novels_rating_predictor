1745	1752	1742	1742	She	49	“ It ’s not like that . ”
1753	1766	1742	1742	She	49	“ Is it the voice ? The tattoos ? His magic dick ? ”
1767	1785	1742	1742	She	49	“ Stop it . It ’s not easy talking about this . Do n’t make it harder . ”

2368	2383	2338	2338	She	49	“ Congratulations , dickhead . You just hurt me worse than he ever did . ”

2572	2597	2602	2602	her	49	“ So you ’re going to tear at me to hold on ? Why do n’t you get that I ’m not going anywhere ? ”

2658	2665	2666	2666	Her	49	“ Handle me , you mean ? ”
2671	2723	2666	2666	Her	49	“ Because I ’m what ’s wrong here . I knew Brett during a time in my life when I hated myself but wanted other people to love me . And now he ’s acting the way I wanted him to back then and it ’s giving me a head trip . ”
2724	2729	2730	2730	I	46	“ Christ , Eva . ”
2740	2752	2730	2730	I	46	“ How am I not supposed to feel threatened by that ? ”
2753	2818	2666	2666	Her	49	“ You ’re supposed to trust me . I told you because I did n’t want you to get weird vibes and jump to conclusions . I wanted to be honest about it so you would n’t feel threatened . I know I ’ve got some stuff to work out in my head . I ’m going to see Dr. Travis this weekend and — ”
2819	2828	2730	2730	I	46	“ Shrinks are n’t a cure - all ! ”
2829	2836	2666	2666	Her	49	“ Do n’t yell at me . ”
2869	2901	2851	2852	My wife	49	“ We ’re not running to a damned doctor every time we ’ve got a problem . It ’s you and me in this marriage . Not the goddamned psychiatric community ! ”
2937	2955	2932	2932	she	49	“ You may think you do n’t need help , ace , but I know I do . ”
2956	2963	2964	2964	I	46	“ What I need is you . ”
2972	2991	2964	2964	I	46	“ I need my wife . And I need her thinking about me and not some other guy ! ”
2992	3004	2932	2932	she	49	“ You ’re making me wish I had n’t said anything . ”
3012	3024	3005	3005	My	46	“ I knew how you felt . I ’ve seen it . ”
3025	3033	3034	3034	She	49	“ God . You jealous , crazy … ”
3038	3073	3034	3034	She	49	“ Why do n’t you understand how much I love you ? Brett ’s got nothing on you . Nothing . But honestly , I do n’t want to be around you right now . ”
3095	3107	3088	3088	I	46	“ Ca n’t you see what you ’re doing to me ? ”
3114	3154	3108	3108	Eva	49	“ I do n’t get you , Gideon . How can you just flip a switch and turn your feelings off ? Knowing how I feel about Corinne , how could you throw her in my face like that ? ”
3155	3170	3171	3171	I	46	“ You ’re the reason I breathe , I ca n’t turn it off . ”
3179	3222	3171	3171	I	46	“ I think of nothing but you . All day . Every day . Everything I do , I do with you in mind . There ’s no room for anyone else . It kills me that you have room for him . ”
3223	3229	3171	3171	I	46	“ You ’re not listening . ”
3230	3239	3171	3171	I	46	“ Just stay the hell away from him . ”
3240	3249	3250	3250	Her	49	“ That ’s avoidance , not a solution . ”
3257	3275	3250	3250	Her	49	“ I ’m broken , Gideon , you know that . I ’m piecing myself back together . ”
3291	3304	3305	3305	she	49	“ Thanks to you I ’m stronger than I ’ve ever been , ”
3309	3339	3305	3305	she	49	“ but there are still cracks , and when I find them , I have to figure out what made them and how to seal them up . Permanently . ”
3340	3348	3349	3349	My	46	“ What the fuck does that mean ? ”
3371	3376	3361	3361	She	49	“ Gideon , no … ”
3403	3409	3397	3397	She	49	“ Do n’t fight me . ”
3410	3420	3385	3385	her	49	“ You ca n’t just screw our problems away . ”
3421	3429	3430	3430	My	46	“ I just want to screw you . ”
3487	3492	3493	3493	She	49	“ Let me go . ”
3537	3540	3541	3541	Eva	49	“ Crossfire . ”
3649	3658	3659	3659	I	46	“ You ’re going to stop fighting me , ”
3664	3672	3659	3659	I	46	“ And I ’m going to apologize . ”
3746	3751	3721	3721	she	49	“ I ’m sorry . ”
3820	3828	3841	3841	She	49	“ I need your support , Gideon . ”
3829	3840	3841	3841	She	49	“ I need you to tell him you ’re married . ”
3849	3855	3841	3841	She	49	“ I ’m going to . ”
3895	3898	3888	3888	Her	49	“ Ace … ”
4038	4049	4033	4033	I	46	“ You ’ll take one of the jets to California . ”
4150	4154	4155	4155	she	49	“ Will I ? ”
4177	4180	4181	4181	I	46	“ Yes . ”
4187	4198	4181	4181	I	46	“ It ’s faster , more comfortable , and safer . ”
4203	4207	4199	4199	Her	49	“ All right . ”
4233	4240	4241	4241	she	49	“ You get to tell Cary , ”
4316	4324	4325	4325	I	46	“ Ask me to come with you , ”
4346	4402	4342	4342	Her	49	“ I ca n’t . If I ’m going to start telling people we ’re married , I have to start with Cary , and I ca n’t do that with you around . I do n’t want him to feel like he ’s on the outside of a life I ’m creating with you . ”
4403	4416	4342	4342	Her	49	“ I do n’t want to be on the outside , either . ”
4424	4440	4417	4417	She	49	“ Spending private time with friends does n’t make us any less of a couple . ”
4441	4459	4417	4417	She	49	“ I prefer to spend time with you . You ’re the most interesting person I know . ”
4511	4514	4515	4515	I	46	“ Umm , ”
4536	4541	4524	4524	My	46	“ Do that again . ”
4542	4552	4553	4553	she	49	“ I ’m so hot for you right now , ”
4564	4571	4524	4524	My	46	“ I ’m good with that . ”
4580	4588	4572	4572	Her	49	“ I feel so awesome right now . ”
4589	4598	4599	4599	Her	49	“ Better than you did in the hallway ? ”
4618	4627	4628	4628	Her	49	“ That ’s a different kind of awesome . ”
4657	4680	4655	4655	me	46	“ That was the best compliment , ace . Especially coming from the Gideon Cross . You meet fascinating people every day . ”
4681	4696	4647	4647	her	49	“ And wish they ’d go away so I can get back to you . ”
4701	4712	4697	4697	Her	49	“ God , I love you so much it hurts . ”
4766	4776	4777	4777	she	49	“ I want you to do something for me , ”
4780	4785	4777	4777	she	49	“ Anything . Everything . ”
4786	4793	4752	4752	she	49	“ Let ’s have a party . ”
4804	4814	4752	4752	she	49	“ Great . I ’ll set up the swing . ”
4824	4833	4818	4818	Eva	49	“ Not that kind of party , fiend . ”
4837	4840	4834	4834	I	46	“ Bummer . ”
4848	4861	4841	4841	She	49	“ How about I promise the swing in return for the party ? ”
4862	4870	4871	4871	I	46	“ Ah , now we ’re talking . ”
4879	4888	4871	4871	I	46	“ Tell me what you have in mind . ”
4889	4898	4841	4841	She	49	“ Booze and friends , yours and mine . ”
4899	4903	4904	4904	I	46	“ All right . ”
4909	4931	4904	4904	I	46	“ I ’ll see you your booze and friends , and raise you a quickie in a dark corner somewhere during . ”
5007	5014	5015	5015	she	49	“ You drive a hard bargain , ”
5018	5023	5015	5015	she	49	“ Exactly my intention . ”
5024	5029	5030	5030	She	49	“ Okay , then . ”
5035	5052	5030	5030	She	49	“ I ’ll see you your quickie and raise you a hand job under the table . ”
5057	5060	5061	5061	I	46	“ Clothed , ”
5077	5090	5108	5108	She	49	“ I think you need to revisit and revise , Mr. Cross . ”
5091	5107	5108	5108	She	49	“ I think you ’ll need to work harder to convince me , Mrs. Cross . ”
5179	5183	5184	5184	Scott	303	“ Good morning , ”
5193	5228	5184	5184	Scott	303	“ PR called a few minutes ago . They ’re fielding an unusual amount of inquiries about a rumored engagement between you and Miss Tramell . They ’d like to know how to respond . ”
5229	5234	5235	5235	I	46	“ They should confirm . ”
5253	5256	5250	5250	He	300	“ Congratulations . ”
5257	5261	5262	5262	I	46	“ Thank you . ”
5343	5357	5358	5358	I	46	“ Miss Tramell and I will marry before the end of the year , ”
5362	5398	5358	5358	I	46	“ All interview and photo requests for either of us should be routed through Cross Industries . And tell security downstairs the same . No one should get to her without going through me first . ”
5399	5433	5475	5475	I	46	“ I ’ll let them know . Also , Mr. Madani wanted to be notified when you got in . He ’d like a few minutes with you before the meeting this morning . ”
5434	5442	5358	5358	I	46	“ I ’m ready when he is . ”
5443	5446	5447	5448	Arash Madani	0	“ Great , ”
5454	5474	5447	5448	Arash Madani	0	“ There used to be days when you were here before seven . You ’re slacking off , Cross . ”
5612	5627	5628	5628	he	303	“ We ’ve received a respectable bid on the property on Thirty - sixth , ”
5631	5634	5628	5628	he	303	“ Oh ? ”
5660	5665	5648	5648	Eva	49	“ That ’s good . ”
5666	5671	5672	5672	he	303	“ That ’s curious , ”
5684	5710	5672	5672	he	303	“ considering how slowly the market ’s recovering . I had to dig through several layers , but the bidder is a subsidiary of LanCorp . ”
5711	5714	5648	5648	Eva	49	“ Interesting . ”
5715	5751	5672	5672	he	303	“ Cocky . Landon knows the next highest bid is a ways off — about ten million ways . I recommend we pull the property off the market and revisit in a year or two . ”
5752	5755	5648	5648	Eva	49	“ No . ”
5765	5771	5648	5648	Eva	49	“ Let him have it . ”

5810	5816	5797	5797	I	46	“ I have my reasons . ”
5817	5878	5904	5904	Eva	49	“ That ’s what you said when I advised you to sell it a few years ago and you chose to sink millions in renovations into it instead . An expense that you ’re just finally breaking even on , and now you want to offload it in a still - shaky market to a guy who wants your head ? ”
5879	5893	5906	5906	my	46	“ It ’s never a bad time to sell real estate in Manhattan . ”
5907	5911	5904	5904	Eva	49	“ fuck pad . ”
5912	5939	5904	5904	Eva	49	“ There are better times , and you know it . Landon knows it . You sell to him , you ’ll only be encouraging him . ”
5940	5950	5904	5904	Eva	49	“ Good . Maybe he ’ll up his game . ”
6041	6044	6045	6045	Arash	0	“ Hey , ”
6055	6072	6045	6045	Arash	0	“ it ’s your business . I just need to know if the rules have changed . ”
6073	6078	6045	6045	Arash	0	“ Nothing ’s changed . ”
6079	6112	6045	6045	Arash	0	“ If you believe that , Cross , you ’re further out of the game than I thought . While Landon ’s plotting your ruin , you ’re off at the beach . ”
6113	6126	6127	6127	I	46	“ Stop kicking my ass for taking a weekend off , Arash . ”
6293	6337	6286	6286	Arash	0	“ I ’m not going to say I would n’t hole up with a babe like Eva Tramell if I could . But I ’d have my goddamn cell phone with me . Especially in the middle of a high - stakes negotiation . ”
6372	6380	6361	6361	I	46	“ You ’re making me pity you . ”
6381	6404	6286	6286	Arash	0	“ LanCorp ’s acquisition of that software set you back years in research and development . And it ’s made him cocky . ”
6423	6435	6415	6415	Landon	68	“ That software ’s next to worthless without PosIT ’s hardware . ”
6441	6444	6436	6436	He	68	“ So ? ”
6445	6451	6436	6436	He	68	“ Agenda item number three . ”
6456	6466	6452	6452	He	68	“ It said To Be Determined on my copy . ”
6467	6483	6436	6436	He	68	“ Well , it says PosIT on my mine . That game enough for you ? ”
6484	6487	6452	6452	He	68	“ Damn . ”
6503	6518	6495	6495	Scott	303	“ A couple things , Mr. Cross . Miss Tramell is on line one . ”
6519	6525	6526	6526	I	46	“ Thank you , Scott . ”
6555	6569	6547	6547	Landon	68	“ When I ’m clear , I need Victor Reyes on the line . ”
6570	6582	6583	6583	he	68	“ Will do . Also , Mrs. Vidal is at reception , ”
6593	6604	6583	6583	he	68	“ Would you like me to postpone the morning meeting ? ”
6689	6695	6696	6696	I	46	“ Buy me twenty minutes , ”
6700	6720	6696	6696	I	46	“ I ’ll take the calls with Miss Tramell and Reyes , then you can bring Mrs. Vidal back . ”
6721	6725	6752	6752	Gideon	339	“ Got it . ”
6745	6748	6696	6696	I	46	“ ANGEL . ”
6813	6816	6817	6817	I	46	“ Hi . ”
6829	6836	6817	6817	I	46	“ Is it a bad time ? ”
6837	6847	6850	6850	his	46	“ If you need me , I ’m here . ”
6858	6865	6850	6850	his	46	“ I can call back later . ”
6866	6869	6874	6874	he	46	“ Eva . ”
6890	6896	6874	6874	he	46	“ Say what you need . ”
6943	6949	6939	6939	I	46	“ I need a favor . ”
6950	6957	6925	6925	he	46	“ I ’ll enjoy the payback . ”
7002	7017	6991	6991	I	46	“ Does security have the home addresses of everyone who works in the Crossfire ? ”
7018	7032	6925	6925	he	46	“ They have copies of IDs . Tell me why you ’re asking . ”
7033	7059	6991	6991	I	46	“ The receptionist here at work is a friend of mine and she ’s been out sick all week . I ’m worried about her . ”
7060	7085	6925	6925	he	46	“ If you ’re hoping to head over to her place and check up on her , you should get the address from her . ”
7086	7096	7097	7097	I	46	“ I would if she ’d return my calls . ”
7124	7135	6925	6925	he	46	“ Are you not on speaking terms at the moment ? ”
7136	7181	7200	7206	any other guy who ’d said that	323	“ No , we ’re not fighting or anything . It ’s just not like her to not get in touch with me , especially when she ’s calling in sick to work every day . She ’s a chatty girl , you know ? ”
7182	7185	7186	7186	he	322	“ No , ”
7189	7195	7186	7186	he	322	“ I have no idea . ”
7267	7294	7346	7355	the dark - haired , dark - eyed security specialist	325	“ Then you ’ll have to take my word for it , ace . I just … I want to make sure she ’s all right . ”
7295	7338	7346	7355	the dark - haired , dark - eyed security specialist	325	“ My lawyer ’s standing right here , but I do n’t have to ask him about the legality of giving you the information you ’re asking for via the means you ’ve suggested . Call Raúl . He ’ll find her . ”
7339	7342	7346	7355	the dark - haired , dark - eyed security specialist	325	“ Really ? ”
7361	7371	7346	7355	the dark - haired , dark - eyed security specialist	325	“ Is he going to be okay with that ? ”
7372	7384	7346	7355	the dark - haired , dark - eyed security specialist	325	“ Angel , he ’s paid to be okay with everything . ”
7385	7388	7389	7389	I	46	“ Oh . ”
7497	7504	7494	7494	I	46	“ How do I reach him ? ”
7505	7513	7478	7479	Sam Yimara	74	“ I ’ll text you his number . ”
7514	7519	7494	7494	I	46	“ Okay . Thanks . ”
7520	7538	7478	7479	Sam Yimara	74	“ I want either myself , Angus , or Raúl with you when you go see her . ”
7539	7549	7550	7550	I	46	“ And that would n’t be awkward at all . ”
7598	7621	7579	7579	Megumi	77	“ Do n’t throw me that ‘ chicks before dicks ’ line , Eva . You need to give me something here . ”
7654	7679	7643	7643	I	46	“ Okay , okay . If she ’s not back in the office on Monday , we ’ll figure out how to handle it . ”
7680	7686	7622	7622	I	46	“ Good . Anything else ? ”
7687	7694	7695	7695	My	46	“ No . That ’s it . ”
7722	7761	7717	7717	I	46	“ Thank you . I hope you have an amazing day . I love you madly , you know . And no , I do n’t expect you to say it back while your lawyer ’s hanging around . ”
7762	7765	7772	7772	his	328	“ Eva . ”
7783	7793	7772	7772	his	328	“ Come see me when you get off work . ”
7794	7808	7717	7717	I	46	“ Sure . Do n’t forget to call Cary about taking your jet . ”
7809	7814	7772	7772	his	328	“ Consider it done . ”
7825	7831	7717	7717	I	46	“ Good morning , Eva . ”
7843	7847	7832	7832	I	46	“ Good morning . ”
7848	7859	7860	7860	Her	78	“ I wanted to congratulate you again on your engagement . ”
7873	7889	7860	7860	Her	78	“ I ’m sorry , I had n’t realized you and Gideon Cross were dating . ”
7890	7907	7930	7930	she	78	“ That ’s okay . I try not to talk about my personal life at work . ”
7959	7982	7956	7956	She	78	“ That ’s good ! But just goes to show that I ’m not keeping my ear close enough to the ground . ”
7983	7992	7956	7956	She	78	“ I doubt you ’re missing anything important . ”
7993	8006	7956	7956	She	78	“ Are you the reason Cross approached us with the Kingsman campaign ? ”
8150	8160	8161	8161	I	46	“ Mr. Cross approached the agency on his own , ”
8169	8181	8161	8161	I	46	“ Which was a great decision . Mark rocked that RFP . ”
8185	8224	8182	8182	Christine	78	“ He did . All right . I ’ll let you get back to work . Mark ’s been singing your praises , too , by the way . We ’re glad to have you on our team . ”
8461	8476	8449	8449	My	46	“ How long were you going to wait to tell me about your engagement ? ”
8499	8514	8488	8488	My	46	“ Hi , Mom . I was going to call you during my lunch . ”
8515	8521	8522	8522	she	335	“ You knew last night ! ”
8525	8592	8522	8522	she	335	“ Did he ask you on the way to dinner ? Because you did n’t say anything about a proposal when we talked about him asking your father and Richard for permission . I saw the ring at Cipriani ’s and was pretty sure , but when you did n’t say anything , I did n’t push because you ’ve been so touchy lately . And — ”
8593	8603	8604	8604	I	46	“ And you ’ve been violating the law lately , ”
8608	8632	8488	8488	My	46	“ — Gideon was wearing a ring , too , so I thought maybe it was some kind of promise thing or something — ”
8633	8637	8522	8522	she	335	“ It is . ”
8638	8671	8488	8488	My	46	“ — and then I read about your engagement online ! I mean , really , Eva . No mother should find out on the Internet that her daughter is getting married ! ”
8685	8693	8672	8672	I	46	“ What ? Where on the Internet ? ”
8694	8729	8488	8488	My	46	“ Take your pick ! Page Six , HuffPost … And let me tell you again , there is no way I can pull together a proper wedding before the end of the year ! ”
8880	8885	8886	8886	I	46	“ Oh my God , ”
8891	8903	8886	8886	I	46	“ I have to go . I have to call Dad . ”
8904	8923	8925	8926	my dad	339	“ Eva ! You need to come over after work . We have to talk about the wedding . ”
8947	8963	8925	8926	my dad	339	“ I ca n’t . I ’m going to San Diego this weekend with Cary . ”
8964	8982	8886	8886	I	46	“ I think you need to put off any travel for a while . You need to — ”
8983	8990	8991	8991	I	46	“ Start without me , Mom , ”
9000	9010	8991	8991	I	46	“ I do n’t have anything specific in mind . ”
9011	9018	8886	8886	I	46	“ You ca n’t be seri — ”
9019	9028	9029	9029	I	46	“ Got ta go . Have to work . ”
9044	9047	9048	9049	Mark Garrity	757	“ Hey . ”
9067	9072	9048	9049	Mark Garrity	757	“ Ready to roll ? ”
9073	9076	9077	9077	My	46	“ Uh … ”
9196	9199	9200	9200	I	46	“ Absolutely , ”
9271	9278	9307	9307	his	344	“ MAN , YOU ARE smooth . ”
9293	9299	9279	9279	I	46	“ Are you still here ? ”
9334	9343	9344	9344	he	344	“ Schmoozing the father - in - law , ”
9347	9372	9344	9344	he	344	“ I ’m impressed . I expect Eva will be impressed , too . Bet you ’re counting on that heading into the weekend . ”
9395	9432	9386	9386	I	46	“ She ’s about to go out of town . And you have to head into the conference room before they get too restless in there . I ’ll join you as soon as I can . ”
9436	9502	9433	9433	He	344	“ Yes , I heard . Your mother ’s here . Let the wedding insanity begin . Since you ’re free this weekend , how about we round up some of the usual suspects at my place tonight ? It ’s been a while , and your bachelor days are numbered . Well , technically they ’re over , but no one else knows that . ”
9521	9528	9504	9504	he	344	“ All right . What time ? ”
9529	9534	9504	9504	he	344	“ Eight - ish . ”
9558	9561	9562	9562	Arash	0	“ Great . ”
9565	9572	9562	9562	Arash	0	“ See you at the meeting . ”
9625	9628	9630	9631	my mother	319	“ Gideon . ”
9646	9667	9641	9641	Scott	303	“ Are you sure I ca n’t get you something , Mrs. Vidal ? Coffee , maybe ? Or water ? ”
9673	9683	9668	9668	She	319	“ No , thank you . I ’m fine . ”
9684	9688	9689	9689	He	303	“ All right . ”
9800	9812	9813	9813	She	319	“ Hello , Mother . What brings you into the city ? ”
9824	9832	9813	9813	She	319	“ Why is Eva wearing my ring ? ”
9845	9875	9836	9836	I	46	“ It ’s my ring . And the answer to your question is obvious : She ’s wearing the ring because I gave it to her when I proposed . ”
9876	9879	9880	9880	She	319	“ Gideon . ”
9886	9899	9880	9880	She	319	“ You do n’t know what you ’re getting into with her . ”
9929	9950	9918	9918	her	319	“ I do n’t have time for this . I ’ve put an important meeting on hold to see you . ”
9951	9975	9976	9976	Her	319	“ I would n’t have to come to your office if you ’d answer my calls or come home once in a while ! ”
9984	9991	9918	9918	her	319	“ That is not my home . ”
9992	10000	9976	9976	Her	319	“ She ’s using you , Gideon . ”
10006	10013	10001	10001	I	46	“ We ’ve had this discussion . ”
10036	10073	10030	10030	she	319	“ She ’s involved with that singer , Brett Kline . Did you know that ? And she ’s got an ugly side you ’ve never seen . She was downright vicious to me last night . ”
10074	10081	10083	10083	my	46	“ I ’ll speak with her . ”
10099	10108	10093	10093	I	46	“ She should n’t be wasting her time . ”
10115	10123	10109	10110	My mother	319	“ I ’m trying to help you . ”
10124	10139	10093	10093	I	46	“ It ’s a little too late for that , do n’t you think ? ”
10153	10180	10140	10140	She	319	“ I know Geoffrey ’s death was hard on you . It was a difficult time for all of us . I tried to give you — ”
10181	10189	10190	10190	I	46	“ I ’m not doing this here ! ”
10221	10255	10213	10213	she	319	“ You ’ve hijacked my morning and pissed me off . Let me make it clear to you . There is no scenario pitting you against Eva where you come out on top . ”
10256	10264	10195	10195	she	319	“ You ’re not listening to me ! ”
10265	10303	10213	10213	she	319	“ There ’s nothing you could say that would affect anything . If she wanted my money , I ’d give her every cent . If she wanted another man , I ’d make her forget him . ”
10326	10370	10304	10304	She	354	“ I only want the best for you , and she ’s stirring up crap that has been put away a long time . It ca n’t be a healthy relationship for you . She ’s creating a rift with your family that — ”
10371	10387	10429	10430	Patek Philippe	88	“ We ’ve been estranged , Mother . Eva has nothing to do with that . ”
10388	10399	10403	10403	she	354	“ I do n’t want it to be like this ! ”
10461	10470	10447	10447	she	354	“ I miss you . I love you . ”
10471	10475	10447	10447	she	354	“ Not enough . ”
10476	10492	10447	10447	she	354	“ That ’s not fair , Gideon . You wo n’t give me a chance . ”
10493	10506	10507	10507	I	46	“ If you need a ride , Angus is at your service . ”
10517	10548	10507	10507	I	46	“ Do n’t come here again , Mother . I do n’t like arguing with you . It would be best for both of us if you just stay away . ”
10563	10570	10507	10507	I	46	“ YOU took this shot today ? ”
10612	10615	10616	10616	he	46	“ Yes , ”
10619	10627	10616	10616	he	46	“ Not more than an hour ago . ”
10697	10706	10707	10707	I	46	“ Eva said the woman had long hair , ”
10761	10768	10753	10753	I	46	“ Find out who it was . ”
10769	10773	10753	10753	I	46	“ Will do . ”
10774	10780	10753	10753	I	46	“ Did Eva call you ? ”
10784	10787	10781	10781	He	46	“ No . ”
10798	10801	10802	10802	he	46	“ No , ”
10806	10828	10753	10753	I	46	“ She may wait until you fly out to San Diego . She wants you to find a friend of hers . ”
10829	10840	10802	10802	he	46	“ No problem . I ’ll take care of it . ”
10841	10847	10848	10848	I	46	“ Take care of her , ”
10855	10863	10802	10802	he	46	“ Does n’t need to be said . ”
10864	10871	10848	10848	I	46	“ I know . Thank you . ”
10962	10970	10971	10971	Scott	303	“ The team from Envoy is here , ”
10977	10982	10971	10971	Scott	303	“ Send them in . ”
11140	11147	11148	11148	she	49	“ I ’m so fucking excited ! ”
11162	11167	11135	11135	she	49	“ Watch the mouth . ”
11168	11211	11135	11135	she	49	“ Are you kidding ? I ’m seventeen , not seven . This is so awesome . I ’ve wanted a sister forever , but figured I ’d be old and gray before you and Christopher stopped bouncing around and settled down . ”
11219	11225	11212	11212	I	46	“ I live to serve . ”
11226	11245	11135	11135	she	49	“ Ha . Yeah , right . You done good , you know . Eva ’s a keeper . ”
11246	11252	11212	11212	I	46	“ Yes , I know . ”
11253	11272	11135	11135	she	49	“ Thanks to her , I get to harass you now . Always a highlight of my day . ”
11294	11307	11284	11284	I	46	“ Oddly enough , it ’s a highlight of mine as well . ”
11308	11317	11318	11318	Her	366	“ Well , yeah . It should be . ”
11322	11364	11318	11318	Her	366	“ I heard Mom losing her shit over it earlier . She told Dad she went to your work and you guys got in a fight or something . I think she ’s kinda jealous . She ’ll get over it . ”
11365	11376	11284	11284	I	46	“ Do n’t worry about it . Everything ’s fine . ”
11377	11408	11318	11318	Her	366	“ I know . It just sucks that she could n’t keep it together today of all days . Anyway , I ’m thrilled and wanted you to know that . ”
11409	11413	11284	11284	I	46	“ Thank you . ”
11414	11453	11318	11318	Her	366	“ But I ’m not going to be the flower girl . I ’m too old for that . I ’m up for being a bridesmaid , though . Even a groomswoman or whatever . Just sayin ’ . ”
11454	11458	11284	11284	I	46	“ All right . ”
11463	11472	11284	11284	I	46	“ I ’ll pass that along to Eva . ”
11486	11492	11493	11493	he	303	“ Miss Tramell is here , ”
11507	11527	11493	11493	he	303	“ And , as a reminder , your videoconference with the development team in California is in five minutes . ”
11620	11630	11631	11631	I	46	“ Send along the proposal deck to the team , ”
11635	11647	11631	11631	I	46	“ Tell them to review and I ’ll join in shortly . ”
11648	11653	11674	11674	She	49	“ Yes , sir . ”
11660	11663	11664	11664	I	46	“ Eva . ”
11667	11673	11664	11664	I	46	“ How was your day ? ”
11696	11702	11703	11703	she	49	“ I fucking love you , ”
12031	12038	12039	12039	I	46	“ You ’ll make me come , ”
12093	12099	12084	12084	She	252	“ I do n’t mind . ”
12100	12116	12084	12084	She	252	“ I would n’t , either , if I did n’t have a meeting waiting . ”
12117	12141	12084	12084	She	252	“ I do n’t want to hold you up . I just want to thank you for what you said to my dad . ”
12154	12166	12144	12144	I	46	“ My lawyer said I ’d score major points for that . ”
12167	12202	12203	12203	She	252	“ Work was so busy , and I did n’t have a chance to call him until lunch . I was so worried he ’d hear about our engagement before I could tell him . ”
12209	12228	12203	12203	She	252	“ You could ’ve given me a heads - up that you were announcing it to the world ! ”
12232	12249	12229	12229	I	46	“ It was n’t planned , but I was n’t going to deny it when asked . ”
12255	12271	12250	12250	Her	252	“ Of course not . Did you see that ridiculous post about a baby bump ? ”
12272	12280	12281	12281	I	46	“ A frightening thought at this point , ”
12299	12313	12281	12281	I	46	“ I ’m planning on keeping you all to myself for a while . ”
12314	12320	12321	12321	She	252	“ I know , right ? ”
12326	12373	12321	12321	She	252	“ I was freaked out that my dad would think I was engaged and pregnant , and just could n’t be bothered to let him know . It was such a relief to call him and find out you ’d explained everything and smoothed the way . ”
12374	12378	12379	12379	I	46	“ My pleasure . ”
12425	12440	12441	12441	she	252	“ I have n’t even left yet , and I ’m missing you already , ”
12449	12454	12441	12441	she	252	“ Do n’t go . ”
12455	12483	12484	12484	She	252	“ If I were just going to hole up with Cary for a bit , I ’d do it here at home and not in San Diego . ”
12492	12518	12484	12484	She	252	“ But he ’s a head case over Tatiana being pregnant . Plus , I need to spend time with my dad . Especially now . ”
12519	12529	12441	12441	she	252	“ Is there something you should be telling me ? ”
12530	12571	12484	12484	She	252	“ No . He sounded good when I talked to him , but I think he was hoping we ’d have more time together before I got married . To him , it seems like you and I just met . ”
12586	12594	12574	12574	I	46	“ And we ca n’t forget Kline . ”
12613	12627	12599	12599	She	370	“ I ’m leaving soon . I do n’t want to fight again . ”
12633	12640	12628	12628	I	46	“ Eva . Look at me . ”
12681	12699	12675	12675	I	46	“ You still do n’t understand what you do to me . How crazy you make me . ”
12700	12719	12665	12665	She	370	“ Do n’t give me that . You should n’t have brought up Corinne the way you did . ”
12720	12742	12675	12675	I	46	“ Maybe not . But be honest , you brought up Kline this morning because you ’re worried about seeing him . ”
12743	12749	12665	12665	She	370	“ I ’m not worried ! ”
12750	12753	12754	12754	I	46	“ Angel . ”
12761	12831	12754	12754	I	46	“ You ’re worried . I do n’t think you ’d sleep with him , but I do think you ’re anxious about crossing a line you should n’t . You needed a strong reaction from me , so you were blunt and you got it . You needed to see what it would do to me . How just the thought of you with him makes me insane . ”
12832	12835	12836	12836	She	370	“ Gideon . ”
12841	12848	12836	12836	She	370	“ Nothing is going to happen . ”
12849	12856	12857	12857	I	46	“ I ’m not making excuses . ”
12865	12874	12857	12857	I	46	“ I hurt you and I ’m sorry . ”
12875	12894	12857	12857	I	46	“ I ’m sorry , too . I wanted to avoid causing any problems and they happened anyway . ”
12910	12935	12902	12902	I	46	“ We ’re learning as we go . We ’ll fuck up now and again . You just have to trust me , angel . ”
12936	12965	12966	12966	She	370	“ I have , Gideon . It ’s why we ’ve gotten so far . But the fact that you ’d hurt me at all — on purpose … ”
12984	13003	12966	12966	She	370	“ You were always supposed to be the one I could count on to never hurt me deliberately . ”
13062	13078	13079	13079	I	46	“ There ’s a difference between deliberation and malicious intent , would n’t you agree ? ”
13087	13121	13079	13079	I	46	“ I promise I ’ll never cause you pain just to hurt you . Do n’t you see that I ’m just as vulnerable ? You have the same power to hurt me . ”
13131	13136	13122	13122	Her	370	“ I would n’t . ”
13137	13149	13079	13079	I	46	“ But I did . You ’ll have to forgive me . ”
13154	13165	13150	13150	She	370	“ I hate when you use that tone of voice . ”
13183	13190	13172	13172	I	46	“ But it makes you wet . ”
13297	13309	13310	13310	she	370	“ Do n’t try to control me with sex , Gideon , ”
13318	13329	13310	13310	she	370	“ I do n’t want to control you at all . ”
13330	13352	13310	13310	she	370	“ You manipulate me . You do things … say things … just to get a particular response out of me . ”
13363	13373	13357	13357	I	46	“ As do you , which we just discussed . ”
13378	13389	13374	13374	She	370	“ I ’m allowed to , I ’m a woman . ”
13390	13393	13394	13394	I	46	“ Ah . ”
13398	13403	13394	13394	I	46	“ I knew that . ”
13404	13413	13414	13414	She	370	“ You ’re such an enigma to me . ”
13427	13447	13414	13414	She	370	“ But you ’ve got me pegged . You know all my buttons and just how to push them . ”
13448	13493	13420	13420	her	370	“ If you think I do n’t spend a good percentage of every day trying to figure you out , you ’re not paying attention . Think about that while I handle this meeting , and then we ’ll say good - bye properly . ”
13580	13591	13592	13592	she	370	“ Watching you get into business mode makes me hot , ”
13609	13614	13592	13592	she	370	“ Sexy as hell . ”
13620	13628	13615	13615	My	46	“ Angel , behave for fifteen minutes . ”
13629	13645	13592	13592	she	370	“ What would be the fun in that ? Besides , you like me bad . ”
13649	13653	13654	13654	I	46	“ Fifteen minutes , ”
13677	13685	13686	13686	Eva	49	“ Do what you have to do . ”
13704	13724	13686	13686	Eva	49	“ I ’ll find something to occupy myself with while you ’re on the phone playing with your millions . ”
13899	13912	13893	13893	Eva	49	“ Good . It ’ll go easier on you if you cooperate . ”
13913	13941	13945	13948	the team in California	378	“ You do n’t actually believe having your mouth wrapped around my dick while I ’m on a videoconference is going to be easy at any level . ”
14091	14105	14085	14085	Her	49	“ If you liked things easy , you would n’t have married me . ”
14408	14411	14412	14412	I	46	“ Fuck , ”
14494	14499	14486	14486	I	46	“ Excuse the delay , ”
14510	14538	14504	14504	Eva	49	“ Now that you ’ve had the chance to review the deck , let ’s discuss the steps you ’ll be taking to implement the recommended adjustments . ”
14641	14651	14652	14652	he	386	“ I ’d like more time to review this , ”
14655	14706	14652	14652	he	386	“ but off the cuff , I ’m thinking this is a seriously accelerated schedule . Some of this is great and I ’m excited about seeing what we can do with it , but phasing into consumer beta testing is at least a year away , not six months . ”
14707	14718	14719	14719	I	46	“ That ’s what you told me six months ago , ”
14758	14767	14747	14747	she	49	“ We lost our top designer to LanCorp — ”
14768	14779	14747	14747	she	49	“ And I offered a replacement , which you declined . ”
14827	14836	14837	14837	he	93	“ A creative team is a delicate balance , ”
14840	14864	14837	14837	he	93	“ You ca n’t just plug a random person into the void . We ’ve got the right man on the job now — ”
14865	14869	14870	14871	Jeff Simmons	94	“ Thank you , ”
14885	14893	14894	14894	Tim	93	“ — and we ’re making progress , ”
14898	14901	14894	14894	Tim	93	“ We — ”
14902	14913	14914	14914	My	46	“ — keep blowing through your self - imposed deadlines . ”
14990	15000	15001	15001	he	94	“ While creating an exceptional and groundbreaking user experience , ”
15005	15019	15001	15001	he	94	“ We ’re getting the job done and we ’re doing it right . ”
15047	15078	14987	14987	her	252	“ Excellent . Now , you just need to do it faster . I ’m sending out a team to help you achieve the objectives on time . They ’ll — ”
15079	15088	15089	15089	Henderson	93	“ Now , wait a minute , Cross , ”
15098	15142	15089	15089	Henderson	93	“ You send some corporate bean counters over to breathe down our necks and you ’re only going to slow us down ! You need to leave the development to us . If we need your help , we ’ll ask for it . ”
15143	15166	14987	14987	her	252	“ If you thought I ’d give you my money and be a silent partner , you did n’t do your homework . ”
15167	15172	15173	15173	Eva	49	“ Uh - oh , ”
15197	15247	15185	15185	I	46	“ The app space is highly competitive . That ’s why you approached me . You presented me with a unique and intriguing gaming concept , and a one - year development - to - rollout timeline , which was judged by my team to be reasonable and achievable . ”
15303	15317	15318	15319	Ken Harada	95	“ You ’re looking at this from the wrong perspective , Mr. Cross , ”
15330	15349	15318	15319	Ken Harada	95	“ Technical timelines do n’t make allowances for an organic creative process . You do n’t understand how — ”
15350	15359	15318	15319	Ken Harada	95	“ Do n’t make me the villain here . ”
15390	15427	15428	15429	The artist	389	“ You guaranteed on - time delivery of all elements on a schedule you created and you ’re not holding up your end . I ’m now forced to help you keep the promises you made . ”
15478	15512	15476	15476	me	46	“ This is how this is going to play out . You ’ll work with the team I ’m sending . If you miss another deadline , I ’m pulling Tim off oversight . ”
15513	15516	15517	15517	he	389	“ Bullshit ! ”
15520	15535	15517	15517	he	389	“ This is my fucking app ! You ca n’t take it from me . ”
15553	15576	15543	15543	my	46	“ You should ’ve read the contract more carefully . Do that tonight and we ’ll revisit tomorrow after the team arrives . ”
15786	15797	15798	15798	I	46	“ My admin will call you in a few minutes , ”
15806	15826	15798	15798	I	46	“ to arrange tomorrow ’s meeting . I hope we can come to an amicable agreement . Until then . ”
15838	15844	15827	15827	I	46	“ Come here , angel . ”
15868	15874	15875	15875	she	252	“ You ’re a machine ! ”
15891	15908	15875	15875	she	252	“ I ca n’t believe you did n’t even twitch ! How can you — Oh ! ”
15925	15931	15932	15932	she	252	“ I liked those panties , ”
15957	15964	15937	15937	her	252	“ You ’ll like this more . ”
15965	15968	15939	15939	I	46	“ ANGEL . ”
15987	15990	15974	15974	Eva	49	“ Hmm ? ”
16003	16010	15991	15991	I	46	“ I assume you ’re okay . ”
16011	16015	16016	16016	She	252	“ Never better . ”
16027	16051	16016	16016	She	252	“ Missing the brain you just fucked out of me , but otherwise , I ’m feeling excellent , thank you very much . ”
16052	16057	16058	16058	I	46	“ You ’re welcome . ”
16068	16085	16016	16016	She	252	“ Are you trying to set a new record for most orgasms in a single day ? ”
16086	16100	16016	16016	She	252	“ An intriguing proposition . I ’m willing to give it a shot . ”
16113	16133	16101	16101	She	252	“ No more , maniac . You screw me again and I ’ll be a drooling , babbling idiot . ”
16134	16144	16145	16145	I	46	“ Let me know if you change your mind . ”
16188	16199	16178	16178	her	252	“ Do n’t work too hard this weekend , okay ? ”
16200	16213	16214	16214	I	46	“ As if there ’s something else worth doing without you around , ”
16217	16229	16178	16178	her	252	“ Sleep in . Read a book . Plan a party . ”
16234	16247	16230	16230	My	46	“ I have n’t forgotten . I ’m asking the guys tonight . ”
16248	16251	16178	16178	her	252	“ Oh ? ”
16266	16270	16258	16258	I	46	“ What guys ? ”
16271	16279	16178	16178	her	252	“ The ones you want to meet . ”
16280	16285	16258	16258	I	46	“ You ’re calling them ?
16289	16295	16286	16286	I	46	“ We ’re getting together . ”
16296	16301	16178	16178	her	252	“ To do what ? ”
16302	16308	16286	16286	I	46	“ Drink . Hang out . ”
16330	16335	16326	16326	Eva	49	“ At a club ? ”
16336	16342	16178	16178	her	252	“ Maybe . Probably not . ”
16353	16360	16343	16343	She	49	“ Are any of them married ? ”
16361	16364	16365	16365	I	46	“ Yes . ”
16375	16378	16365	16365	I	46	“ Me . ”
16379	16391	16343	16343	She	49	“ That ’s it ? Is Arnoldo going to be there ? ”
16392	16397	16365	16365	I	46	“ Maybe . Likely . ”
16398	16407	16343	16343	She	49	“ What ’s up with the short answers ? ”
16408	16416	16417	16417	I	46	“ What ’s up with the interrogation ? ”
16458	16473	16448	16448	She	252	“ I just want to know what you ’re doing , that ’s all . ”
16474	16483	16448	16448	She	252	“ I ’ll stay home if you will . ”
16484	16494	16448	16448	She	252	“ I ’m not asking you to do that . ”
16526	16534	16520	16521	No woman	397	“ Get to the point , then . ”
16541	16554	16535	16535	She	252	“ Why wo n’t you tell me what you guys have planned ? ”
16555	16582	16535	16535	She	252	“ I do n’t know , Eva . Usually we meet at one of our places and drink . Play cards . Sometimes we go out . ”
16583	16602	16535	16535	She	252	“ Trolling . A group of hot guys who ’ve got a buzz and want a good time . ”
16603	16617	16535	16535	She	252	“ That ’s not a crime . And who said they ’re attractive ? ”
16624	16653	16618	16618	She	252	“ They ’re trolling with you . That means they ’re either hot enough not to completely pale in your shadow or too confident to worry about it . ”
16682	16686	16672	16672	I	46	“ Remember this ? ”
16687	16695	16696	16696	she	252	“ I ’m not worried about you , ”
16706	16719	16696	16696	she	252	“ If I ’m not fucking you enough , you need help . ”
16720	16731	16672	16672	I	46	“ Says the wife who could n’t wait fifteen minutes . ”
16740	16750	16696	16696	she	252	“ That ’s what got you fucked right there . ”
16751	16769	16696	16696	she	252	“ Arnoldo does n’t trust me , Gideon . He does n’t really want you with me . ”
16770	16801	16696	16696	she	252	“ It ’s not his decision to make . And some of your friends are n’t going to like me , either . I know Cary ’s on the fence . ”
16802	16815	16696	16696	she	252	“ What if Arnoldo tells the others how he feels about me ? ”
16816	16819	16820	16820	I	46	“ Angel . ”
16831	16840	16820	16820	I	46	“ Talking about feelings is predominantly female territory . ”
16841	16847	16696	16696	she	252	“ Do n’t be sexist . ”
16848	16870	16820	16820	I	46	“ You know I ’m right . Besides , Arnoldo knows how it is . He ’s been in love before . ”
16882	16891	16871	16871	She	399	“ Are you in love , Mr. Cross ? ”
16892	16895	16896	16897	MANUEL Alcoa	99	“ Irrevocably . ”
16908	16919	16904	16904	he	99	“ You just cost me a thousand dollars , Cross . ”
16978	16982	16983	16983	I	46	“ How so ? ”
16994	17015	17016	17016	Manuel	100	“ You are the last man I figured would tie the knot and you turn out to be the first . ”
17021	17025	17016	17016	Manuel	100	“ Kills me . ”
17031	17037	17026	17026	I	46	“ You bet against me ? ”
17038	17050	17051	17053	The portfolio manager	402	“ Yeah . Although I suspect someone had the inside scoop . ”
17072	17079	17080	17080	I	46	“ If it ’s any consolation , ”
17083	17093	17080	17080	I	46	“ I ’d have bet against me , too . ”
17097	17122	17123	17123	He	100	“ Latinas rule , my friend . Sexy , curvy . More than a handful in bed and out . Hot tempered . Passionate . ”
17126	17130	17094	17094	Manuel	100	“ Good choice . ”
17131	17134	17135	17135	Arash	0	“ Manuel ! ”
17142	17149	17135	17135	Arash	0	“ Bring those limes over here . ”
17204	17209	17200	17200	I	46	“ How are you ? ”
17210	17213	17214	17214	His	97	“ Good . ”
17227	17244	17214	17214	His	97	“ I ’d ask you the same , but you look well . I ’m glad . ”
17254	17266	17245	17245	I	46	“ Eva worries that you ’ve got a problem with her . ”
17272	17282	17267	17267	He	97	“ I ’ve never been disrespectful to your woman . ”
17283	17290	17214	17214	His	97	“ She never said you were . ”
17306	17322	17291	17291	Arnoldo	97	“ I understand that you are — what ’s the word?—held captive by this woman . ”
17323	17326	17327	17327	I	46	“ Captivated , ”
17340	17345	17346	17346	He	97	“ Ah , yes . ”
17353	17372	17346	17346	He	97	“ I have been there , my friend , as you know . I do n’t judge you . ”
17505	17511	17476	17476	she	49	“ Voglio che sia felice . ”
17532	17542	17543	17543	he	97	“ If her happiness depends on what I think , ”
17548	17594	17543	17543	he	97	“ you ask too much . I will never say anything against her . I ’ll always treat her with the respect I feel for you as long as you are together . But what I believe is my choice and my right , Gideon . ”
17643	17650	17651	17651	I	46	“ Our relationship is … complex , ”
17655	17672	17651	17651	I	46	“ I ’ve hurt her as much as she ’s ever hurt me — likely more . ”
17673	17687	17688	17688	Arnoldo	97	“ I ’m not surprised to hear that , but I am sorry . ”
17692	17726	17688	17688	Arnoldo	97	“ You could n’t choose one of the other women who ’ve loved you and would give you no trouble ? A comfortable ornament who would settle into your life without a ripple ? ”
17727	17740	17741	17741	My	46	“ As Eva says , what would be the fun in that ? ”
17745	17778	17741	17741	My	46	“ She challenges me , Arnoldo . Makes me see things … think about things , in ways I did n’t before . And she loves me . Not like the others . ”
17786	17797	17688	17688	Arnoldo	97	“ You did n’t allow the others to love you . ”
17798	17809	17817	17817	I	46	“ I could n’t . I was waiting for her . ”
17820	17832	17817	17817	I	46	“ I ca n’t imagine your Bianca was hassle - free . ”
17836	17850	17833	17833	He	46	“ No . But my life is simple . I can use complications . ”
17851	17864	17865	17865	Arnoldo	97	“ My life was ordered . Now , it ’s an adventure . ”
17874	17889	17865	17865	Arnoldo	97	“ But that wildness in her that you love is what worries me most . ”
17890	17894	17833	17833	He	46	“ Stop worrying . ”
17895	17929	17865	17865	Arnoldo	97	“ I will mention this only once , then never again . You may be angry with me for what I say , but understand that my heart is in the right place . ”
17934	17941	17930	17930	My	46	“ Get it off your chest . ”
17942	17997	17833	17833	He	46	“ I sat with Eva and Brett Kline at dinner . I observed them together . There is chemistry there , not unlike what I saw between Bianca and the man she left me for . I wish I believed Eva would ignore it , but she ’s already proven that she ca n’t . ”
18003	18014	17998	17998	I	46	“ She had her reasons . Reasons I gave her . ”
18020	18034	18015	18015	Arnoldo	97	“ Then I ’ll pray that you do n’t give her more reasons . ”
18035	18038	18039	18039	Arash	0	“ Hey , ”
18042	18056	18039	18039	Arash	0	“ Cut it out with the Italian and get your asses in here . ”
18091	18101	18102	18102	Cary	483	“ WHAT ’S GOT YOU frowning , baby girl ? ”
18295	18307	18308	18308	I	46	“ I ’m trying to set up some social media accounts , ”
18311	18314	18315	18315	He	483	“ Whoa . ”
18329	18333	18315	18315	He	483	“ Big step . ”
18334	18337	18338	18338	Nathan	310	“ Yeah . ”
18361	18379	18338	18338	Nathan	310	“ But it ’s time . I feel like … Never mind . It ’s just time . ”
18380	18384	18385	18385	He	483	“ All right . ”
18398	18410	18385	18385	He	483	“ Then why is your face all scrunched up like that ? ”
18411	18449	18390	18390	his	483	“ Well , there ’s a lot to consider . I mean , how much do I share out there ? I do n’t have to worry about Nathan anymore , but Gideon is under constant scrutiny . ”
18644	18649	18650	18650	I	46	“ I ’m married , ”
18668	18683	18650	18650	I	46	“ To Gideon , of course . Who else would I be married to ? ”
18690	18694	18684	18684	Cary	483	“ Come again ? ”
18732	18743	18723	18723	I	46	“ When we went away last weekend . We eloped . ”
18761	18767	18755	18755	he	483	“ Are you shitting me ? ”
18811	18818	18819	18819	Cary	483	“ What ’s the damned rush ? ”
18822	18828	18829	18829	I	46	“ It just … happened . ”
18905	18911	18890	18890	My	46	“ I ’m not sorry . ”
18912	18916	18917	18917	Cary	483	“ Not yet . ”
18925	18946	18917	18917	Cary	483	“ Jesus , Eva . You do n’t up and marry the first guy you have a serious relationship with . ”
18947	18954	18955	18955	I	46	“ It ’s not like that , ”
18964	18974	18955	18955	I	46	“ You know how we feel about each other . ”
18975	18994	18917	18917	Cary	483	“ Sure . You two are whack jobs separately . Together , you ’re a goddamn nut house . ”
19001	19020	18995	18995	I	46	“ We ’ll work on it . Wearing a ring does n’t mean we stop figuring things out . ”
19030	19063	19021	19021	He	483	“ What incentive has he got to fix anything ? He ’s bagged and tagged the prize . You ’re stuck with his psychotic dreams and Grand Canyon – sized mood swings . ”
19064	19069	19070	19070	I	46	“ Wait a minute , ”
19083	19097	19070	19070	I	46	“ You did n’t get upset when I told you we were engaged . ”
19098	19140	19021	19021	He	483	“ Because I figured it ’d be a year , at the very least , before Monica got the wedding worked out . Maybe a year and a half . At least some time for you two to try living together . ”
19176	19235	19167	19167	He	483	“ I ’m having a baby and I ’m not getting married . You know why ? Because I ’m too fucked up and I know it . I ’ve got no business hitching a passenger on this wild ride . If he loved you , he ’d be thinking about you and what ’s best for you . ”
19236	19254	19262	19262	they	429	“ I ’m so glad you ’re happy for me , Cary . That means a lot . ”
19499	19502	19503	19503	Cary	483	“ Fuck . ”
19509	19517	19503	19503	Cary	483	“ Make me feel like an ass . ”
19518	19524	19525	19525	I	46	“ If the shoe fits … ”
19684	19692	19693	19693	Cary	483	“ Am I the last to know ? ”
19696	19703	19704	19704	I	46	“ You ’re the only one . ”
19709	19733	19704	19704	I	46	“ At least on my side . Gideon wants to tell the world , but we ’re going to keep it under wraps . ”
19738	19743	19734	19734	He	483	“ For how long ? ”
19744	19764	19734	19734	He	483	“ Forever . The next wedding we have will be our first as far as anyone else is concerned . ”
19765	19771	19734	19734	He	483	“ You having second thoughts ? ”
19815	19831	19805	19805	Raúl	46	“ No . I ’m glad we ’re married . I love him , Cary . ”
19850	19856	19857	19857	Cary	483	“ I know you do , ”
20238	20246	20247	20247	I	46	“ It ’s all good , Cary , ”
20251	20256	20247	20247	I	46	“ Do n’t worry . ”
20257	20271	20272	20272	He	483	“ I ’d be more worried if I thought you actually believed that . ”
20284	20292	20272	20272	He	483	“ It ’s too soon , Eva . ”
20296	20303	20293	20293	I	46	“ But it ’ll work out . ”
20555	20564	20565	20565	Cary	483	“ SoCAL , baby , I missed you . ”
20588	20602	20565	20565	Cary	483	“ God , it ’s good to leave that East Coast humidity behind . ”
20653	20656	20657	20657	I	46	“ Dad ! ”
20707	20717	20718	20718	he	71	“ It ’s good to see you , baby , ”
20734	20737	20738	20739	My dad	339	“ Cary . ”
20761	20767	20738	20739	My dad	339	“ Looking good , kid . ”
20768	20772	20738	20739	My dad	339	“ I try . ”
20773	20777	20778	20779	my dad	339	“ Got everything ? ”
20829	20832	20833	20833	Cary	483	“ Yep , ”
20886	20891	20892	20893	My dad	483	“ You two hungry ? ”
20939	20942	20931	20931	Cary	483	“ Starved . ”
20946	20952	20943	20943	I	46	“ You ’re always hungry . ”
20953	20961	20962	20962	he	483	“ So are you , sweet cheeks , ”
20982	20992	20962	20962	he	483	“ I ’ve just got no guilt about it . ”
21165	21183	21184	21184	Cary	483	“ What about that place in Oceanside with the slushy beer and peanut shells on the floor ? ”
21187	21190	21191	21191	I	46	“ Yeah . ”
21203	21209	21191	21191	I	46	“ That ’d be fun . ”
21238	21243	21229	21229	I	46	“ You got it . ”
21321	21323	21292	21292	they	462	“ Golden ”
21375	21379	21380	21380	I	46	“ Good morning , ”
21399	21405	21380	21380	I	46	“ Did you sleep well ? ”
21406	21410	21416	21416	his	339	“ Well enough . ”
21423	21435	21416	21416	his	339	“ Raúl says Victor ’s coffee could wake a hibernating bear . ”
21496	21511	21487	21487	I	46	“ Are you trying to intimidate me with how closely you ’re watching me ? ”
21512	21527	21533	21533	I	46	“ If intimidation were my goal , I would n’t be subtle about it . ”
21551	21571	21533	21533	I	46	“ You do know that tone of voice makes me want to irritate you back , do n’t you ? ”
21572	21584	21585	21585	he	483	“ Because you like the way I rise to the challenge , ”
21607	21621	21603	21603	My	46	“ So , what exactly did you guys end up doing last night ? ”
21622	21635	21533	21533	I	46	“ The usual . Drink . Give each other a hard time . ”
21636	21642	21603	21603	My	46	“ Did you go out ? ”
21643	21650	21533	21533	I	46	“ For a couple of hours . ”
21670	21677	21658	21658	I	46	“ I hope you had fun . ”
21678	21692	21603	21603	My	46	“ It was n’t bad . Tell me your plans for the day . ”
21720	21756	21693	21693	I	46	“ When Cary wakes up and rolls his ass off the couch , we ’ll grab a quick lunch with my dad . Then we ’re going down to San Diego to see Dr. Travis . ”
21757	21761	21702	21702	his	483	“ And tonight ? ”
21784	21853	21778	21778	he	483	“ The band ’s manager sent me an e - mail about where to claim VIP tickets , but I ’ve decided not to see the show . I figure Cary can take a friend , if he wants . What I have to say wo n’t take very long , so either I ’ll see Brett tomorrow before I leave or we can chat on the phone . ”
21858	21874	21854	21854	He	483	“ I expect you have an idea of what you ’re going to tell him . ”
21875	21933	21854	21854	He	483	“ I ’m gon na keep it simple . With ‘ Golden ’ and my engagement , I do n’t think it ’s appropriate for us to see each other socially . I hope we ’ll be friends and keep in touch , but e - mail and texts are better , unless you ’re with me . ”
21948	21951	21934	21934	He	483	“ Gideon ? ”
21952	21965	21854	21854	He	483	“ I need to know if you ’re afraid to see him . ”
21985	21995	21979	21979	I	46	“ I do n’t want to fight about Brett . ”
21996	22005	21934	21934	He	483	“ So your solution is to avoid him . ”
22006	22029	21979	21979	I	46	“ You and I have enough shit to fight about without throwing him into the mix . He ’s not worth it . ”
22055	22064	22044	22044	his	483	“ I can live with that , Eva . ”
22143	22150	22151	22151	I	46	“ You ’re everything to me , ”
22154	22163	22151	22151	I	46	“ I think about you all the time . ”
22164	22172	22177	22177	I	46	“ It ’s no different for me . ”
22173	22176	22177	22177	I	46	“ Really ? ”
22189	22258	22177	22177	I	46	“ Because I have it so bad for you . I get — well , hot . Like I ’m overcome with this desperate need to be touching you . My brain scatters and I have to take a minute to ride it out , but it ’s so hard to deal . So many times I ’ve almost dropped whatever I ’m doing to get to you . ”
22259	22262	22177	22177	I	46	“ Eva — ”
22263	22303	22177	22177	I	46	“ I have fantasies about barging into one of your meetings and just running right into you . Have I told you that ? When the craving is really bad , I can almost feel you pulling at me . ”
22314	22376	22304	22304	I	46	“ I lose my breath every time I see you . If I close my eyes , I can hear your voice . I woke up this morning and I panicked a little because you ’re so far away . I would ’ve given anything to be able to get to you . I wanted to cry because I could n’t . ”
22377	22384	22177	22177	I	46	“ Christ . Eva , please — ”
22385	22437	22304	22304	I	46	“ If you ’re going to worry about anything , Gideon , it should be me . Because I ca n’t be rational when it comes to you . I ’m crazy about you . Literally . I ca n’t think about a future without you — it freaks me out . ”
22438	22472	22177	22177	I	46	“ Goddamn it . You ’ll never be without me . We ’re going to grow old together . Die together . I ’m not going to live a single day without you . ”
22488	22525	22483	22483	I	46	“ I need you to understand that you ’ll never have to settle for pieces of me . You should n’t be settling at all . You deserve so much better . You could have anyone — ”
22526	22531	22532	22532	I	46	“ That ’s enough ! ”
22541	22554	22555	22555	he	46	“ You will not ever say anything like that to me again , ”
22558	22572	22555	22555	he	46	“ Or I swear to God , angel , I will punish you . ”
22615	22621	22622	22622	I	46	“ I have to go , ”
22626	22681	22622	22622	I	46	“ Do n’t hang up . For God ’s sake , Eva , we ’re married . We ’re in love . There ’s no shame in that . So what if it ’s crazy ? It ’s us . It ’s who we are . You need to come to grips with that . ”
22701	22718	22694	22694	I	46	“ My dad ’s here , Gideon . I ’ll have to talk to you later . ”
22719	22725	22726	22726	he	339	“ You make me happy , ”
22742	22760	22726	22726	he	339	“ I ’d forgotten what that feels like . Do n’t devalue what you mean to me . ”
22763	22770	22771	22771	I	46	“ I love you , too . ”
22893	22899	22900	22900	he	339	“ I heard you talking , ”
22907	22910	22911	22911	My	46	“ Oh . ”
22939	22964	22927	22928	my dad	339	“ I was going to talk to you about whether you knew what you were doing , getting engaged so soon and so young . ”
22976	22982	22965	22965	I	46	“ I figured you would . ”
22983	22995	22996	22996	He	339	“ But now I think I understand what you ’re feeling . ”
23008	23045	22996	22996	He	339	“ You express it far better than I ever could , back in the day . The most I could ever get out was ‘ I love you , ’ and it ’s just not enough . ”
23072	23084	23056	23056	I	46	“ Gideon does n’t think those words are enough , either . ”
23133	23144	23127	23127	he	339	“ He shows me , though . All the time . ”
23145	23156	23157	23158	My dad	339	“ I ’ve talked to him a few times now . ”
23161	23174	23157	23158	My dad	339	“ I have to remind myself that he ’s in his twenties . ”
23180	23188	23177	23177	me	46	“ He ’s very self - possessed . ”
23189	23198	23157	23158	My dad	339	“ He ’s also very hard to read . ”
23203	23217	23199	23199	My	46	“ He ’s a poker player . But he means what he says . ”
23244	23253	23238	23238	he	339	“ And he wants to marry my daughter . ”
23260	23267	23254	23254	I	46	“ You gave him your blessing . ”
23268	23290	23291	23291	He	339	“ He said he would always take care of you . He promised to keep you safe and make you happy . ”
23300	23333	23291	23291	He	339	“ I still do n’t know why I believe him , even with him staking out my place for you . Does n’t help that he lied about waiting to ask you . ”
23334	23355	23254	23254	I	46	“ He could n’t wait , Dad . Do n’t hold it against him . He loves me too much . ”
23362	23376	23356	23356	He	339	“ You did n’t sound happy when you were just talking to him . ”
23377	23386	23387	23387	I	46	“ No . I sounded desperate and insecure . ”
23390	23417	23387	23387	I	46	“ I love him like mad , but I hate when I get needy with it . We should be balanced in our relationship . Equals . ”
23418	23436	23291	23291	He	339	“ Good goal . Do n’t lose sight of it . Does he want that , too ? ”
23437	23477	23387	23387	I	46	“ He wants us to be together . In everything . But he ’s built a reputation and an empire , and I want to build my own . Not necessarily the empire , but the reputation for sure . ”
23478	23487	23291	23291	He	339	“ Have you talked to him about this ? ”
23488	23492	23387	23387	I	46	“ Oh yeah . ”
23497	23517	23387	23387	I	46	“ But he believes Mrs. Cross should naturally play on Team Cross . And I can see his point . ”
23518	23532	23291	23291	He	339	“ It ’s good to hear that you ’ve been thinking this through . ”
23538	23541	23533	23533	I	46	“ But ? ”
23542	23555	23291	23291	He	339	“ But that could be a serious issue , could n’t it ? ”
23581	23614	23574	23574	He	339	“ Yes . I do n’t think it would become a deal breaker for us , but it could cause problems . He is n’t used to not getting what he wants . ”
23615	23623	23291	23291	He	339	“ Then you ’re good for him . ”
23624	23629	23630	23630	I	46	“ He thinks so . ”
23633	23717	23630	23630	I	46	“ Gideon is n’t the problem . It ’s me . He ’s been through a lot in his life and he ’s had to deal with it on his own . I do n’t want him to feel like he ’s got to handle everything himself anymore . I want him to feel like we ’re a unit and that I ’m here to support him . That ’s a hard message to send when I want my own independence , too . ”
23718	23726	23727	23727	he	499	“ You ’re a lot like me , ”
23744	23774	23778	23778	me	46	“ I know you ’ll get along with him . He ’s a good man , with a beautiful heart . He ’d do anything for me , Dad . ”
23815	23825	23826	23827	My dad	310	“ Would he let me pay for the wedding ? ”
23833	23852	23826	23827	My dad	310	“ I guess I should ask how much of a fight you think your mother would give me . ”
23853	23856	23857	23857	My	46	“ Dad … ”
23911	23923	23903	23904	my father	310	“ I do n’t know what to say except thank you . ”
23945	23960	23924	23924	He	310	“ I ’ve got about fifty large . I know it ’s not much — ”
23967	23972	23961	23961	I	46	“ It ’s perfect . ”
24012	24018	24019	24019	Cary	483	“ IT has n’t changed . ”
24046	24053	24037	24037	His	483	“ I ’ve missed this place . ”
24064	24069	24054	24054	I	46	“ Me , too . ”
24234	24239	24240	24240	Kyle	111	“ Oh my God . ”
24260	24270	24240	24240	Kyle	111	“ I did n’t know you two were back ! ”
24362	24374	24375	24375	he	55	“ I was n’t expecting you two until sometime after three , ”
24378	24387	24388	24388	Cary	483	“ It ’s after three in New York , ”
24498	24512	24477	24478	Dr. Travis	55	“ You two still watching each other ’s backs in the Big Apple ? ”
24513	24517	24518	24518	I	46	“ Of course , ”
24528	24540	24521	24521	Cary	483	“ She ’s getting married . I ’m having a baby . ”
24551	24554	24555	24555	he	483	“ Oww , ”
24566	24576	24562	24563	Dr. Travis	55	“ Congratulations . Quick work , both of you . ”
24577	24582	24583	24583	Kyle	111	“ I ’ll say , ”
24586	24595	24583	24583	Kyle	111	“ What ’s it been ? A month ? ”
24596	24599	24600	24601	Dr. Travis	55	“ Kyle . ”
24609	24617	24600	24601	Dr. Travis	55	“ Would you give us a minute ? ”
24626	24646	24618	24618	She	111	“ You ’re good , Doc , but I think you ’re going to need more time than that . ”
24647	24652	24653	24653	Kyle	111	“ ENGAGED , huh ? ”
24742	24755	24737	24737	Kyle	111	“ I always kinda figured you and Cary would end up together . ”
24763	24776	24756	24756	I	46	“ It ’s not like that with us . Never has been . ”
24798	24808	24780	24780	Her	111	“ You known this guy you ’re marrying long ? ”
24809	24813	24780	24780	Her	111	“ Long enough . ”
24846	24851	24852	24852	I	46	“ Catch you later , ”
24857	24861	24852	24852	I	46	“ Good luck . ”
24905	24916	24898	24898	we	521	“ You ever consider moving to New York , Doc ? ”
24923	24933	24917	24917	He	55	“ As if California taxes are n’t bad enough . ”
24938	24944	24934	24934	I	46	“ I had to try . ”
24957	24966	24945	24945	His	55	“ So did Cary . I ’m flattered . ”
25031	25038	25039	25039	he	55	“ Tell me about your fiancé , ”
25070	25074	25075	25075	I	46	“ Come on , ”
25078	25087	25075	25075	I	46	“ We both know Cary filled you in . ”
25109	25118	25119	25120	Dr. Travis	55	“ And I know who Gideon Cross is . ”
25137	25152	25119	25120	Dr. Travis	55	“ But I want to hear about the man you ’re going to marry . ”
25172	25221	25159	25159	he	55	“ Gideon is … God , he ’s so many things . He ’s complicated . We have some issues to work out , but we ’ll get there . My more immediate problem is the feelings I ’m having for this singer I used to … see . ”
25222	25226	25159	25159	he	55	“ Brett Kline ? ”
25227	25233	25159	25159	he	55	“ You remember his name . ”
25234	25247	25159	25159	he	55	“ Cary reminded me , but I remember our discussions about him . ”
25248	25253	25254	25254	I	46	“ Yeah , well . ”
25268	25310	25254	25254	I	46	“ I ’m so in love with Gideon . He ’s changed my life in so many ways . He makes me feel beautiful and precious . I know it seems too fast , but he ’s the one for me . ”
25315	25350	25311	25312	Dr. Travis	55	“ It was love at first sight for me and my wife . We were in high school when we met , but I knew she was the girl I was going to marry . ”
25410	25456	25679	25679	Fear	113	“ I do n’t understand why Brett has any effect on me at all . It ’s not that I want him . I ca n’t imagine being with anyone else but Gideon . Sexually or otherwise . But I ’m not indifferent to Brett . ”
25457	25463	25464	25464	he	55	“ Why should you be ? ”
25468	25496	25464	25464	he	55	“ He was a part of your life at a pivotal time , and the end of your relationship caused a bit of an epiphany for you . ”
25497	25514	25679	25679	Fear	113	“ My … interest — that ’s not the right word — doesn’t feel like nostalgia . ”
25515	25568	25464	25464	he	55	“ No , I ’m sure it does n’t . I would guess you ’re feeling some regret . Thinking about what - ifs . It was a highly sexual relationship for you , so there may be some lingering attraction , even if you know you ’d never go there again . ”
25589	25655	25579	25579	His	55	“ You said your fiancé is a complicated man and you ’re working on some issues . Brett was very simple . You knew what you were getting with him . In the last few months , you ’ve had a big move , you ’re closer to your mother , and you ’re engaged . You may , occasionally , wish things were simpler . ”
25665	25674	25656	25656	I	46	“ How do you make sense like that ? ”
25675	25678	25679	25679	Fear	113	“ Practice . ”
25684	25696	25679	25679	Fear	113	“ I do n’t want to screw things up with Gideon . ”
25697	25710	25656	25656	I	46	“ Do you have someone you ’re talking with in New York ? ”
25711	25718	25679	25679	Fear	113	“ We ’re in couples therapy . ”
25722	25741	25719	25719	He	55	“ Practical . That ’s good . He wants it to work , too . Does he know ? ”
25745	25748	25743	25743	Nathan	310	“ Yes . ”
25749	25758	25656	25656	I	46	“ I ’m proud of you , kiddo . ”
25759	25810	25743	25743	Nathan	310	“ I ’m going to avoid Brett , but I wonder if that means I ’m not dealing with the root of the problem . Like an alcoholic who does n’t drink is still an alcoholic . The problem is still there , they ’re just staying away from it . ”
25811	25858	25656	25656	I	46	“ Not quite true , but interesting that you ’d use an addiction analogy . You ’re prone to self - destructive behavior with men . A lot of individuals with your history are , so it ’s not unexpected and we ’ve addressed that before . ”
25859	25863	25743	25743	Nathan	310	“ I know . ”
25877	25888	25889	25889	he	46	“ There are a few things you have to consider , ”
25892	25940	25889	25889	he	46	“ You ’re engaged to a man who , on the surface , is very much the sort of man your mother would want for you . Considering how you feel about your mother ’s dependence on men , there might be some resistance you ’re feeling . ”
25952	25975	25945	25945	He	46	“ Ah , a possibility ? The other is that you might not feel you deserve what you ’ve found with him . ”
25983	25989	25945	25945	He	46	“ And I deserve Brett ? ”
25990	25993	25994	25994	He	46	“ Eva . ”
26001	26018	25994	25994	He	46	“ The fact you ’re even asking that question … that ’s your problem right there . ”
26020	26032	26033	26034	Sam Yimara	74	“ I DIDN’T EVEN recognize you without the suit and tie , ”
26340	26349	26328	26332	Only a handful of us	539	“ Have you decided to accept my offer ? ”
26350	26356	26357	26357	He	114	“ I ’ve considered it . ”
26384	26412	26357	26357	He	114	“ But hey , considering what you ’re valued at , I ’m surprised Eva ’s privacy is n’t worth more than a million dollars to you . ”
26417	26486	26413	26413	I	46	“ Eva ’s peace of mind is priceless to me . But if you think I ’ll up my offer , you are n’t thinking clearly . The injunction against you will go through . And then there ’s the pesky little detail regarding the legality of filming Eva without her consent , a very different scenario from a mutually agreed - upon private sex tape gone public . ”
26491	26535	26487	26487	His	114	“ I thought you wanted to keep this quiet , not make it part of public record . Eva would be on her own with any lawsuit , you know . I ’ve already talked to Brett and we ’ve worked things out . ”
26541	26548	26538	26538	my	46	“ He ’s seen the footage ? ”
26549	26554	26555	26555	Sam	74	“ He has it . ”
26567	26586	26555	26555	Sam	74	“ Here ’s a copy for Eva . I figured you should see what you ’re paying for . ”
26621	26679	26613	26613	My	46	“ It ’s going to come out that the footage exists ; I ca n’t stop it . You contacted too many reporters with your offer to sell it . What I can do is destroy you . Personally , that would be my preference . I want to watch you burn , you piece of shit . ”
26690	26753	26680	26680	Sam	74	“ You got more than Eva and Kline with your cameras . There are dozens of other victims who did n’t sign releases . I own this bar . Hell , I own the band . It did n’t take much effort to find the regulars and Six - Ninths followers who were here when you were illegally filming in the bathrooms . ”
26769	26775	26776	26776	I	46	“ If you were smarter , ”
26780	26825	26776	26776	I	46	“ you would ’ve leveraged for long - term gain instead of an immediate payout . Instead , you ’re going to sign the contract I ’m about to put in front of you and walk away with a check for a quarter million . ”
26829	26843	26826	26826	He	74	“ Fuck that ! You said one million . That was the deal . ”
26844	26851	26852	26852	I	46	“ Which you did n’t accept . ”
26855	26908	26852	26852	I	46	“ It ’s no longer on the table . And if you take any longer to decide , the new offer wo n’t be , either . I ’ll just run you into the ground and straight into a jail cell . It ’s enough that I can tell Eva I tried . ”
26963	26976	26977	26977	he	0	“ Always a pleasure watching you scare the hell out of someone , ”
27141	27143	27149	27150	your wife	546	“ friend ”
27190	27196	27197	27197	Arash	0	“ What was that sound ? ”
27221	27242	27197	27197	Arash	0	“ Was that a laugh , Cross ? Were you seriously just laughing ? Or were you having a stroke ? ”
27248	27251	27252	27252	he	0	“ Seriously ? ”
27256	27260	27252	27252	he	0	“ The finger ? ”
27261	27269	27286	27286	I	46	“ Eva says it ’s a classic . ”
27270	27285	27252	27252	he	0	“ Eva ’s hot enough to get away with it . You ’re not . ”
27316	27319	27314	27314	we	550	“ friends . ”
28128	28132	28133	28133	I	46	“ Back off ! ”
28375	28377	28368	28369	The girl	252	“ Golden ”
28766	28769	28770	28770	he	46	“ Awkward , ”
28792	28795	28796	28796	I	46	“ Perfect , ”
28824	28829	28812	28812	My	46	“ Keep me posted . ”
29170	29176	29177	29177	I	46	“ A bottle of Cristal , ”
29180	29198	29177	29177	I	46	“ Two flutes , strawberries , and whipped cream . Have it here in ten . Thanks . ”
29362	29366	29367	29367	she	49	“ Holy fuck , ”
29416	29424	29407	29407	I	46	“ Sorry , you caught me midworkout . ”
29425	29434	29435	29435	she	49	“ What are you doing in San Diego ? ”
29457	29474	29452	29452	She	49	“ I ’m not getting sucked into your sex - god vortex until you answer me . ”
29475	29482	29452	29452	She	49	“ I ’m here on business . ”
29483	29486	29487	29487	Her	49	“ Bullshit . ”
29505	29511	29494	29494	I	46	“ I can prove it . ”
29521	29528	29529	29529	she	49	“ You ’re way too optimistic , ”
29573	29578	29579	29579	he	0	“ Are you serious ? ”
29585	29593	29579	29579	he	0	“ Some of us sleep , Cross . ”
29594	29603	29579	29579	he	0	“ My wife wants to talk to you . ”
29604	29607	29579	29579	he	0	“ What ? ”
29611	29616	29579	29579	he	0	“ Where are you ? ”
29617	29622	29623	29623	I	46	“ In my room . ”
29631	29635	29623	29623	I	46	“ My attorney . ”
29636	29641	29642	29642	she	49	“ Are you nuts ? ”
29645	29660	29642	29642	she	49	“ It ’s five in the morning in New York ! On a Sunday ! ”
29661	29682	29623	29623	I	46	“ He ’s in the room next door . Take it . Ask him if I ’ve been working today . ”
29695	29703	29704	29704	she	49	“ You should get a new job , ”
29708	29714	29704	29704	she	49	“ Your boss is insane . ”
29721	29724	29725	29725	She	49	“ Before . ”
29730	29757	29725	29725	She	49	“ Thank God he ’s hot . Still , I might get my head checked . Sorry he woke you up . Go back to sleep . ”
29776	29786	29766	29766	I	46	“ As she said , go back to sleep . ”
29787	29797	29758	29758	Eva	49	“ I like her . She gives you shit . ”
29804	29814	29798	29798	My	46	“ I like her , too . Good night . ”
29831	29842	29823	29823	She	49	“ Why did n’t you tell me you were here ? ”
29843	29852	29894	29894	She	49	“ Did n’t want to cramp your style . ”
29853	29860	29823	29823	She	49	“ Do n’t you trust me ? ”
29865	29877	29861	29861	My	46	“ Asks the wife who tracked my phone to my hotel . ”
29878	29893	29894	29894	She	49	“ I was just curious if you were staying in the penthouse or not ! ”
29904	29911	29894	29894	She	49	“ And … I missed you . ”
29912	29920	29921	29921	I	46	“ I ’m right here , angel . ”
29928	29934	29921	29921	I	46	“ Come and get me . ”
29939	29948	29935	29935	Her	49	“ I have to shower . I stink . ”
29949	29955	29956	29956	I	46	“ We ’re both sweaty . ”
29970	29983	29964	29964	she	49	“ And I love the way you smell . You know that . ”
30070	30078	30063	30063	her	49	“ I love the way you feel . ”
30104	30124	30101	30101	She	49	“ No fair . You ’re all ripped and shiny and mostly naked , and I have no willpower . ”
30125	30132	30133	30133	I	46	“ You do n’t need any . ”
30148	30156	30133	30133	I	46	“ Let me have you , Eva . ”
30179	30182	30183	30183	she	49	“ Yum , ”
30186	30192	30183	30183	she	49	“ Look what I found . ”
30193	30196	30197	30197	I	46	“ Angel . ”
30202	30219	30197	30197	I	46	“ Tell me you want it exactly the way I want to give it to you . ”
30231	30238	30220	30220	She	49	“ And how would that be ? ”
30239	30277	30278	30278	I	46	“ Here . On the floor . Your jeans caught around one ankle , your shirt pushed up , your underwear shoved to the side . I want my cock inside you , my cum filling you . ”
30290	30315	30278	30278	I	46	“ I ’ll take care of you once I get you to bed , but right now … I just want to use you . ”
30319	30322	30316	30316	She	49	“ Gideon . ”
30430	30437	30438	30438	I	46	“ You ’ll stay with me , ”
30442	30448	30438	30438	I	46	“ Wake up with me . ”
30449	30452	30453	30453	Her	49	“ Yes . ”
30551	30554	30555	30555	I	46	“ Angel . ”
30571	30574	30575	30575	she	49	“ No , ”
30593	30600	30583	30583	I	46	“ I want you like this . ”
30601	30604	30612	30612	she	49	“ Gideon — ”
30697	30701	30702	30702	she	49	“ Oh God , ”
30707	30711	30702	30702	she	49	“ Your mouth … ”
30819	30822	30823	30823	Eva	49	“ Please , ”
30950	30953	30928	30928	I	46	“ Gideon . ”
30954	30957	30958	30958	I	46	“ Christ . ”
31037	31041	31042	31042	I	46	“ Take me , ”
31061	31066	31042	31042	I	46	“ Let me in . ”
31173	31176	31168	31168	they	600	“ Ace . ”
31177	31180	31181	31181	I	46	“ Hmm ? ”
31189	31243	31168	31168	they	600	“ If we could n’t be together — not that it would ever happen , just hypothetically — would you sleep with someone who looked like me ? I mean , I know I ’m not your usual type , but would you want to pretend with someone who reminded you of me ? ”
31244	31258	31168	31168	they	600	“ I ’m not going to speculate on situations that will never occur . ”
31259	31262	31263	31263	She	49	“ Gideon . ”
31278	31314	31263	31263	She	49	“ I get it . I tried to think if I would find any comfort in being with someone similar to you . Like maybe if it was dark and his hair was your length — ”
31319	31332	31315	31315	My	46	“ Eva . Do n’t tell me about fantasies of other men . ”
31333	31344	31403	31403	She	342	“ God . As usual , you ’re not listening . ”
31345	31353	31354	31354	I	46	“ What the fuck is this about ? ”
31373	31394	31403	31403	She	342	“ Brett ’s sleeping with that girl from the ‘ Golden ’ video . The one who looks like me . ”
31395	31402	31403	31403	She	342	“ No one looks like you . ”
31408	31415	31416	31416	I	46	“ She may have your curves , ”
31419	31447	31416	31416	I	46	“ but she does n’t sound like you . She does n’t have your sense of humor , your wit . She does n’t have your heart . ”

34024	34069	33985	33985	I	46	“ It ’s a standing offer . With an hour ’s notice , we can have you in the air and on your way . It ’ll make it easier for you and Eva to work around your schedules and maximize your time together . ”
34078	34111	34070	34071	My dad	339	“ Thank you . It might take me a while to get used to the idea . It ’s a bit extravagant , and I do n’t want to be a burden . ”
34122	34161	34112	34112	Gideon	339	“ That ’s what money ’s for . All I want is to make your daughter happy . Make that easy on me , Mr. Reyes . We all want to see Eva smiling as much as possible . ”
34244	34256	34235	34235	I	46	“ Making Eva happy . How can I argue with that ? ”

36273	36331	36270	36270	Lucky	128	“ Anyway , ace , I wanted to see if I could borrow one of your conference rooms for lunch with Megumi . She ’s back , but she ’s a mess and I think she wants to talk about it but there ’s really not a good place to go nearby that ’s private and quiet . ”
36332	36356	36271	36271	me	46	“ Use my office . I ’ll have something ordered in and you ’ll have the space to yourself while I ’m out . ”
36357	36361	36270	36270	Lucky	128	“ For real ? ”
36362	36390	36271	36271	me	46	“ Of course . However , I have to remind you that when you work for Cross Industries you ’ll have your own office to lunch in . ”
36396	36400	36391	36391	My	46	“ Shut up . ”
36443	36451	36452	36452	I	46	“ If it ’s not too weird , ”
36465	36485	36456	36456	she	77	“ we ’re going to use Gideon ’s office for lunch . He ’s out and it ’s private . ”
36486	36490	36491	36491	She	77	“ Oh man . ”
36498	36522	36491	36491	She	77	“ I ’m sorry , Eva . I should ’ve congratulated you . Will told me about your engagement , but I spaced . ”
36523	36535	36491	36491	She	77	“ It ’s totally okay . Do n’t worry about it . ”
36544	36552	36536	36536	She	77	“ I ’m really happy for you . ”
36553	36557	36491	36491	She	77	“ Thank you . ”
36641	36644	36645	36645	Megumi	77	“ Impressive , ”
36693	36709	36687	36687	He	658	“ Good afternoon , Miss Tramell . Scott said you should just go right in . ”
36710	36716	36687	36687	He	658	“ Has Mr. Cross left ? ”
36717	36729	36687	36687	He	658	“ I ’m not sure . I just took over here . ”
36730	36737	36738	36738	I	46	“ All right . Thank you . ”
36790	36793	36794	36794	I	46	“ Hi , ”
36813	36827	36798	36798	He	658	“ I do n’t think we ’ve been officially introduced . Gideon Cross . ”
36828	36832	36833	36833	She	77	“ Megumi Kaba . ”
36840	36847	36833	36833	She	77	“ Congratulations to you and Eva . ”
36858	36886	36854	36854	his	658	“ I ’m a lucky man . Make yourselves comfortable . If you need anything , just call up to reception and Ron will see to it . ”
36887	36893	36894	36894	I	46	“ We ’ll be fine , ”
36898	36916	36894	36894	I	46	“ You wo n’t even know we had a raging party in there while you ’re gone . ”
36921	36940	36917	36917	He	658	“ Good . I have a meeting later . Shot glasses and streamers would be interesting to explain . ”
36993	37001	36987	36987	he	658	“ Looking forward to making up later . ”
37024	37031	37009	37009	he	658	“ Enjoy your lunch , ladies . ”
37046	37054	37055	37055	Megumi	77	“ And you ’re still standing upright , ”
37062	37066	37055	37055	Megumi	77	“ Kills me . ”
37087	37091	37092	37092	I	46	“ Come on , ”
37096	37101	37092	37092	I	46	“ Let ’s eat . ”
37110	37118	37102	37102	She	77	“ I do n’t think I can . ”
37220	37228	37229	37229	Megumi	77	“ Have you ever experimented with BDSM ? ”
37266	37275	37250	37250	I	46	“ That acronym covers a lot of ground . ”
37281	37290	37276	37276	She	77	“ Being tied up and gagged . Helpless . ”
37291	37299	37276	37276	She	77	“ I ’ve been helpless , yes . ”
37314	37326	37304	37304	Her	77	“ Did you like it ? Did it turn you on ? ”
37327	37330	37331	37331	I	46	“ No . ”
37341	37351	37331	37331	I	46	“ But I was n’t with the right person . ”
37352	37357	37304	37304	Her	77	“ Were you scared ? ”
37358	37361	37331	37331	I	46	“ Terrified . ”
37362	37368	37304	37304	Her	77	“ Did he know that ? ”
37381	37392	37378	37378	my	46	“ Why are you asking me these questions , Megumi ? ”
37599	37603	37589	37589	I	46	“ fuck pad . ”
37754	37767	37751	37751	Cary	483	“ I ’m heading out . Call me if you need me . ”
37771	37775	37768	37768	She	49	“ Have fun . ”
37776	37784	37768	37768	She	49	“ My middle name , baby girl . ”
37818	37825	37807	37807	I	46	“ Talk to me , angel . ”
37826	37831	37832	37832	She	49	“ It ’s Megumi . ”
37835	37902	37832	37832	She	49	“ There ’s this guy she was into and things were n’t working out — he was hot - and - cold and could n’t commit — so she broke it off . But afterward , he stepped it up and she let him come over . They started messing around with a little bondage , but things got out of hand in a bad way . ”
37966	37974	37975	37975	I	46	“ Sounds like bad judgment all around , ”
37978	37990	37975	37975	I	46	“ One of them should ’ve known what they were doing . ”
37991	37997	37998	37998	She	49	“ That ’s the thing . ”
38005	38073	37998	37998	She	49	“ I went over it with Megumi . She said no — a lot — until he gagged her . He got off on her pain , Gideon . And now he ’s terrorizing her with texts and photos he took of her that night . She ’s asked him to stop , but he wo n’t . He ’s sick . Something ’s wrong with him . ”
38086	38110	38081	38081	I	46	“ Eva . She broke it off , and then took him back . He might not realize she ’s serious this time . ”
38128	38161	38111	38111	She	679	“ Do n’t make excuses for him ! She ’s bruised everywhere . It ’s been a week and the bruises are still dark . She could n’t sit down for days ! ”
38162	38169	38170	38170	I	46	“ I ’m not excusing him . ”
38175	38213	38170	38170	I	46	“ I would never justify an abuser — you know that . I do n’t have the whole story , but I know your story . Her situation is n’t like yours . Nathan was an aberration . ”
38214	38251	38111	38111	She	679	“ I ’m not projecting here , Gideon . I saw the pictures . I saw her wrists , her neck . I saw his texts . He ’s crossed a line . He ’s dangerous . ”
38252	38264	38170	38170	I	46	“ Even more reason for you to stay out of it . ”
38272	38289	38265	38265	Her	106	“ Oh my God . You did not just say that ! She ’s my friend . ”
38290	38342	38111	38111	She	679	“ And you ’re my wife . I know that look on your face . There are some battles that are n’t yours to fight . You will not confront this man the way you did my mother and Corinne . You will not put yourself in the middle of this . ”
38343	38377	38265	38265	Her	106	“ Did I say I was going to do that ? No , I did n’t . I ’m not an idiot . I asked Clancy to find him and talk to him . ”
38399	38407	38386	38389	her stepfather ’s man	134	“ You should n’t have done that . ”
38408	38419	38433	38433	She	681	“ What was I supposed to do instead ? Nothing ? ”
38420	38432	38386	38389	her stepfather ’s man	134	“ Preferably . At most , you should ’ve asked Raúl . ”
38439	38460	38433	38433	She	681	“ Why would I do that ? I do n’t know Raúl enough to ask him for a personal favor . ”
38466	38497	38461	38461	I	46	“ We discussed this . He works for you . You do n’t have to ask him for favors , you just need to tell him what you need done . ”
38498	38537	38433	38433	She	681	“ Raúl works for you . Besides , I ’m not some godfather sending out hired thugs to teach people lessons . I asked someone I trust , as a friend , to help another friend of mine . ”
38538	38583	38461	38461	I	46	“ However you rationalize it , the result is the same . You forget , Ben Clancy is employed to protect your stepfather ’s interests . He looks after you only because it gives him more control in securing Stanton ’s safety and reputation . ”
38587	38597	38584	38584	She	683	“ How would you know what his motives are ? ”
38598	38634	38433	38433	She	681	“ Angel , let ’s simplify . Focus on the fact that your mother and Stanton have been invading your privacy for some time . You ’re keeping that door open by using their resources . ”
38635	38638	38639	38639	Eva	49	“ Oh . ”
38648	38658	38639	38639	Eva	49	“ I had n’t thought of it that way . ”
38659	38702	38703	38703	My	46	“ You sent a trained professional to ‘ talk ’ to this guy . But you did n’t fully assess the possibility of blowback . If you ’d tapped Raúl to help you , he would ’ve known to be extra vigilant . ”
38707	38725	38703	38703	My	46	“ Damn it , Eva . Do n’t make it hard for me to keep you safe ! ”
38726	38729	38730	38730	She	49	“ Hey . ”
38735	38789	38730	38730	She	49	“ Do n’t worry , okay ? I told you what was happening as soon as you walked in the door . And Clancy was with me until an hour ago , when he dropped me off after my Krav Maga class . Nothing ’s happened yet that would put me in danger . ”
38808	38819	38820	38820	I	46	“ I want Raúl to escort you wherever you go , ”
38824	38845	38820	38820	I	46	“ To your classes , the gym , shopping … whatever . You need to let me look after you . ”
38846	38852	38853	38853	she	49	“ You do , baby , ”
38861	38870	38853	38853	she	49	“ But you can be obsessive about it . ”
38896	38916	38891	38891	she	49	“ There are things I ca n’t give you . Do n’t fight me on the things I can . ”
38917	38920	38921	38921	Her	49	“ Gideon . ”
38925	38933	38921	38921	Her	49	“ You give me everything I need . ”
38961	38993	38949	38949	I	46	“ You come home to another guy . You make your living by working for someone else . I ’m not as necessary to you as I ’d like to be . ”
39000	39016	38994	38994	Her	49	“ While I ’m about as dependent on you as I can stand to be . ”
39017	39022	38994	38994	Her	49	“ It ’s mutual . ”
39065	39077	39049	39049	her	49	“ Promise you ’ll come to me first from now on . ”
39078	39081	39082	39082	she	49	“ Okay , ”
39108	39118	39099	39099	She	49	“ I ’d like to come now , actually . ”
39119	39130	39131	39131	GIDEON	339	“ I am , as always , at your service . ”
39214	39219	39207	39207	I	46	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
39262	39265	39266	39266	She	49	“ Gideon . ”
39292	39299	39284	39284	she	49	“ What were you dreaming about ? ”
39435	39438	39439	39439	she	49	“ Shh , ”
39464	39473	39439	39439	she	49	“ It ’s okay . I ’m here . ”
39509	39512	39513	39513	She	49	“ Baby . ”
39565	39568	39569	39569	Eva	49	“ GIDEON ! ”
39952	39955	39956	39956	I	46	“ Come , ”
40064	40068	40058	40058	she	49	“ You suck . ”
40074	40086	40058	40058	she	49	“ I ’m shaky and you ’re not , sex machine . ”
40091	40096	40087	40087	I	46	“ I ’m sorry . ”
40097	40104	40105	40105	Her	49	“ No , you ’re not . ”
40116	40119	40120	40120	she	49	“ Paparazzi , ”
40158	40171	40172	40172	she	49	“ If I have to start actually styling my hair every day , ”
40175	40186	40172	40172	she	49	“ you ’re dealing with morning wood on your own . ”
40187	40190	40191	40191	I	46	“ Angel , ”
40200	40220	40191	40191	I	46	“ I ’d hire a full - time hairdresser for you before I gave up your cunt every morning . ”
40228	40247	40221	40221	She	49	“ God , you ’re crude , you know that ? Some women take offense to that word . ”
40276	40302	40270	40270	I	46	“ You ’re not one of them . However , I might be willing to revise . I recall orifice being a favorite of yours . ”
40303	40310	40311	40311	she	49	“ Oh God . Shut up , ”
40419	40422	40423	40423	She	319	“ Gideon . ”
40492	40503	40485	40485	she	49	“ Good morning , Corinne . How are you feeling ? ”
40504	40507	40508	40508	She	49	“ Better . ”
40529	40536	40513	40513	I	46	“ Do you have a moment ? ”
40559	40564	40548	40548	she	49	“ Give us ten . ”
40617	40627	40636	40636	they	707	“ I ’m sorry for your loss , Corinne . ”
40664	40686	40687	40687	She	49	“ I still ca n’t believe it . All these years of trying … I thought I could n’t get pregnant . ”
40698	40725	40687	40687	She	49	“ Jean - François told me you called a couple times asking about me . I wish you ’d called me . Or returned my calls . ”
40726	40739	40693	40693	Eva	49	“ I do n’t think that ’s appropriate , under the circumstances . ”
40790	40796	40797	40797	Corinne	54	“ You ’re getting married , ”
40811	40814	40807	40807	I	46	“ Yes . ”
40819	40827	40815	40815	Her	49	“ I ’d hoped Eva was lying . ”
40828	40842	40815	40815	Her	49	“ I ’m very protective when it comes to her . Tread lightly . ”
40854	40860	40847	40847	she	49	“ Do you love her ? ”
40861	40869	40815	40815	Her	49	“ That ’s none of your business . ”
40870	40877	40847	40847	she	49	“ That ’s not an answer . ”
40878	40900	40815	40815	Her	49	“ I do n’t owe you one , but if you need to hear it , she ’s everything to me . ”
40911	40926	40904	40904	her	49	“ Would it make a difference if I told you I ’m getting divorced ? ”
40927	40930	40931	40931	I	46	“ No . ”
40935	40985	40931	40931	I	46	“ You and I will never be together again , Corinne . I do n’t know how many times or in how many ways I can say it . I could never be what you want me to be . You dodged a bullet when you broke our engagement . ”
41002	41019	40986	40986	She	49	“ Is that what ’s keeping us apart ? You ca n’t forgive me for that ? ”
41020	41028	41029	41029	My	46	“ Forgive you ? I ’m thankful . ”
41038	41071	41029	41029	My	46	“ I do n’t mean to be cruel . I can guess how painful this might be . But I did n’t want you to have hope when there is n’t any . ”
41072	41085	41086	41086	she	49	“ What would you do if Eva said these things to you ? ”
41089	41099	41086	41086	she	49	“ Would you just give up and walk away ? ”
41100	41107	41108	41108	I	46	“ It ’s not the same . ”
41122	41156	41108	41108	I	46	“ You do n’t understand what I have with Eva . She needs me as much as I need her . For both our sakes , I would n’t ever give up trying . ”
41157	41164	41108	41108	I	46	“ I need you , Gideon . ”
41170	41203	41167	41167	me	46	“ You do n’t know me . I played a role for you . I let you see only what I wanted you to see , what I thought you could accept . ”
41271	41310	41260	41260	She	710	“ Elizabeth warned me that Eva was rewriting your past . I did n’t believe her . I ’ve never known you to be swayed by anyone , but I guess there ’s a first time for everything . ”
41311	41326	41327	41327	They	711	“ My mother believes what she wants and you ’re welcome to join her . ”
41444	41459	41436	41436	Corinne	54	“ I love you , Gideon . You used to love me , too . ”
41460	41467	41468	41468	I	46	“ I was grateful to you , ”
41471	41507	41468	41468	I	46	“ And I will always be . I was attracted to you , had fun with you , for a time I even needed you , but it would never have worked out between us . ”
41517	41554	41508	41508	She	54	“ I would have found Eva eventually . And I would ’ve wanted her , given up everything to have her . I would have left you to be with her . The end was inevitable . ”
41559	41570	41555	41555	Corinne	54	“ Well … at least we ’ll always be friends . ”
41590	41611	41584	41584	I	46	“ That wo n’t be possible . This is the last time you and I will speak to each other . ”
41656	41671	41675	41675	her	54	“ What do I have to live for if I do n’t have you ? ”
41739	41747	41748	41748	I	46	“ Do n’t put that on me , ”
41757	41775	41748	41748	I	46	“ I ’m not responsible for your happiness . I ’m not responsible for you at all . ”
41776	41783	41784	41784	she	54	“ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
41787	41793	41784	41784	she	54	“ This is n’t you . ”
41794	41800	41801	41801	I	46	“ You would n’t know . ”
41811	41825	41801	41801	I	46	“ Go home to your husband , Corinne . Take care of yourself . ”
41826	41830	41831	41831	she	54	“ Fuck you , ”
41834	41852	41831	41831	she	54	“ You ’re going to regret this , and I might be too hurt to forgive you . ”
41853	41860	41801	41801	I	46	“ Good - bye , Corinne . ”
41877	41881	41882	41882	I	46	“ Damn it . ”
41926	41932	41933	41933	she	54	“ Mark Garrity ’s office , ”
41936	41939	41948	41948	her	54	“ Angel . ”
41964	41967	41968	41968	She	54	“ Gideon . ”
41979	41985	41968	41968	She	54	“ Is everything all right ? ”
42034	42040	42022	42022	I	46	“ I miss you already . ”
42053	42056	42057	42057	she	252	“ Liar , ”
42061	42067	42057	42057	she	252	“ You ’re too busy . ”
42068	42082	42022	42022	I	46	“ Never . Now , tell me how much you ’re missing me . ”
42086	42100	42083	42083	She	252	“ You ’re terrible . What am I going to do with you ? ”
42101	42104	42057	42057	she	252	“ Everything . ”
42105	42129	42083	42083	She	252	“ Damn straight . So what ’s up ? It ’s going to be a busy day and I have to get going . ”
42144	42156	42140	42140	My	46	“ Just wanted you to know I ’m thinking about you . ”
42157	42178	42184	42184	her	252	“ Good . Do n’t stop . And FYI , it ’s nice to hear you not grumpy at work . ”
42215	42222	42205	42205	I	46	“ Tell me you love me . ”
42223	42234	42197	42197	she	252	“ Madly . You rock my world , Mr. Cross . ”
42250	42258	42235	42235	I	46	“ You ’re the center of mine . ”
42297	42310	42311	42312	my brother	558	“ You ’ve got to fuck up everything , do n’t you ? ”
42345	42355	42338	42338	He	303	“ Good afternoon to you , too , Christopher . ”
42403	42417	42418	42418	he	303	“ Did you forget that Vidal Records is Ireland ’s legacy , too ? ”
42425	42431	42418	42418	he	303	“ I never forget that . ”
42432	42466	42418	42418	he	303	“ Then you just do n’t give a shit . Your vendetta against Brett Kline is costing us money , damn you . You ’re hurting all of us , not just him . ”
42501	42503	42491	42491	Christopher	558	“ Golden ”
42600	42614	42596	42596	I	46	“ I ’m assuming you ’re going to get to the point soon . ”
42615	42644	42574	42579	board members with his industry savvy	722	“ Do n’t play innocent , Gideon . You knew exactly what you were doing when you systematically destroyed every media opportunity Vidal secured for Six - Ninths . ”
42645	42664	42596	42596	I	46	“ If those opportunities were centered on Eva , they had no business being pursued to begin with . ”
42665	42674	42675	42675	His	558	“ That ’s not your decision to make . ”
42683	42785	42675	42675	His	558	“ Do you even comprehend the damage you ’ve done ? Behind the Music has delayed their special because Sam Yimara no longer owns the rights to the footage he compiled of the band ’s early years . Diners , Drive - Ins and Dives ca n’t include Pete ’s 69th Street Bar in their San Diego episode , because it ’s being demolished before they can film their segment . And Rolling Stone is n’t interested in pursuing their proposed piece on ‘ Golden ’ since your engagement was announced . The song loses its interest without the happy ending . ”
42786	42810	42675	42675	His	558	“ I can get you the footage VH1 wants . Put them in touch with Arash and he ’ll take care of it . ”
42811	42825	42675	42675	His	558	“ After you remove all traces of Eva ? What ’s the point ? ”
42830	42845	42826	42826	My	46	“ The point is supposed to be Six - Ninths , not my wife . ”
42846	42854	42855	42855	he	46	“ She ’s not your wife yet , ”
42859	42910	42855	42855	he	46	“ and that ’s your problem . You ’re afraid she ’s going to go back to Brett . You ’re not really her type and we all know it . You can eat her pussy at parties , but what she really likes is blowing rock stars in public — ”
43078	43082	43083	43083	he	558	“ Do it , ”
43093	43110	43083	43083	he	558	“ You ’ve wanted me dead since the day I was born . Why stop now ? ”
43111	43116	43147	43148	my brother	558	“ You ’re insane . ”
43137	43146	43147	43148	my brother	558	“ I ’m fucking onto you , asshole , ”
43157	43188	43147	43148	my brother	558	“ I ’ve talked to members of the board . Explained what you ’re doing . You want to take me down , I ’m fighting you all the way . ”
43189	43231	43257	43257	I	46	“ You ’ve lost it , you fucking idiot . Take your crazy somewhere else . And leave Eva alone . You want to make an enemy out of me , screwing around with her is the way to do it . ”
43245	43256	43232	43232	He	558	“ Does she know what you ’re doing to Brett ? ”
43275	43289	43257	43257	I	46	“ I ’m not doing anything to Kline . I ’m protecting Eva . ”
43290	43299	43257	43257	I	46	“ And the band is just collateral damage ? ”
43300	43306	43257	43257	I	46	“ Better him than her . ”
43307	43311	43312	43312	he	558	“ Fuck that , ”
43315	43319	43257	43257	I	46	“ Fuck you . ”
43338	43397	43326	43326	I	46	“ For Christ ’s sake , Christopher , they ’re talented . They do n’t need a gimmick to be successful . If you were n’t so damned eager to make me pay for something you ’ve imagined I ’ve done , you ’d be concentrating on better angles than making them into a one - hit wonder . ”
43406	43431	43398	43398	He	558	“ Do n’t tell me how to do my job . And do n’t get in my way or I ’ll shove you out . ”
43482	43488	43473	43473	I	46	“ Get me Arash Madani . ”
43595	43603	43592	43592	he	144	“ Let ’s talk about the nightmares . ”
43672	43678	43665	43666	someone else	678	“ You talked to Eva . ”
43691	43701	43702	43702	he	144	“ She sent me an e - mail earlier , ”
43724	43734	43718	43718	His	144	“ Does it bother you that she contacted me ? ”
43743	43776	43735	43735	I	46	“ She worries . If talking to you alleviates that , I wo n’t complain . You ’re also her therapist , so she has a right to discuss it with you . ”
43777	43797	43718	43718	His	144	“ But you do n’t like it . You ’d prefer to choose which issues you share with me . ”
43798	43807	43735	43735	I	46	“ I ’d prefer Eva to feel safe . ”
43812	43823	43808	43809	Dr. Petersen	144	“ That ’s why you ’re here . For her . ”
43824	43828	43718	43718	His	144	“ Of course . ”
43829	43842	43808	43809	Dr. Petersen	144	“ What does she hope the outcome of our sessions will be ? ”
43843	43849	43718	43718	His	144	“ Do n’t you know ? ”
43853	43865	43850	43850	He	144	“ I ’d like to hear your answer to that question . ”
43876	43905	43870	43870	I	46	“ Eva previously made bad decisions . She learned to rely on the advice of therapists . It worked well for her and it ’s what she knows . ”
43906	43914	43718	43718	His	144	“ How do you feel about that ? ”
43915	43923	43924	43924	I	46	“ Do I have to feel anything ? ”
43927	43948	43924	43924	I	46	“ She asked me to try it out and I agreed . Relationships are about compromise , are n’t they ? ”
43949	43952	43958	43958	he	144	“ Yes . ”
43967	43977	43958	43958	he	144	“ Tell me about your previous experience with therapy . ”
43987	43998	43978	43978	I	46	“ I was a child . I do n’t remember . ”
44010	44025	43999	43999	He	144	“ How did you feel about seeing someone ? Angry , frightened , sad ? ”
44036	44043	44033	44033	I	46	“ A little of all that . ”
44044	44056	44033	44033	I	46	“ I imagine you felt similarly about your father ’s suicide . ”
44067	44071	44057	44057	I	46	“ Your point ? ”
44072	44080	44081	44081	He	144	“ We ’re just talking , Gideon . ”
44085	44112	44081	44081	He	144	“ I often feel like you ’re wondering what the angle is . I do n’t have an angle . I just want to help you . ”
44168	44180	44181	44182	Shawna Ellison	483	“ HEY , GIRL . WHAT are your thoughts on karaoke ? ”
44290	44293	44294	44294	I	46	“ Well , ”
44297	44317	44294	44294	I	46	“ since I ’m tone deaf , my thoughts on singing in public are pretty much nonexistent . Why ? ”
44381	44401	44402	44402	she	328	“ Because I was thinking we could go to this new karaoke bar I heard about today at work , ”
44405	44441	44402	44402	she	328	“ Instead of those cheesy background tracks , this place has a live band . You do n’t have to sing if you do n’t want to . A lot people go just to watch . ”
44453	44462	44442	44442	I	46	“ What ’s the name of this place ? ”
44463	44477	44402	44402	she	328	“ The Starlight Lounge . I thought it might be fun for Friday . ”
44528	44536	44537	44537	I	46	“ I ’ll mention it to Gideon . ”
44550	44554	44537	44537	I	46	“ Looks nice . ”
44593	44608	44627	44627	She	742	“ Right ? I thought so , too . And it ’ll be entertaining . ”
44609	44626	44627	44627	She	742	“ Yeah . Wait ’ til you see Cary with a mic . He ’s shameless . ”
44643	44662	44627	44627	She	742	“ So is Steven . Let me know what you decide . Ca n’t wait to see you . ”
44868	44871	44872	44872	Cary	483	“ Hey . ”
45018	45023	45006	45006	his	416	“ Whatcha working on ? ”
45024	45039	44993	44995	My best friend	416	“ Making lists . I want to get started on something for abuse survivors . ”
45040	45048	45006	45006	his	416	“ Yeah ? What are you thinking ? ”
45059	45095	45051	45051	my	46	“ I do n’t really know . I keep thinking about Megumi and how she did n’t tell anyone . I did n’t tell anyone , either . Neither did you , until way later . ”
45096	45106	45107	45107	he	416	“ Because who ’s going to give a shit ? ”
45118	45159	45051	45051	my	46	“ And it ’s scary to talk about it . There are a lot of hotlines and shelters for victims . I want to find something else that makes a difference , but I do n’t have any groundbreaking ideas . ”
45160	45167	45107	45107	he	416	“ So talk to idea people . ”
45172	45180	45168	45168	My	46	“ You make it sound so easy . ”
45181	45201	45202	45202	He	416	“ Hell , why reinvent the wheel ? Find someone who ’s doing it right and help ’em out . ”
45231	45238	45239	45239	I	46	“ Tell me about your day , ”
45325	45343	45317	45317	He	483	“ I had a shoot this morning , and then I saw Trey for a late lunch . ”
45344	45355	45317	45317	He	483	“ Did you say anything to him about the baby ? ”
45361	45380	45356	45356	He	483	“ I thought about it , but I could n’t do it . I ’m such a dick . ”
45381	45398	45317	45317	He	483	“ Do n’t be hard on yourself . It ’s a rough spot you ’re in . ”
45412	45483	45399	45399	Cary	483	“ I was thinking the other day how much easier it ’d be if Trey swung both ways . Then we could both be banging Tat and each other , and I could have it all . Then I realized I did n’t want to share Trey with Tat . Do n’t mind sharing her . But not him . Tell me that does n’t make me a total douche . ”
45496	45502	45487	45487	I	46	“ It makes you human . ”
45538	45566	45532	45532	Gideon	339	“ In a perfect world , none of us would be selfish , but that ’s not the way it goes . We just do our best . ”
45567	45576	45577	45577	he	483	“ You ’re always making excuses for me , ”
45588	45591	45580	45580	I	46	“ No , ”
45606	45623	45592	45592	I	46	“ I just forgive you . Someone has to , since you wo n’t forgive yourself . ”
45642	45652	45653	45654	Steven Ellison	328	“ We were celebrating our engagement two weeks ago , ”
45669	45677	45653	45654	Steven Ellison	328	“ Now we get to celebrate yours . ”
45708	45716	45693	45694	my boss	328	“ Must be something in the water . ”
45717	45721	45722	45722	He	328	“ Must be . ”
45733	45743	45722	45722	He	328	“ Mark ’s not losing you , is he ? ”
45744	45747	45748	45748	Mark	757	“ Steven , ”
45755	45759	45748	45748	Mark	757	“ Do n’t . ”
45760	45767	45768	45768	I	46	“ I ’m not going anywhere , ”
45808	45818	45819	45819	Mark	757	“ Well , I ’m happy to hear that , ”
45822	45827	45828	45828	Steven	328	“ Me , too . ”
45845	45855	45828	45828	Steven	328	“ We want you to stick around , kid . ”
45856	45861	45862	45862	I	46	“ I ’m sticking , ”
45990	45997	45975	45975	Steven	328	“ I ’m having the moussaka . ”
45998	46003	46004	46004	I	46	“ Me , too . ”
46009	46015	46016	46016	Mark	757	“ Pepperoni pizza for me , ”
46028	46031	46032	46032	he	328	“ Hell , ”
46036	46043	46032	46032	he	328	“ marrying Steven is adventure enough . ”
46060	46086	46046	46046	Steven	328	“ So , Eva … how ’d Cross propose ? I ’m guessing he did n’t blurt it out in the middle of the street . ”
46107	46110	46111	46111	I	46	“ No , ”
46114	46146	46111	46111	I	46	“ He broke the news to me on a private beach . I ca n’t say he asked , because he pretty much just told me that we ’re getting married . ”
46161	46168	46155	46155	Steven	328	“ Romance , Gideon Cross style . ”
46172	46195	46169	46169	I	46	“ Absolutely . He ’ll be the first to tell you he ’s not romantic , but he ’s wrong about that . ”
46196	46203	46147	46147	Mark	757	“ Let me see the ring . ”
46247	46265	46235	46236	Elizabeth Vidal	319	“ Whoa . Mark , darlin ’ , you have got to get me one of those . ”
46293	46311	46287	46287	Mark	757	“ So you can shatter it on a job site ? Let me get right on that . ”
46312	46328	46345	46346	my boss	328	“ Diamonds are tough little beauties , but I ’ll take good care of it . ”
46329	46344	46345	46346	my boss	328	“ You ’ll have to wait until I run an agency of my own , ”
46352	46358	46359	46359	Steven	328	“ I can do that . ”
46364	46370	46359	46359	Steven	328	“ You register anywhere yet ? ”
46376	46379	46371	46371	I	46	“ You ? ”
46380	46385	46386	46386	He	328	“ Hell , yeah . ”
46403	46413	46386	46386	He	328	“ Tell me what you think about these patterns . ”
46564	46567	46568	46568	I	46	“ thank you ”
46836	46839	46840	46840	she	155	“ Eva , ”
46844	46848	46849	46849	She	155	“ Detective Graves . ”
46893	46908	46879	46879	Her	155	“ Spotted you on my way out . Heard about your engagement . Congratulations . ”
47026	47030	47031	47031	I	46	“ Thank you , ”
47049	47056	47042	47042	Gideon	339	“ I ’m a lucky girl . ”
47066	47072	47057	47057	She	155	“ Where ’s Ben Clancy ? ”
47076	47084	47073	47073	I	46	“ I do n’t know . Why ? ”
47085	47108	47109	47109	Her	155	“ Just curious . You know , one of the feds I talked to about Yedemsky also has the last name Clancy . ”
47115	47123	47109	47109	Her	155	“ You think they ’re any relation ? ”
47158	47161	47147	47147	I	46	“ What ? ”
47173	47185	47162	47162	She	155	“ Probably not . Anyway , I ’ll see you later . ”
47206	47214	47199	47199	she	155	“ You inviting me to the wedding ? ”
47226	47240	47215	47215	I	46	“ The reception . We ’re keeping the wedding small , just family . ”
47241	47249	47215	47215	I	46	“ Really ? Did n’t expect that . ”
47259	47270	47215	47215	I	46	“ He ’s full of surprises , is n’t he ? ”
47402	47418	47395	47395	I	46	“ I ’m looking to support an organization that does good work for abuse survivors . ”
47423	47430	47419	47419	Her	155	“ Why are you telling me ? ”
47431	47440	47395	47395	I	46	“ I do n’t know where to start . ”
47447	47451	47452	47452	she	155	“ Try Crossroads , ”
47456	47466	47452	47452	she	155	“ I ’ve heard good things about that one . ”
47586	47591	47596	47596	he	46	“ Hi , ace . ”
47664	47668	47669	47669	He	46	“ Angel mine . ”
47688	47695	47669	47669	He	46	“ What are you working on ? ”
47745	47767	47727	47727	I	46	“ It was Clancy , Gideon . Clancy and his brother in the FBI planted Nathan ’s bracelet on that mobster . ”
47771	47775	47768	47768	He	46	“ I figured . ”
47776	47782	47783	47783	I	46	“ You did ? How ? ”
47790	47804	47783	47783	I	46	“ Why did n’t you say something ? I ’ve been worried sick . ”
47825	47863	47805	47805	Gideon	339	“ I do n’t have all the answers yet . Angus and I have been narrowing it down . Whoever was responsible was either watching Nathan or me and following our movements , so we started there . ”
47864	47871	47805	47805	Gideon	339	“ Or watching both of you . ”
47872	47890	47805	47805	Gideon	339	“ Precisely . Who would do that ? Who had a stake in it ? In you ? ”
47891	47894	47895	47895	I	46	“ Jesus . ”
47900	47910	47895	47895	I	46	“ Detective Graves knows . The FBI . Clancy — ”
47911	47914	47805	47805	Gideon	339	“ Graves ? ”
47915	47942	47895	47895	I	46	“ She brought it up at Parker ’s studio tonight . Tossed it at me in passing just to see how I ’d take the news . ”
47947	47969	47943	47943	His	46	“ Either she ’s fucking with you or she wants you to stop worrying . My bet is on the latter . ”
48027	48036	48037	48037	I	46	“ We have to trust her , then ? ”
48098	48125	48092	48092	His	791	“ I ’m going to talk to Clancy just to be sure , but he ’s no fool . He would n’t leave anything to chance . ”
48147	48165	48126	48126	My	46	“ Do n’t keep things like this from me , Gideon . Stop trying to protect me . ”
48166	48171	48172	48172	His	791	“ I ca n’t . ”
48180	48206	48172	48172	His	791	“ Maybe I should have said something , but we have only a few hours alone every day and I want them to be perfect . ”
48207	48218	48126	48126	My	46	“ Gideon . You ’ve got to let me in . ”
48233	48242	48219	48219	His	791	“ I ’m working on it , Eva . ”
48410	48420	48407	48407	his	46	“ Hello to you , too , Mrs. Cross . ”
48447	48454	48455	48455	He	46	“ Hmm … you like that . ”
48467	48471	48458	48458	My	46	“ It hurt . ”
48514	48521	48500	48500	He	46	“ I ’m sorry , angel . ”
48555	48559	48543	48543	He	46	“ Stop it . ”
48560	48567	48568	48568	he	46	“ It ’s turning you on , ”
48574	48578	48579	48579	I	46	“ It hurts ! ”
48630	48641	48642	48642	His	46	“ Want me to kiss it and make it better ? ”
48658	48677	48655	48655	He	46	“ Christ . What you do to me , Eva . I ’ve got so much to do … ”
48695	48703	48688	48688	My	46	“ We have to go to work . ”
48718	48727	48704	48704	He	46	“ We ’re playing with these garters later . ”
48873	48876	48877	48877	Cary	483	“ Whoa . ”
48891	48900	48877	48877	Cary	483	“ Do n’t forget we eat in here . ”
48944	48950	48951	48951	he	416	“ Good morning , Cary , ”
48969	48976	48977	48977	Cary	483	“ For you two , maybe . ”
48990	49018	48977	48977	Cary	483	“ Sadly , I ’m too tired to get turned on by the show . Not making me feel too optimistic about the rest of the day . ”
49073	49081	49082	49082	I	46	“ Do you have a shoot today ? ”
49085	49123	49058	49061	such a striking man	801	“ No . Tat does , and she wants me there . She ’s got morning sickness and shit , so I ’m going to be around to help her out if she ’s not feeling well . ”
49134	49146	49124	49124	I	46	“ That ’s awesome , Cary . You ’re the best . ”
49161	49188	49152	49152	he	483	“ What else can I do ? I ca n’t get sick for her , and she ’s got to work as long as she can . ”
49189	49203	49152	49152	he	483	“ You ’ll let me know if there ’s anything I can do ? ”
49207	49210	49204	49204	He	483	“ Sure . ”
49225	49257	49211	49211	Gideon	339	“ If you ’ve got the time , Cary , I ’d like you to be there for the appointment with the designer who ’s renovating our place on Fifth Avenue . ”
49258	49268	49269	49269	Cary	483	“ Yeah , I ’ve been thinking about that . ”
49277	49333	49269	49269	Cary	483	“ I have n’t totally worked things out with Tat , but I figure we ’ll be shacking up together at some point . You guys are n’t going to want a screaming baby next door . When you ’re ready for that , you ’ll have your own , not put up with mine . ”
49334	49337	49338	49340	My best friend	416	“ Cary … ”
49370	49380	49381	49381	Gideon	339	“ Both sections of the penthouse are fully soundproofed , ”
49399	49422	49381	49381	Gideon	339	“ We can make anything work , Cary . You just tell me what concerns you have and we ’ll address them . ”
49438	49500	49423	49423	Cary	483	“ Thanks . I ’ll talk to Tat about it . It ’s hard , you know ? She does n’t want to think about what ’s next and I ca n’t stop thinking about it . There ’s going to be this person who ’s totally dependent on us , and we need to be prepared for that . Somehow . ”
49576	49586	49587	49587	I	46	“ That ’s what families are for , Cary . ”
49592	49603	49587	49587	I	46	“ To drive each other crazy and straight into therapy . ”
49783	49791	49792	49792	Cary	483	“ I ’ve got time next week , ”
49806	49825	49803	49803	Gideon	339	“ Let ’s plan on Wednesday , then . Give us some room to recover from the weekend . ”
49831	49840	49826	49826	Cary	483	“ So it ’s that kind of party . ”
49845	49852	49841	49841	I	46	“ Is there any other kind ? ”
49853	49858	49859	49859	I	46	“ How are you ? ”
49924	49927	49918	49918	She	77	“ Better . ”
49928	49935	49936	49936	I	46	“ Does Lacey know what happened ? ”
49960	49966	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ Not all of it . ”
49977	49983	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ I feel so stupid . ”
49984	50004	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ We ’re always quick to blame ourselves , but no means no . It ’s not your fault . ”
50005	50013	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ I know that , but still … ”
50021	50030	50014	50014	I	46	“ Have you thought about talking to someone ? ”
50043	50050	50031	50031	She	77	“ Like a counselor or something ? ”
50051	50054	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ Yes . ”
50055	50070	50031	50031	She	77	“ Not really . How do you even start looking for someone like that ? ”
50071	50102	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ We ’ve got mental health benefits . Call the number on the back of your insurance card . They ’ll give you a list of providers to choose from . ”
50103	50111	50031	50031	She	77	“ And I just … pick one ? ”
50112	50118	49967	49967	Megumi	77	“ I ’ll help you . ”
50170	50184	50166	50166	Her	77	“ You ’re a good friend , Eva . Thanks for being here . ”
50192	50200	50201	50201	she	77	“ He has n’t texted me lately , ”
50208	50233	50201	50201	she	77	“ I keep dreading that he ’s going to , but every hour that goes by that he does n’t , I feel better . ”
50250	50253	50240	50240	I	46	“ Good . ”
50393	50399	50379	50379	She	657	“ Can I help you ? ”
50400	50409	50410	50410	I	46	“ No , I ’m good , thanks , ”
50992	50995	50996	50996	Chris	163	“ Eva . ”
51003	51008	50996	50996	Chris	163	“ How are you ? ”
51009	51014	51015	51015	He	163	“ Good . You ? ”
51027	51048	51015	51015	He	163	“ Ca n’t complain . Do you have a minute ? I ’d like to talk to you about something . ”
51049	51052	51057	51057	me	46	“ Sure . ”
51067	51071	51072	51072	he	303	“ Mr. Vidal , ”
51079	51106	51072	51072	he	303	“ Miss Tramell . Mr. Cross will be another fifteen minutes or so . Can I get either of you something to drink while you wait ? ”
51112	51136	51107	51107	Chris	163	“ Nothing for me , thank you . But if you have a private room we could use , that would be great . ”
51137	51141	51142	51142	Scott	303	“ Of course . ”
51147	51154	51155	51155	I	46	“ I ’m good , thanks , ”
51207	51213	51214	51214	he	303	“ If you need anything , ”
51217	51240	51214	51214	he	303	“ just dial one and we ’ll take care of it . There ’s coffee in the cabinet there , and water . ”
51244	51253	51241	51241	Chris	163	“ Thank you , Scott . Appreciate it . ”
51280	51291	51292	51292	He	303	“ First , let me congratulate you on your engagement . ”
51295	51327	51292	51292	He	303	“ Ireland speaks very highly of you , and I know you ’ve been instrumental in bringing her and Gideon closer together . I ca n’t thank you enough for that . ”
51328	51341	51371	51371	he	303	“ I did n’t do much , but I appreciate the thought . ”
51386	51393	51394	51394	he	303	“ It ’s a beautiful ring , ”
51398	51415	51394	51394	he	303	“ I ’m sure it meant a great deal to Gideon to give it to you . ”
51450	51517	51445	51445	Chris	163	“ Elizabeth is taking this very hard . I ’m sure there are a lot of complicated emotions a mother must feel when her first child decides to get married , especially with a son . My mother used to say that a son is a son until he gets married — then he ’s a husband — but a daughter is a daughter for life . ”
51663	51669	51670	51670	I	46	“ Let ’s be honest , ”
51674	51689	51670	51670	I	46	“ Your wife did n’t have this reaction when Gideon became engaged to Corinne . ”
51721	51769	51714	51714	His	623	“ I think that was different because Gideon had been with Corinne awhile and we knew her . You and Gideon have n’t been together long , so there ’s still some adjusting to do . I do n’t want you to take it personally , Eva . ”
51891	51950	51882	51882	I	46	“ It ’s very personal , Mr. Vidal . Elizabeth is feeling threatened because I ’m not going to put up with this bullshit anymore . You both owe Gideon an apology and she needs to admit to the abuse . I ’m going to keep pressuring her to make things right . You can count on that . ”
51956	51963	51951	51951	His	163	“ What are you talking about ? ”
51969	51972	51964	51964	I	46	“ Seriously ? ”
51973	51981	51982	51982	he	163	“ Elizabeth would never abuse her children , ”
51991	52000	51982	51982	he	163	“ She ’s a wonderful , devoted mother . ”
52027	52040	52010	52010	he	163	“ I think you ’d better explain yourself , Eva . Fast . ”
52073	52079	52062	52062	He	163	“ Start talking . Now . ”
52087	52099	52080	52080	My	46	“ He was raped . By the therapist he was seeing . ”
52114	52151	52100	52100	Chris	163	“ He told Elizabeth , but she did n’t believe him . She knows he was telling the truth , but she ’s denied it for whatever screwed - up reason she ’s come up with . ”
52160	52163	52152	52152	He	163	“ No . ”
52175	52229	52164	52168	The one - word rebuff	853	“ Are you going to deny it , too ? Who would lie about something like that ? Do you have any idea how hard it was for him to admit to what was happening ? How confused he must have been that a man he trusted would do those things to him ? ”
52236	52255	52230	52230	Chris	163	“ Elizabeth would never ignore … something like that . There ’s a misunderstanding . You ’re confused . ”
52275	52303	52256	52256	I	46	“ She went through the motions . That ’s all . When push came to shove , she chose to side with everyone but her own child . ”
52304	52314	52256	52256	I	46	“ You do n’t know what you ’re saying . ”
52340	52393	52329	52329	I	46	“ Gideon was raped . One of these days , you and your wife are going to look him in the eye like I ’m looking at you and you ’re going to admit it . And you ’re going to apologize for all the years he ’s lived with that alone . ”
52394	52397	52398	52398	Gideon	339	“ Eva . ”
52480	52493	52473	52473	Chris	163	“ Gideon . What ’s going on ? What is she saying ? ”
52559	52564	52565	52565	I	46	“ Gideon , wait , ”
52573	52576	52565	52565	I	46	“ We — ”
52577	52583	52584	52584	he	163	“ Not a fucking word , ”
52823	52827	52828	52828	I	46	“ Goddamn it , ”
52914	52917	52906	52906	She	49	“ Gideon … ”
52941	52956	52926	52926	I	46	“ Open your mouth again and that ’s what I ’m putting in it . ”
53131	53135	53136	53136	I	46	“ Not today , ”
53140	53143	53144	53144	she	49	“ Okay , ”
53182	53185	53169	53169	She	49	“ Jesus . ”
53195	53204	53189	53189	Angus	46	“ Couples therapy means the both of you . ”
53210	53215	53205	53205	I	46	“ Stop enjoying this . ”
53229	53243	53219	53219	his	46	“ She loves you , lad , whether you like it or naw . ”
53244	53251	53252	53252	I	46	“ Of course I like it , ”
53276	53288	53271	53271	I	46	“ That does n’t mean she ’s not a loose cannon . ”
53313	53337	53308	53308	his	46	“ Sometimes you ’ll lead , sometimes you ’ll follow . Expect you ’ll grumble about the following part for a while yet . ”
53343	53349	53338	53338	I	46	“ She talked to Chris . ”
53360	53367	53350	53350	His	46	“ I saw him go in . ”
53368	53379	53380	53380	I	46	“ Why wo n’t she leave it the hell alone ? ”
53401	53409	53380	53380	I	46	“ She ca n’t change the past . ”
53410	53421	53422	53422	He	46	“ It ’s not the past she ’s thinking of . ”
53431	53437	53422	53422	He	46	“ It ’s the future . ”
53474	53483	53484	53484	she	49	“ The whole situation makes me so mad , ”
53501	53504	53488	53488	she	49	“ Gideon . ”
53543	53548	53549	53549	I	46	“ Eva . Doctor . ”
53572	53587	53564	53565	Dr. Petersen	144	“ Hello , Gideon . I ’m glad you could join us after all . ”
53602	53618	53619	53619	I	46	“ We ’re making plans to move back into the penthouse on Fifth with Cary , ”
53640	53654	53634	53634	I	46	“ I expect it will be a rocky transition for all of us . ”
53665	53691	53658	53659	Dr. Petersen	144	“ Eva was just telling me about a visit with your stepfather . I would like to hear more about that before we move on . ”
53700	53708	53692	53692	I	46	“ It ’s not open for discussion . ”
53814	53819	53820	53820	I	46	“ I ’ll explain , ”
54039	54046	54047	54047	I	46	“ You ’re disappointed in me , ”
54068	54075	54055	54055	Eva	49	“ No , not in you . ”
54165	54201	54156	54156	Her	49	“ We have n’t been together long , Gideon , and you ’ve come so far already . I ’m not going to push you to go farther so soon . These things take time . ”
54237	54241	54242	54242	I	46	“ Kiss me , ”
54361	54368	54355	54355	I	46	“ Eva … I ’m sorry . ”
54369	54378	54379	54379	She	49	“ Shh , baby , it ’s okay . ”
54393	54403	54379	54379	She	49	“ You do n’t have to apologize to me . ”
54449	54463	54444	54444	My	46	“ You ’re upset that I did n’t want to talk about Chris . ”
54464	54480	54481	54481	She	49	“ I was n’t expecting you to avoid it so completely , that ’s all . ”
54495	54514	54481	54481	She	49	“ I should ’ve considered the possibility , considering how angry you were when we left the Crossfire . ”
54515	54520	54444	54444	My	46	“ Not with you . ”
54521	54525	54481	54481	She	49	“ At Chris ? ”
54526	54531	54532	54532	I	46	“ At the situation . ”
54536	54595	54532	54532	I	46	“ You ’re expecting people to change and that does n’t happen . In the meantime , you ’re stirring up trouble at a time when we ’ve got enough on our plates . I just want to have some peace with you , Eva . Days when we ’re alone and happy and free of any bullshit . ”
54596	54612	54481	54481	She	49	“ And nights where you go to sleep in another bed ? In another room ? ”
54618	54627	54613	54613	My	46	“ Is that what this is all about ? ”
54628	54652	54532	54532	I	46	“ Not completely , but some of it , yeah . Gideon , I want to be with you . Waking and sleeping . ”
54653	54659	54613	54613	My	46	“ I understand , but — ”
54660	54726	54532	54532	I	46	“ That peace you ’re looking for ? You ’re pretending you have it during the day and suffering without it at night . It ’s tearing you up from the inside , and it ’s shredding me watching it happen to you . I do n’t want you to live like this forever . I do n’t want us to live forever like this . ”
54796	54809	54856	54856	She	884	“ Eva … I am talking to Dr. Petersen about the nightmares . ”
54810	54819	54856	54856	She	884	“ But not about what ’s causing them . ”
54820	54829	54830	54830	I	46	“ You ’re assuming Hugh is the problem , ”
54845	54855	54830	54830	I	46	“ We ’ve been talking about my father instead . ”
54860	54920	54856	54856	She	884	“ Ace … I do n’t know exactly what ’s in your dreams , but I ’ve seen you wake up in two different ways : ready to beat up someone or crying like your heart is breaking . When you come out swinging , the things you say make me damn near certain you ’re fighting off Hugh . ”
54953	54956	54957	54957	She	49	“ Listen . ”
54965	55026	54957	54957	She	49	“ I said I was n’t going to push you and I meant it . If we were two years into our relationship , I ’d put up a fuss , maybe . But it ’s only been a few months , Gideon . The fact that you ’re seeing someone and talking about your dad is enough for now . ”
55027	55031	55076	55076	Nathan	310	“ Is it ? ”
55032	55075	54957	54957	She	49	“ Yes . But there are things we can never discuss that are haunting you , too . Dr. Petersen is already working with a handicap because of that . The more you keep from him , the less he can help . ”
55087	55096	55076	55076	Nathan	310	“ I ’m making an effort , Eva . ”
55097	55101	55102	55102	Her	887	“ I know . ”
55118	55144	55102	55102	Her	887	“ Just tell me that you ’re not hoping to avoid talking about it forever . Tell me you ’re just working up to it . ”
55232	55239	55240	55240	I	46	“ I ’m doing my best , ”
55244	55251	55240	55240	I	46	“ That ’s not an answer . ”
55252	55264	55240	55240	I	46	“ It ’s all I ’ve got right now , Eva . ”
55276	55283	55284	55284	she	49	“ You ’re playing with me , ”
55288	55294	55284	55284	she	49	“ You ’re manipulating me . ”
55295	55331	55265	55265	She	49	“ I ’m not . I ’m giving you the truth , even though it ’s not what you want to hear . You told me you would n’t push . Did you mean it ? ”
55352	55355	55343	55343	she	49	“ Yes . ”
55356	55381	55340	55340	her	49	“ Good . Let ’s have some wine and dinner . Afterward , if you ’d really like to play , let me know . ”
55382	55387	55343	55343	she	49	“ Play ? How ? ”
55388	55399	55340	55340	her	49	“ I have some silk cord I bought for you . ”
55404	55408	55400	55400	Her	49	“ Silk cord ? ”
55409	55415	55416	55416	I	46	“ Crimson , of course . ”
55441	55471	55430	55430	I	46	“ I ’d like to tie you down when you ’re ready for that . If not tonight , then someday . I wo n’t push you , either . ”
55556	55563	55548	55548	Eva	49	“ When did you buy that ? ”
55564	55589	55590	55590	I	46	“ A week ago . Maybe two . I had no expectation of using it soon , but you made me want to today . ”
55603	55617	55590	55590	I	46	“ That said , I ’m perfectly happy with just fucking you hard . ”
55647	55659	55634	55634	She	49	“ Because you ’re mad at me for talking to Chris . ”
55660	55668	55627	55627	she	49	“ I told you I was n’t . ”
55669	55677	55634	55634	She	49	“ You were furious when we left . ”
55678	55683	55684	55684	I	46	“ Furiously turned on . ”
55688	55703	55684	55684	I	46	“ I ca n’t explain why , because I do n’t understand it myself . ”
55704	55707	55634	55634	She	49	“ Try . ”
55722	55774	55708	55708	I	46	“ I see you angry , passionate , ready to fight , and I want all that violence trapped beneath me . You make me want to hold you down , clawing and screaming , your cunt milking my cock as I pound it into you . Mine . All mine . ”
55775	55778	55779	55779	She	49	“ Gideon . ”
55801	55814	55708	55708	I	46	“ How come you never told Chris about what happened with Hugh ? ”
55864	55872	55855	55855	I	46	“ Why are we discussing this again ? ”
55899	55907	55873	55873	Eva	49	“ We did n’t talk about it . ”
55908	55927	55873	55873	Eva	49	“ Did n’t we ? In any case , it does n’t matter . My mother told him . ”
55954	55961	55932	55932	She	49	“ I do n’t think so . ”
55972	55978	55962	55962	I	46	“ She did , Eva . ”
55979	55987	55988	55988	She	49	“ Do you know that for sure ? ”
55995	55998	55962	55962	I	46	“ Yes . ”
55999	56002	55962	55962	I	46	“ How ? ”
56003	56022	55962	55962	I	46	“ They discussed it at the dinner table one night , something I do n’t want to do . ”
56023	56032	56033	56033	She	49	“ He acted like he did n’t know . ”
56049	56057	56033	56033	She	49	“ He seemed genuinely confused and horrified . ”
56058	56075	55962	55962	I	46	“ Then he ’s as conveniently obtuse as my mother . You should n’t be surprised . ”
56076	56084	56033	56033	She	49	“ What if he did n’t know ? ”
56085	56089	56090	56090	I	46	“ So what ? ”
56108	56132	56090	56090	I	46	“ What the fuck does it matter now ? It ’s done , Eva . Done and over with . Let it go . ”
56133	56140	56033	56033	She	49	“ Why are you so mad ? ”
56141	56175	56176	56176	I	46	“ Because I was settled in for the night with my wife . Dinner , wine , a little TV , a couple hours making love … after a long , rough day . ”
56181	56193	56176	56176	I	46	“ Forget it . I ’ll see you in the morning . ”
56194	56199	56200	56200	She	895	“ Gideon , wait . ”
56205	56219	56200	56200	She	895	“ Do n’t go to bed pissed . Please . I ’m sorry . ”
56230	56234	56220	56220	I	46	“ So am I. ”
56235	56240	56241	56241	he	46	“ START out slow , ”
56318	56325	56326	56326	he	46	“ You ’re thinking too much , ”
56330	56375	56376	56376	His	46	“ Concentrate on how good it feels . Look at that woman in front of you . She wants you to fuck her . Imagine how it ’d feel to push your cock into her . Soft . Hot . Wet . And tight . ”
56383	56387	56376	56376	His	46	“ So tight . ”
56541	56546	56547	56547	he	116	“ That ’s it , ”
56592	56596	56597	56597	I	46	“ Do n’t , ”
56603	56608	56609	56609	he	116	“ You like it , ”
56618	56658	56609	56609	he	116	“ You shoot off like a geyser every time . It ’s okay . It ’s supposed to feel good . You ’ll be better once you ’ve come . You wo n’t fight with your mother so much … ”
56659	56669	56670	56670	He	116	“ No . Do n’t ! Oh , God … ”
56845	56851	56852	56852	I	46	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
57198	57201	57202	57202	I	46	“ Gideon . ”
57266	57269	57270	57270	she	49	“ Hey , ”
57294	57299	57270	57270	she	49	“ Are you okay ? ”
57379	57388	57389	57389	She	49	“ No , angel , I ’m not . ”
57408	57415	57404	57404	I	46	“ I ’m sorry , Eva . ”
57476	57481	57482	57482	My	46	“ I ’m afraid . ”
57509	57518	57504	57504	she	49	“ Do n’t be . I ’m here . ”
57519	57525	57526	57526	I	46	“ I ’ll try harder , ”
57529	57537	57526	57526	I	46	“ Do n’t give up on me . ”
57538	57541	57542	57542	She	49	“ Gideon . ”
57552	57580	57542	57542	She	49	“ I love you so much . I just want you to be happy . I ’m sorry for pushing you after I said I would n’t . ”
57581	57600	57545	57545	her	49	“ It ’s my fault . I fucked up . I ’m sorry , Eva . So sorry . ”
57601	57611	57542	57542	She	49	“ Shh . You do n’t have to apologize . ”
57694	57699	57700	57700	she	49	“ I love you , ”
57703	57709	57700	57700	she	49	“ I ’ll never stop . ”
57765	57768	57757	57757	her	49	“ Angel ? ”
57784	57793	57780	57780	she	49	“ Let ’s make today our best ever . ”
57798	57807	57794	57794	I	46	“ I ’m on board with that plan . ”
57852	57856	57857	57857	She	49	“ Ave Maria . ”
57869	57872	57857	57857	She	49	“ Okay ? ”
57955	57962	57963	57963	I	46	“ God , you ’re beautiful , ”
58028	58033	58034	58034	she	49	“ I love you , ”
58079	58086	58087	58087	I	46	“ Tell me what you need , ”
58101	58107	58087	58087	I	46	“ You . Just you . ”
58108	58114	58115	58115	I	46	“ Take me , then , ”
58119	58124	58115	58115	I	46	“ I ’m yours . ”
58125	58140	58141	58141	Arash	0	“ I hate to be the one to break it to you , Cross , ”
58159	58173	58141	58141	Arash	0	“ but you ’ve lost your killer instinct . Eva ’s tamed you . ”
58214	58241	58174	58174	I	46	“ Just because I do n’t think LanCorp ’s PhazeOne gaming system is a threat to the GenTen does n’t mean I ’m not paying attention . ”
58242	58247	58248	58248	he	0	“ You ’re aware , ”
58251	58296	58248	58248	he	0	“ which is n’t the same as paying attention , and I guarantee Ryan Landon has noticed . You used to do something every week or two to poke at him , which — for better or worse — gave him something to do . ”
58297	58311	58174	58174	I	46	“ Was n’t it just last week that we closed the PosIT deal ? ”
58312	58330	58248	58248	he	0	“ That ’s reactive , Cross . You need to make a move he did n’t prompt . ”
58359	58366	58353	58353	I	46	“ I have to take this . ”
58367	58373	58374	58374	he	0	“ Of course you do , ”
58387	58394	58377	58377	I	46	“ Ireland , how are you ? ”
58433	58447	58448	58448	Her	365	“ Hey , sorry to call you in the middle of the day . ”
58458	58463	58453	58453	I	46	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
58467	58476	58464	58464	Ireland	89	“ Maybe now ’s not a good time . ”
58516	58521	58503	58503	I	46	“ You sound upset . ”
58522	58527	58528	58528	she	365	“ So do you , ”
58532	58556	58503	58503	I	46	“ You can call Eva and complain about it to her . She ’ll sympathize . Now , tell me what ’s wrong . ”
58560	58615	58557	58557	She	365	“ Mom and Dad were fighting all night . I do n’t know what about , but Dad was yelling . He never yells , you know that . He ’s the most laid - back guy ever . Nothing gets to him . And Mom hates fighting . She ’s a conflict avoider . ”
58624	58634	58616	58616	Her	365	“ I ’m sorry you had to hear that . ”
58635	58667	58557	58557	She	365	“ Dad took off early this morning and Mom ’s been crying ever since . Do you know what ’s going on ? Is it about Eva and you getting married ? ”
58695	58705	58688	58688	I	46	“ That probably has something to do with it . ”
58761	58774	58750	58750	I	46	“ Is there a friend you can stay with over the weekend ? ”
58775	58778	58815	58815	He	339	“ You . ”
58784	58792	58750	58750	I	46	“ You want to stay with me ? ”
58793	58804	58750	58750	I	46	“ Why not ? I ’ve never seen your place . ”
58864	58868	58869	58869	she	49	“ Never mind , ”
58872	58876	58869	58869	she	49	“ Forget it . ”
58877	58882	58840	58850	The only person who ’d ever spent the night with me	919	“ No , wait . ”
58886	58909	58840	58850	The only person who ’d ever spent the night with me	919	“ Eva and I have plans with friends tonight , that ’s all . I ’ll need some time to change them . ”
58910	58915	58916	58916	Her	49	“ Oh , gotcha . ”
58920	58946	58916	58916	Her	49	“ I do n’t want to fuck up your plans . I ’ve got some friends I can call . Do n’t worry about it . ”
58947	58968	58840	58850	The only person who ’d ever spent the night with me	919	“ I ’m worried about you . Eva and I can make some adjustments ; it ’s not a problem . ”
58969	58978	58979	58979	she	49	“ I ’m not a kid , Gideon , ”
58985	59025	58979	58979	she	49	“ I do n’t want to hang around your place knowing you and Eva were supposed to be out having fun . That would totally suck , so no thanks . I ’d rather chill with my own friends . ”
59031	59039	59028	59028	my	46	“ How about dinner on Saturday instead ? ”
59040	59054	58979	58979	she	49	“ Yeah ? I ’m down . Can I stay the night then ? ”
59079	59092	59067	59067	I	46	“ That can be arranged . Will you be okay until then ? ”
59093	59100	59101	59101	She	49	“ Jeez , listen to you . ”
59104	59151	59101	59101	She	49	“ You sound like a big brother . I ’ll be fine . It was just weird , you know , hearing them going at it . It freaked me out . Most people are probably used to their parents fighting , but I ’m not . ”
59152	59163	59164	59164	I	46	“ They ’ll be fine . All couples fight eventually . ”
59332	59342	59314	59314	I	46	“ You look like a bad , bad girl . ”
59356	59360	59343	59343	She	49	“ I am . ”
59361	59365	59314	59314	I	46	“ Come here . ”
59370	59391	59366	59366	She	49	“ I do n’t think so . You ’ve got the fuck - me look and we have to go . ”
59392	59415	59424	59424	she	49	“ We can be a little late . What would it take to talk you into wearing those shorts just for me ? ”
59446	59454	59438	59438	Her	49	“ We could renegotiate the hand job . ”
59510	59526	59506	59506	I	46	“ Put on a skirt , angel , and let ’s get this party started . ”
59527	59533	59534	59534	Arash	0	“ WAS this your idea ? ”
59608	59624	59577	59579	Two more bouncers	929	“ It ’s as much of a surprise to me as it is to you . ”
59625	59632	59633	59633	Eva	49	“ I meant to tell you . ”
59640	59657	59633	59633	Eva	49	“ Shawna ’s heard good things about this place and I thought it ’d be fun . ”
59658	59663	59664	59664	Shawna	483	“ Great reviews online , ”
59667	59678	59664	59664	Shawna	483	“ and some of my regulars were raving about it . ”
59732	59739	59740	59740	He	483	“ Stick with me , kid . ”
59747	59757	59740	59740	He	483	“ We ’ll show ’em how it ’s done . ”
59763	59769	59758	59758	Eva	49	“ Your surprise is here . ”
59817	59820	59821	59821	I	46	“ Maggie , ”
59837	59844	59821	59821	I	46	“ I ’m glad you came . ”
59917	59930	59914	59914	Maggie	170	“ Gideon . Eva . This is my boyfriend , Gage Flynn . ”
60009	60017	60018	60018	Eva	49	“ And here ’s Will and Natalie , ”
60112	60122	60104	60105	My wife	252	“ Do n’t tell me you own this place . ”
60123	60130	60104	60105	My wife	252	“ Okay , I wo n’t . ”
60131	60137	60104	60105	My wife	252	“ You mean you do ? ”
60196	60212	60213	60213	I	46	“ You need to decide if you want me to answer the question or not , ”
60274	60286	60287	60287	Arash	0	“ Is there anything you do n’t own in New York ? ”
60290	60304	60287	60287	Arash	0	“ He does n’t own the D’Argos Regal on Thirty - sixth anymore . ”
60342	60350	60332	60332	Eva	49	“ You got rid of the hotel ? ”
60411	60415	60416	60416	he	0	“ And suddenly , ”
60419	60425	60416	60416	he	0	“ it all makes sense . ”
60427	60436	60437	60437	Shawna	483	“ GOD , THOSE TWO are so sweet , ”
60445	60451	60437	60437	Shawna	483	“ I Got You , Babe ”
60456	60463	60464	60464	Manuel	100	“ They ’re giving me diabetes . ”
60470	60481	60464	60464	Manuel	100	“ Excuse me , everyone . I see something interesting . ”
60493	60509	60482	60482	Gideon	339	“ Say good - bye , angel . We wo n’t be seeing him again . ”
60529	60534	60535	60535	I	46	“ Bye , Manuel ! ”
60557	60569	60543	60543	I	46	“ How come all the guys you work with are hot ? ”
60570	60574	60575	60575	he	100	“ Are they ? ”
60589	60601	60575	60575	he	100	“ Maybe they wo n’t be working with me much longer . ”
60602	60606	60607	60607	I	46	“ Oh God . ”
60615	60620	60607	60607	I	46	“ Whatever , caveman . ”
60704	60717	60718	60718	she	77	“ When are you getting up there to make fools of yourselves ? ”
60721	60726	60718	60718	she	77	“ Um … never . ”
60759	60766	60769	60769	he	416	“ Only the Good Die Young , ”
60777	60789	60790	60790	She	77	“ ( I ’ve Had ) The Time of My Life . ”
60840	60846	60847	60847	Steven	328	“ Come on , Eva , ”
60850	60861	60847	60847	Steven	328	“ You picked this place . You have to sing . ”
60862	60869	60870	60870	I	46	“ Your sister picked this place , ”
60883	60889	60890	60890	he	328	“ She ’s sung twice ! ”

64318	64321	64322	64322	I	46	“ MORE , ”
64354	64370	64337	64337	Bacon	184	“ And here I ’d thought two packs of bacon would last us all weekend . ”
64371	64382	64383	64383	I	46	“ Grease is a must after a night of drinking , ”
64402	64413	64383	64383	I	46	“ When you ’re not hung over , that is . ”
64414	64419	64420	64420	Cary	483	“ Which I am , ”
64442	64447	64433	64433	he	483	“ Got any beer ? ”
64457	64461	64448	64448	Gideon	339	“ Bottom drawer . ”
64471	64479	64462	64462	I	46	“ Hair of the dog this morning ? ”
64480	64495	64496	64496	Cary	483	“ Hell , yeah . My head feels like it ’s splitting in two . ”
64527	64533	64534	64534	I	46	“ How ’d you sleep ? ”
64620	64625	64612	64612	He	483	“ Like the dead . ”
64626	64633	64655	64655	Cary	483	“ Do you like the apartment ? ”
64634	64642	64612	64612	He	483	“ Of course . Who would n’t ? ”
64643	64651	64652	64652	I	46	“ Do you want to live there ? ”
64662	64682	64655	64655	Cary	483	“ Yeah , baby girl . It ’s a dream . Thank you for the pity fuck , Gideon . ”
64699	64711	64712	64712	he	623	“ There is neither pity nor fucking included in the offer , ”
64716	64723	64712	64712	he	623	“ Otherwise , you ’re welcome . ”
64729	64736	64724	64724	I	46	“ Yay ! I ’m stoked . ”
64770	64774	64775	64775	Cary	483	“ Come on , ”
64778	64787	64775	64775	Cary	483	“ I ’m fighting nausea as it is . ”
64793	64797	64788	64788	I	46	“ Shut up . ”
64805	64837	64798	64798	He	483	“ Got ta give you guys a hard time . Who else is going to stop you two from singing ‘ I Got You , Babe ’ in a few years ? ”
64869	64883	64859	64859	I	46	“ Are n’t they adorable ? They ’ve been together since high school . ”
64884	64889	64890	64890	he	483	“ Exactly my point , ”
64893	64920	64890	64890	he	483	“ Spend enough years with someone and either you start bickering or you fall down the lovey - dovey hole , never to be seen again . ”
64921	64933	64934	64934	I	46	“ Mark and Steven have been together for years , too , ”
64937	64948	64934	64934	I	46	“ They do n’t fight or moon at each other . ”
64955	64971	64949	64949	He	483	“ They ’re gay , Eva . No estrogen in the mix to cause drama . ”
64972	64988	64934	64934	I	46	“ Oh my God . You sexist pig ! You did not just say that . ”
64994	65001	64989	64989	Cary	483	“ You know I ’m right . ”
65002	65007	65008	65008	Gideon	339	“ And with that , ”
65017	65022	65008	65008	Gideon	339	“ I ’m out . ”
65023	65026	65027	65027	I	46	“ Hey ! ”
65045	65059	65040	65042	My best friend	416	“ Do n’t worry . He hitched himself to your brand of female . ”
65072	65088	65060	65060	I	46	“ I ’m giving you a pass , because I owe you for last night . ”
65089	65099	65100	65100	His	483	“ It was fun . Megumi ’s good people . ”
65108	65120	65100	65100	His	483	“ I ’m sorry she ’s going through what she is . ”
65121	65128	65060	65060	I	46	“ Yeah , me , too . ”
65129	65145	65100	65100	His	483	“ You make any decisions about how you ’re going to help others like her ? ”
65154	65169	65146	65146	I	46	“ I ’m going to talk to Gideon about working with his Crossroads Foundation . ”
65170	65182	65060	65060	I	46	“ Hell . Why did n’t you think of that before ? ”
65183	65193	65194	65194	I	46	“ Because … I ’m stubborn , I guess . ”
65209	65240	65194	65194	I	46	“ One of the things Gideon likes about me is that I do n’t always do everything he wants just because he wants it . He ’s not like Stanton . ”
65241	65263	65060	65060	I	46	“ And you do n’t want to be like your mom . Does this mean you ’re keeping your maiden name ? ”
65264	65289	65194	65194	I	46	“ No way . It means a lot to Gideon for me to become Eva Cross . Besides , it sounds kick - ass . ”
65290	65294	65295	65295	He	46	“ It does . ”
65306	65317	65295	65295	He	46	“ I ’m here for you when you need me . ”
65327	65331	65323	65323	I	46	“ Same goes . ”
65332	65343	65344	65344	His	46	“ I ’m taking you up on that , obviously . ”
65352	65365	65344	65344	His	46	“ Big changes happening , baby girl . You ever get scared ? ”
65385	65394	65366	65366	I	46	“ More than I let myself think about . ”
65395	65404	65405	65405	Gideon	339	“ I have to run to the office , ”
65448	65455	65445	65445	his	46	“ I wo n’t be long . ”
65456	65462	65463	65463	I	46	“ Is everything all right ? ”
65497	65502	65503	65503	He	623	“ Everything ’s fine . ”
65514	65534	65503	65503	He	623	“ I ’ll be back in a couple of hours . Ireland wo n’t be here ’ til six . ”
65640	65649	65650	65650	Cary	483	“ I ’m gon na take a shower , ”
65662	65674	65650	65650	Cary	483	“ You want to watch a movie when I get out ? ”
65675	65678	65679	65679	I	46	“ Sure , ”
65683	65689	65679	65679	I	46	“ Sounds like a plan . ”
65710	65715	65679	65679	I	46	“ WHERE ’S EVA ? ”
65779	65784	65785	65785	I	46	“ At our home , ”
65797	65806	65785	65785	I	46	“ Let ’s go up to my office . ”
65811	65820	65807	65807	Kline	47	“ You ca n’t keep me from her . ”
65821	65829	65830	65830	I	46	“ You did that all by yourself . ”
65935	65945	65946	65946	he	114	“ You ca n’t intimidate me with your money , ”
65963	65991	65950	65950	I	46	“ There are eyes and ears all over the city . At least in my office , I know we wo n’t be putting on a show . ”
65998	66009	65992	65992	His	114	“ Is that all you care about ? Public perception ? ”
66010	66024	65992	65992	His	114	“ An ironic question , considering who you are and what you want . ”
66025	66034	66035	66035	he	114	“ Do n’t act like you know me , ”
66038	66043	66035	66035	he	114	“ You know shit . ”
66248	66258	66259	66259	he	1046	“ Does she know we ’re meeting like this ? ”
66263	66280	66259	66259	he	1046	“ I figured I ’d leave it up to you to decide whether to mention it . ”
66281	66291	66259	66259	he	1046	“ Oh , I ’m mentioning it all right . ”
66292	66298	66259	66259	he	1046	“ I hope you do . ”
66414	66437	66410	66410	He	47	“ What the fuck is this about ? I come into town to see Eva and your goon brings me here instead . ”
66439	66441	66450	66450	he	47	“ goon ”
66462	66493	66456	66457	the man	47	“ I ’m prepared to offer you a great deal of money — along with other incentives — for the exclusive rights to the Yimara footage of you and Eva . ”
66501	66527	66494	66494	He	47	“ Sam told me you were going to try this . That tape is none of your business . It ’s between me and Eva . ”
66528	66557	66619	66619	He	46	“ And the entire world if it leaks , and that would destroy her . Does that matter to you at all , how she feels about it ? ”
66558	66589	66494	66494	He	47	“ It ’s not going to leak , and of course I give a shit about how she feels . It ’s one of the reasons we need to talk . ”
66593	66618	66590	66590	I	46	“ You want to ask her what you can use . You think you can talk her into letting you exploit some of it . ”
66635	66648	66649	66649	I	46	“ You ’re not going to get the answer you hope for , ”
66653	66672	66649	66649	I	46	“ The very existence of that tape horrifies her . You ’re an idiot if you think otherwise . ”
66673	66707	66619	66619	He	46	“ It ’s not all sex . There ’s some good stuff of us hanging out . Her and I , we had something . She was n’t just a lay to me . ”
66725	66771	66722	66722	He	46	“ Not that you ’d understand . You had no problem banging away at that brunette until I came back into the picture , then you changed up your game . Eva ’s a toy you got bored with . Until someone else wanted her . ”
66817	66826	66810	66810	he	46	“ Eva knows what she means to me . ”
66834	66865	66827	66827	He	46	“ She ’s too blinded by your billions to realize there ’s something really wrong with you hiding that bogus wedding in a foreign country . Is it even legal ? ”
66874	66878	66870	66870	I	46	“ Absolutely legal . ”
67042	67050	67051	67051	I	46	“ So you and Eva are done , ”
67055	67095	67051	67051	I	46	“ If you doubted it , now you know it for sure . In any case , I do n’t think you want my wife as much as you want the memory of her for the band ’s use . ”
67099	67133	67096	67096	Kline	47	“ Yeah , paint me as the sleaze . You ca n’t handle the thought of her seeing that tape . You ’ve never made her get that wild and you never will . ”
67149	67179	67134	67134	My	46	“ Believe what you like . Here are your options : You can take the two million I ’m offering , give me the footage , and walk away — ”
67180	67189	67191	67191	his	47	“ I do n’t want your damn money ! ”
67205	67237	67200	67200	he	47	“ You do n’t get to own my memories . You may have her — for now — but I have those . Fuck if I ’m selling them to you . ”
67298	67331	67291	67291	my	46	“ You can reject the money and keep the existence of the footage to yourself until you die . Make it a secret gift to Eva she never has to know about . ”
67332	67341	67291	67291	my	46	“ What the fuck are you talking about ? ”
67342	67351	67352	67352	I	46	“ Or you can be a selfish asshole , ”
67355	67378	67352	67352	I	46	“ and hit her up with it , shocking her with the goal of destroying her marriage and making yourself more famous . ”
67426	67451	67417	67417	I	46	“ If you care about her at all , you ’ll make a different decision than the one that brought you to New York . ”
67473	67483	67452	67452	He	47	“ I ’m not leaving until I see her . ”
67510	67518	67501	67501	I	46	“ Did I give you enough time ? ”
67519	67640	67641	67641	Ice	187	“ Yes . We took care of the laptop and tablet in his luggage as soon as you took him upstairs . We ’re handling his e - mail and backup provider servers as we speak , and the backups to those servers . We searched his residence over the weekend , but he has n’t been there in weeks . We cleaned everything on both Yimara and Kline ’s equipment , as well as the accounts and equipment of those who received teasers of the full - length footage . One of the execs at Vidal had a full copy on his hard drive , but we wiped it . We found no evidence that he forwarded it anywhere . ”
67647	67651	67641	67641	Ice	187	“ Which executive ? ”
67652	67656	67641	67641	Ice	187	“ Your brother . ”
67764	67775	67753	67753	I	46	“ I need that footage to cease to exist anywhere . ”
67776	67827	67832	67832	I	46	“ Understood . We ’re on it . Still , it ’s possible there ’s a hard copy floating around , although we ’ve searched Kline and Yimara ’s transaction records for security deposit boxes and the like . We ’ll continue to monitor the situation until you say otherwise . ”
67859	67863	67891	67891	she	49	“ Thank you . ”
67877	67884	67885	67885	Ireland	89	“ YOU’RE really good with those , ”
67907	67916	67891	67891	she	49	“ I never got the hang of ’em . ”
67917	67926	67891	67891	she	49	“ Here , try holding them like this . ”
68180	68187	68188	68188	Ireland	89	“ Ha ! Look at that , ”
68205	68212	68188	68188	Ireland	89	“ Made it to my mouth . ”
68252	68264	68265	68265	Ireland	89	“ The chopsticks have a large target . Ups your chances . ”
68302	68312	68285	68285	They	1074	“ Did you just call me a big mouth ? ”
68348	68353	68354	68354	I	46	“ Not my words , ”
68357	68364	68365	68365	she	1070	“ Not in so many words , ”
68455	68462	68463	68463	Ireland	89	“ Channing Tatum is so hot , ”
68474	68480	68463	68463	Ireland	89	“ Do n’t you think ? ”
68566	68574	68575	68575	Eva	49	“ He ’s very good - looking , ”
68601	68611	68612	68612	Ireland	89	“ He ’s this year ’s Sexiest Man Alive , ”
68615	68621	68612	68612	Ireland	89	“ Look at those biceps . ”
68622	68640	68681	68681	Ireland	89	“ Ah , now on that , I have to totally disagree . Gideon is way sexier . ”
68645	68652	68653	68654	my sister	365	“ You ’re such a goner , ”
68657	68675	68653	68654	my sister	365	“ Your pupils turn into little hearts when you think about Gideon . It ’s so cute . ”
68676	68680	68681	68681	Ireland	89	“ Shut up . ”
68690	68727	68681	68681	Ireland	89	“ Do n’t worry . He ’s goofy over you , too . And he ’s been on every Sexiest Man Alive list for ages . I never hear the end of it from my friends . ”
68728	68745	68653	68654	my sister	365	“ Gah . Do n’t tell me stuff like that . I ’m jealous by nature . ”
68759	68793	68681	68681	Ireland	89	“ So is Gideon . He ’s going to flip out when you start hitting the Hottest Women Alive lists . No way to avoid it now that everyone ’s heard of you . ”
68794	68797	68798	68798	Eva	49	“ Whatever , ”
68801	68818	68798	68798	Eva	49	“ They ’d have to Photoshop fifteen pounds off my ass and thighs to sell that . ”
68819	68832	68880	68880	Ireland	89	“ Um , have you seen Kim Kardashian ? Or Jennifer Lopez ? ”
68892	68899	68900	68900	she	49	“ What did I tell you ? ”
68903	68906	68900	68900	she	49	“ Goofy . ”
68939	68953	68900	68900	she	49	“ Dude . What the hell ? It ’s three in the morning . ”
68969	68973	68954	68954	I	46	“ Your point ? ”
68974	68982	68997	68997	her	49	“ Why are you working so late ? ”
68983	68991	68992	68992	I	46	“ Why are you Skyping so late ? ”
69016	69019	69020	69020	she	49	“ Whatev , ”
69058	69063	69038	69038	She	49	“ Ca n’t sleep ? ”
69064	69067	69068	69068	She	49	“ No . ”
69130	69138	69139	69139	she	49	“ Christopher texted me a bit ago , ”
69142	69151	69139	69139	she	49	“ Guess Dad ’s staying at a hotel . ”
69163	69186	69156	69156	She	49	“ It ’s bad , Gideon . They have n’t spent a night apart ever . At least that I can remember . ”
69310	69321	69322	69322	she	319	“ I just wish I knew what caused the fight , ”
69325	69350	69322	69322	she	319	“ I mean as long as they did n’t cheat on each other , they should be able to get through it , right ? ”
69357	69399	69354	69354	I	46	“ I ’m not the person to ask about relationships . I have no idea how they work . I ’m just stumbling my way through , praying not to fuck things up , and grateful that Eva is so forgiving . ”
69400	69406	69409	69409	her	319	“ You really love her . ”
69473	69476	69477	69477	I	46	“ Yes , ”
69508	69517	69518	69518	Ireland	89	“ I ’m happy for you , Gideon . ”
69526	69530	69534	69534	her	49	“ Thank you . ”
69557	69564	69565	69565	she	49	“ Could you talk to Mom ? ”
69568	69588	69565	69565	she	49	“ Not now , of course . But tomorrow ? Maybe you can find out what ’s going on ? ”
69606	69611	69589	69589	I	46	“ I ’ll try . ”
69617	69629	69612	69612	Ireland	89	“ You do n’t like Mom very much , do you ? ”
69638	69647	69635	69635	I	46	“ We have a fundamental difference of opinion . ”
69648	69716	69612	69612	Ireland	89	“ Yeah . I get it . It ’s like she ’s got this weird form of OCD that applies to her family . Everyone has to be a particular way or at least pretend to be . She ’s so worried about what people think . I saw an old movie the other day that reminded me of her . Ordinary People . Ever seen it ? ”
69717	69726	69635	69635	I	46	“ No , ca n’t say I have . ”
69727	69757	69612	69612	Ireland	89	“ You should watch it . It has Kiefer Sutherland ’s dad in it and some other people . It ’s sad , but it ’s a good story . ”
69758	69765	69635	69635	I	46	“ I ’ll look it up . ”
69779	69803	69774	69774	I	46	“ What she dealt with after my father died … It was brutal . She ’s insulated herself since then , I think . ”
69804	69828	69862	69862	Ireland	89	“ My friend ’s mother says Mom used to be different before . You know , when she was married to your dad . ”
69836	69843	69829	69829	I	46	“ I do remember her differently . ”
69844	69847	69862	69862	Ireland	89	“ Better ? ”
69848	69861	69829	69829	I	46	“ That ’s subjective . She was more … spontaneous . Carefree . ”
69871	69883	69862	69862	Ireland	89	“ Do you think it broke her ? Losing your dad ? ”
69888	69893	69894	69894	I	46	“ It changed her , ”
69898	69906	69894	69894	I	46	“ I ’m not sure how much . ”
69907	69910	69911	69911	She	89	“ Ugh . ”
69921	69929	69911	69911	She	89	“ You going to be awake awhile ? ”
69930	69935	69894	69894	I	46	“ Probably all night . ”
69936	69944	69911	69911	She	89	“ Wanna watch that movie with me ? ”
69954	69968	69952	69952	me	46	“ Depends . You ca n’t tell me what happens . No spoilers . ”
69975	69998	69969	69969	She	89	“ I already told you it ’s sad . If you want happily ever after , she ’s sleeping down the hall . ”
70011	70023	70006	70006	I	46	“ You find the movie , I ’ll grab the soda . ”
70024	70031	69969	69969	She	89	“ A beer would be good . ”
70032	70038	70006	70006	I	46	“ Not on my watch . ”
70048	70057	70039	70039	She	89	“ Okay , fine . Wine , then . ”
70058	70067	69969	69969	She	89	“ Ask me again in a few years . ”
70068	70083	70039	70039	She	89	“ You ’ll have kids by then . It wo n’t be as fun . ”
70138	70178	70135	70135	Ireland	89	“ Holy fuck , you should see your face ! A classic case of playboy panic . Did n’t they tell you ? First comes love , then comes marriage , then comes the baby in the baby carriage . ”
70179	70194	70195	70195	She	49	“ If you do n’t shut up , I ’m sending you to bed . ”
70205	70236	70195	70195	She	49	“ You ’re a riot . Seriously . I ’m just messing with you . Do n’t flip out on me . I ’ve got enough family members doing that . ”
70248	70256	70257	70257	she	49	“ Maybe you should have a drink , ”
70260	70266	70267	70267	I	46	“ I think I will , ”
70270	70300	70315	70315	she	49	“ I ’m going to give major props to Eva for getting a ring out of you . Did you have a panic attack when you proposed , too ? ”
70301	70307	70315	70315	she	49	“ Stop talking , Ireland . ”
70528	70535	70536	70536	she	49	“ Hard and yummy all over , ”
70539	70543	70544	70544	I	46	“ All over , ”
70568	70575	70560	70560	Her	49	“ We have to be quiet . ”
70576	70583	70602	70602	She	49	“ I ’ll cover your mouth . ”
70584	70587	70588	70588	She	49	“ Me ? ”
70594	70601	70588	70588	She	49	“ You ’re the noisy one . ”
70651	70659	70660	70660	I	46	“ So we ’ll take it slow , ”
70672	70685	70660	70660	I	46	“ Ireland will be sleeping for hours ; there ’s no rush . ”
70686	70691	70694	70694	she	49	“ Hours , huh ? ”
70709	70712	70694	70694	she	49	“ Overachiever . ”
70972	70977	70978	70978	I	46	“ Do n’t move , ”
71037	71045	71046	71046	I	46	“ I want you just like this , ”
71092	71095	71098	71098	she	49	“ Gideon … ”
71220	71223	71212	71212	she	49	“ God . ”
71273	71276	71251	71251	her	49	“ Angel — ”
71460	71463	71464	71464	I	46	“ Eva . ”
71472	71475	71464	71464	I	46	“ Crossfire . ”
71492	71495	71496	71496	she	49	“ Ace , ”
71502	71509	71496	71496	she	49	“ I love you , too . ”
71541	71549	71550	71550	Ireland	89	“ Aw , you drove too fast , ”
71556	71562	71550	71550	Ireland	89	“ We ’re here already . ”
71676	71685	71686	71686	Ireland	89	“ I want to stay over again sometime , ”
71698	71705	71686	71686	Ireland	89	“ It was fun , right ? ”
71711	71718	71706	71706	I	46	“ We ’ll do it again . ”
71719	71722	71706	71706	I	46	“ Soon ? ”
71723	71727	71706	71706	I	46	“ All right . ”
71806	71815	71816	71816	I	46	“ You ’ll have to help me out , ”
71821	71842	71816	71816	I	46	“ I do n’t know how to be a brother . You will probably have to forgive me . Frequently . ”
71860	71870	71871	71871	she	49	“ Well , it ’s like being a friend , ”
71875	71907	71871	71871	she	49	“ Except you have to remember birthdays and holidays , you have to forgive me for everything , and you should introduce me to all your hot , rich guy friends . ”
71912	71929	71908	71908	My	46	“ Where ’s the part about me picking on you and giving you a hard time ? ”
71930	71936	71937	71937	she	49	“ You missed those years , ”
71941	71947	71937	71937	she	49	“ No do - overs . ”
71971	71981	71982	71982	Eva	49	“ You get to pick on her boyfriends instead , ”
71985	71993	71982	71982	Eva	49	“ and give them a hard time . ”
72089	72122	72082	72082	Ireland	89	“ I wish you guys did n’t have to work tomorrow . I mean , what ’s the point of being a gazillionaire if you ca n’t play hooky when you want ? ”
72123	72130	72131	72131	I	46	“ If Eva worked with me , ”
72139	72143	72131	72131	I	46	“ we could . ”
72150	72155	72144	72144	She	252	“ Do n’t start . ”
72168	72174	72156	72156	I	46	“ I have n’t stopped . ”
72255	72260	72261	72261	she	252	“ I love you , ”
72267	72274	72261	72261	she	252	“ Thanks for having me over . ”
72370	72378	72365	72365	I	46	“ Get in the car , angel . ”
72413	72416	72417	72417	She	319	“ Gideon . ”
72436	72451	72417	72417	She	319	“ Wo n’t you and Eva come in ? You drove all this way . ”
72462	72470	72452	72452	I	46	“ And we have to drive back . ”
72477	72540	72471	72471	Her	319	“ Just for a few minutes . Please . I ’d like to apologize to both of you . I have n’t handled the news of your engagement well and I ’m sorry about that . This should be a happy time for our family , and I ’m afraid I ’ve been too worried about losing my son to appreciate it . ”
72541	72544	72545	72545	I	46	“ Mom . ”
72557	72561	72545	72545	I	46	“ Not now . ”
72562	72620	72471	72471	Her	319	“ I did n’t mean all those things I said about Eva the other day . It was just a shock , seeing the ring your father gave me on another woman ’s hand . You did n’t give the ring to Corinne , so I was surprised . You can understand that , ca n’t you ? ”
72621	72626	72545	72545	I	46	“ You antagonized Eva . ”
72627	72635	72636	72636	She	319	“ Is that what she told you ? ”
72639	72664	72636	72636	She	319	“ I never meant to , but — Never mind . Your father was very protective , too . You ’re so like him . ”
72707	72746	72747	72747	She	319	“ Gideon … please , I ’m trying . I said some things to Eva I should n’t have , and she responded as any woman would under the circumstances . I just want to smooth things over . ”
72755	72787	72747	72747	She	319	“ I ’m happy for you , Gideon . And I ’m so glad to see you and Ireland spending time together . I know it means so much to her . ”
72795	72842	72788	72788	I	46	“ It means a lot to me , too . And Eva made it possible in ways I wo n’t explain . Which is just one of the reasons I wo n’t have her upset . Not now . She has to work in the morning . ”
72843	72858	72747	72747	She	319	“ Let ’s make plans for lunch this week , then . Or dinner . ”
72859	72865	72866	72866	Eva	49	“ Will Chris be there ? ”
72945	72956	72939	72940	My mother	46	“ Of course . Chris and I are a team . ”
72979	72995	72976	72976	I	46	“ We ’ll make plans . Call Scott tomorrow and we ’ll work something out . ”
73002	73011	72996	72997	My mother	46	“ I ’m so glad . Thank you . ”
73122	73131	73113	73113	We	1127	“ When did your mother talk to you ? ”
73156	73167	73148	73148	I	46	“ I do n’t want you worrying about my mother . ”
73168	73201	73141	73141	her	46	“ You do n’t want me worrying about anything ! That ’s not the way this is gon na work . You do n’t get to deal with all the crap alone . ”
73202	73226	73148	73148	I	46	“ What my mother says or does is n’t important , Eva . I do n’t give a shit and neither should you . ”
73236	73262	73227	73227	She	46	“ You need to start sharing stuff . Especially things that have to do with me , like your mother saying things behind my back ! ”
73263	73277	73282	73282	I	46	“ I wo n’t have you getting pissed off over an irrelevant opinion . ”
73289	73302	73303	73303	she	46	“ That would be better than me getting pissed off at you ! ”
73306	73310	73303	73303	she	46	“ Pull over . ”
73311	73314	73315	73315	I	46	“ What ? ”
73320	73327	73303	73303	she	46	“ Pull the damn car over ! ”
73343	73348	73331	73331	I	46	“ Tell me why . ”
73349	73374	73303	73303	she	46	“ Because I ’m mad at you , and you ’re sitting there looking all hot and sexy driving and you need to stop . ”
73380	73392	73331	73331	I	46	“ Stop what ? Looking hot and sexy ? Or driving ? ”
73393	73403	73331	73331	I	46	“ Gideon … do n’t push me right now . ”
73421	73424	73406	73406	I	46	“ Better ? ”
73447	73452	73453	73453	she	46	“ I ’m driving , ”
73464	73474	73453	73453	she	46	“ At least until we get to the city . ”
73475	73483	73453	73453	she	46	“ If that ’s what you want . ”
73555	73564	73565	73565	she	46	“ Do n’t look at me like that , ”
73568	73572	73573	73573	I	46	“ Like what ? ”
73627	73640	73641	73641	Her	252	“ Like I ’m a ticking time bomb ready to go off ! ”
73645	73652	73641	73641	Her	252	“ I am not being irrational . ”
73653	73666	73599	73599	she	252	“ Angel , that ’s not the look I ’m giving you . ”
73667	73678	73679	73679	she	46	“ And do n’t try to distract me with sex , ”
73687	73698	73679	73679	she	46	“ Or you wo n’t get any for a week ! ”
73705	73739	73699	73699	My	46	“ We ’ve already talked about issuing ultimatums like that . You can bitch at me all you like , Eva , but I ’ll have you when I want you . Period . ”
73740	73748	73679	73679	she	46	“ Never mind whether I want you ? ”
73749	73763	73764	73764	I	46	“ Asks the wife who gets wet watching me drive a damn car , ”
73771	73785	73767	73767	Her	46	“ I may just leave you here on the side of the road . ”
73806	73814	73815	73815	I	46	“ You do n’t tell me everything , ”
73818	73834	73815	73815	I	46	“ What about Kline ? Has he completely stopped communicating with you since San Diego ? ”
73929	73943	73926	73926	She	49	“ Oh my God . Have you been looking at my phone again ? ”
73944	73947	73948	73948	My	46	“ No . ”
73955	73964	73948	73948	My	46	“ I know how you feel about that . ”
74025	74075	74010	74010	Eva	49	“ Yes , Brett has sent me a few texts . I was going to talk to you about it , so do n’t even try to say it ’s the same thing . I totally intended to tell you . You had absolutely no intention of telling me . ”
74091	74104	74088	74088	her	49	“ Get in and drive . We ’ll talk in the car . ”
74263	74270	74271	74271	she	49	“ Are you listening to me ? ”
74274	74307	74255	74255	she	49	“ Not really , angel . And before you get more riled , it ’s entirely your fault . You ’re sitting there looking hot and sexy , and I ’m distracted . ”
74317	74324	74308	74308	Her	49	“ Seriously ? Stop cracking jokes ! ”
74325	74355	74308	74308	Her	49	“ I ’m not kidding . Eva … you want me to share , so you can support me . I get it . I ’m working on it . ”
74356	74362	74308	74308	Her	49	“ Not hard enough apparently . ”
74363	74381	74308	74308	Her	49	“ I ’m not going to share things that aggravate you unnecessarily . There ’s no point . ”
74382	74403	74308	74308	Her	49	“ We have to be straight with each other , Gideon . Not just occasionally , but all the time . ”
74404	74437	74308	74308	Her	49	“ Really ? I do n’t expect the same from you . For example , feel free to keep all the unflattering comments your father and Cary make about me to yourself . ”
74452	74471	74442	74442	She	1139	“ Using that logic , would n’t it be okay for me to not say anything about Brett ? ”
74472	74485	74308	74308	Her	49	“ No . Kline impacts our relationship . My mother does not . ”
74489	74496	74497	74497	I	46	“ I ’m right about this , ”
74501	74518	74497	74497	I	46	“ Are you telling me that your mom talking crap about me does n’t bother you ? ”
74519	74571	74442	74442	She	1139	“ I do n’t like it . That said , it does n’t change how I feel about you or her . And telling you wo n’t change your feelings about her , either . Since the result is the same either way , I choose the path of least disruption . ”
74572	74580	74497	74497	I	46	“ You ’re thinking like a guy . ”
74581	74587	74442	74442	She	1139	“ I should hope so . ”
74599	74617	74442	74442	She	1139	“ Do n’t let her cause trouble between us , angel . She ’s not worth it . ”
74623	74648	74618	74618	Eva	49	“ You ’re pretending that what your mom says and does has no effect on you , but I know that ’s not true . ”
74671	74680	74662	74663	my wife	252	“ I do n’t let it affect me . ”
74681	74707	74719	74719	Her	252	“ But it does . It hurts and you push it into that place where you push everything you do n’t want to deal with . ”
74708	74714	74715	74715	I	46	“ Do n’t analyze me , ”
74725	74737	74715	74715	I	46	“ I love you . I want to stop the pain . ”
74738	74743	74744	74744	I	46	“ You already have . ”
74749	74767	74744	74744	I	46	“ You ’ve given me everything she took away . Do n’t let her take any more . ”
74787	74791	74776	74776	Eva	49	“ Point taken . ”
74954	74960	74961	74961	I	46	“ Just enjoying the show , ”
75220	75227	75228	75228	he	1145	“ It ’s an interactive exhibition , ”
75237	75241	75228	75228	he	1145	“ Join me . ”
75242	75248	75249	75249	My	46	“ You ’re an animal . ”
75273	75278	75286	75286	He	1145	“ Only for you . ”
75279	75285	75286	75286	He	1145	“ Ooh , right answer . ”
75293	75299	75286	75286	He	1145	“ You should reward me . ”
75310	75319	75300	75300	I	46	“ How would you suggest I do that ? ”
75320	75326	75286	75286	He	1145	“ Any way you like . ”
75345	75373	75374	75374	I	46	“ I do n’t have enough time to do you justice , ace . I ’d hate to cut things short when they ’re just getting interesting . ”
75382	75405	75374	75374	I	46	“ How about we revisit after my workout tonight ? You , me , and whatever I want to do to you ? ”
75471	75479	75480	75480	he	46	“ I ’m all yours , angel , ”
75504	75507	75508	75508	I	46	“ Yes , ”
75511	75515	75508	75508	I	46	“ You are . ”
75606	75609	75610	75610	I	46	“ Jeez , ”
75649	75652	75653	75653	I	46	“ Hey , ”
75657	75660	75664	75664	Brett	47	“ Eva . ”
75718	75733	75778	75778	He	46	“ Damn it , I ’ve been trying to reach you for a week ! ”
75734	75751	75778	75778	He	46	“ I know . I ’m sorry , I ’ve been busy . How are you ? ”
75752	75764	75778	75778	He	46	“ I ’ve been better . I need to see you . ”
75769	75777	75765	75765	My	46	“ When are you coming to town ? ”
75792	75820	75778	75778	He	46	“ Incredible . Listen , I do n’t want to get into it on the phone . Can we get together today ? We need to talk . ”
75821	75836	75778	75778	He	46	“ You ’re in New York ? I thought you were on tour … ? ”
75876	75890	75891	75891	Brett	47	“ I ’ll tell you what ’s going on when I see you , ”
75936	75952	75980	75980	his	46	“ I ’m on my way to work . What ’s going on , Brett ? ”
75953	75970	75980	75980	his	46	“ I can meet you for lunch . Or after you get off for the day . ”
75986	75989	75971	75971	I	46	“ Okay . ”
76044	76061	76028	76028	I	46	“ I can see you at lunch , if we stick close to the Crossfire Building . ”
76062	76073	76092	76092	We	1155	“ All right . What time should I be there ? ”
76074	76091	76028	76028	I	46	“ A little before noon would be best . I ’ll meet you in the lobby . ”
76349	76356	76357	76357	I	46	“ There ’s nothing for him , ”
76366	76374	76357	76357	I	46	“ I ’m too filled with you . ”
76401	76405	76385	76385	He	46	“ Come here . ”
76458	76465	76452	76452	His	46	“ You okay , angel mine ? ”
76466	76481	76452	76452	His	46	“ I ’m in your arms . Life does n’t get better than this . ”
76523	76526	76527	76527	I	46	“ Vultures , ”
76530	76543	76527	76527	I	46	“ Ca n’t be helped that we ’re such a photogenic couple . ”
76544	76555	76578	76578	he	46	“ You ’re such a humble man , Gideon Cross . ”
76556	76566	76527	76527	I	46	“ You make me look good , Mrs. Cross . ”
76693	76698	76699	76699	she	77	“ Hey , you , ”
76712	76717	76699	76699	she	77	“ You look great . ”
76722	76734	76718	76718	Her	77	“ Thanks . How ’d it go with Gideon ’s sister ? ”
76735	76754	76718	76718	Her	77	“ Awesome . She ’s a lot of fun . It makes me melt seeing Gideon with her . ”
76755	76786	76718	76718	Her	77	“ He makes me melt , period . You lucky bitch . Anyway , I put a call through to your line earlier . They wanted to leave a message . ”
76797	76803	76787	76787	I	46	“ Was it a guy ? ”
76804	76810	76718	76718	Her	77	“ No , a woman . ”
76811	76823	76787	76787	I	46	“ Hmm , I ’ll go check it out , thanks . ”
77067	77075	77063	77063	His	47	“ What ’s got you so excited ? ”
77076	77114	77063	77063	His	47	“ A gal from LanCorp called this morning . They want to meet with us sometime this week to talk a bit more about what they ’re hoping to achieve with the launch of the PhazeOne system . ”
77157	77169	77149	77149	he	47	“ You and me , kid , we ’re going places . ”
77178	77204	77170	77170	I	46	“ Yeah . You ’ve got this . Once they meet with you in person , you ’ll have them eating out of your hand . ”
77208	77216	77205	77205	Mark	757	“ You ’re good for my confidence . ”
77222	77231	77217	77217	I	46	“ I ’m good for you , period . ”
77313	77341	77310	77310	I	46	“ Is it going to be a problem ? I mean , could LanCorp possibly see a conflict of interest with me working for you on this ? ”
77375	77435	77351	77351	He	757	“ It should n’t be an issue , no . If our proposed positioning wins out over the other RFPs they ’re collecting , the fact that you ’re engaged to Gideon Cross is n’t going to make a damn bit of difference . They ’re going to make their decision based on our ability to deliver their vision . ”
78097	78100	78082	78082	he	47	“ Eva . ”
78222	78233	78210	78210	Brett	47	“ Really ? Is this where we ’re at now ? ”
78234	78239	78240	78240	I	46	“ I ’m married , ”
78244	78252	78240	78240	I	46	“ Hugging each other is n’t appropriate . ”
78253	78270	78210	78210	Brett	47	“ What about the women he ’s tapped all over the tabloids ? That ’s okay ? ”
78271	78275	78276	78276	I	46	“ Come on , ”
78279	78293	78276	78276	I	46	“ You know you ca n’t always believe what the press feeds you . ”
78307	78321	78298	78298	He	47	“ You can believe what they say about how I feel about you . ”
78326	78333	78322	78322	My	46	“ I think you believe it . ”
78394	78402	78386	78386	Brett	47	“ Let ’s get out of here . ”
78453	78474	78446	78446	I	46	“ I had some sandwiches delivered a little bit ago . Figured that would give us more time to talk . ”
78817	78827	78828	78828	Brett	47	“ You got the wrong impression in San Diego , ”
78839	78847	78828	78828	Brett	47	“ Brittany is n’t a serious thing . ”
78848	78858	78828	78828	Brett	47	“ It ’s none of my business , Brett . ”
78859	78872	78828	78828	Brett	47	“ I miss you . Sometimes , she reminds me of you . ”
78891	78906	78883	78883	I	46	“ I could n’t go back to you , Brett . Not after Gideon . ”
78907	78913	78942	78942	Brett	47	“ You say that now . ”
78914	78934	78935	78935	I	46	“ He makes me feel like he ca n’t breathe without me . I could n’t settle for less . ”
78991	78996	78997	78997	he	47	“ Look at that , ”
79001	79012	78997	78997	he	47	“ and tell me we did n’t have something real . ”
79067	79074	79075	79075	I	46	“ Where did you get this ? ”
79120	79130	79131	79131	I	46	“ Sam took that after one of our sets . ”
79165	79172	79157	79157	I	46	“ Do you know about … ? ”
79213	79219	79210	79210	He	47	“ I ’ve seen it . ”
79220	79225	79226	79226	I	46	“ Oh my God . ”
79269	79272	79273	79273	He	47	“ Eva . ”
79278	79316	79273	79273	He	47	“ It ’s not what you think . Whatever Cross told you about the video , I promise it is n’t bad . A little raw sometimes , but that ’s the way it was between us . ”
79347	79367	79340	79340	I	46	“ How many people have seen it ? Have you shown it to — Has the band watched it ? ”
79382	79385	79386	79386	I	46	“ Jesus . ”
79390	79400	79386	79386	I	46	“ What do you want from me , Brett ? ”
79401	79405	79411	79411	he	47	“ I want — ”
79417	79440	79411	79411	he	47	“ Hell . I want you . I want us to be together . I do n’t think we ’re over yet . ”
79441	79447	79386	79386	I	46	“ We never got started . ”
79448	79468	79411	79411	he	47	“ I know that ’s my fault . I want you to give me a chance to fix it . ”
79472	79477	79469	79469	I	46	“ I ’m married ! ”
79478	79497	79386	79386	I	46	“ He ’s no good , Eva . You do n’t know him like you think you do . ”
79510	79529	79498	79498	My	46	“ I know he ’d never show footage of us to anyone ! He respects me too much . ”
79530	79553	79469	79469	I	46	“ The whole point was to document the rise of the band , Eva . We had to sort through it all . ”
79554	79563	79564	79564	I	46	“ You could ’ve watched it alone first , ”
79579	79592	79564	79564	I	46	“ You could ’ve cut us out before the others saw it . ”
79593	79613	79469	79469	I	46	“ We ’re not the only ones Sam got on video . The other guys had stuff , too . ”
79614	79618	79619	79619	I	46	“ Oh God . ”
79629	79638	79639	79639	I	46	“ And there were other girls with you , ”
79646	79659	79639	79639	I	46	“ What did it matter when I was just one of many . ”
79660	79664	79665	79665	He	46	“ It mattered . ”
79669	79712	79665	79665	He	46	“ It was different with you , Eva . I was different with you . I was just too young and full of myself to appreciate it at the time . You need to see , Eva . Then you ’ll understand . ”
79719	79734	79713	79713	I	46	“ I do n’t want to see it . Ever . Are you crazy ? ”
79751	79755	79756	79756	He	46	“ Goddamn it . ”
79768	79780	79756	79756	He	46	“ I did n’t want to talk about the fucking video . ”
79840	79846	79847	79847	I	46	“ What do you want ? ”
79851	79866	79847	79847	I	46	“ What was so damned urgent you had to come out to New York ? ”
80053	80056	80060	80061	my husband	623	“ Angel . ”
80097	80100	80073	80073	He	623	“ Gideon . ”
80176	80179	80180	80180	His	623	“ Shh . ”
80187	80193	80180	80180	His	623	“ I ’ve got you . ”
80310	80316	80317	80317	he	46	“ I ’ve got this , ”
80320	80324	80317	80317	he	46	“ Trust me . ”
80333	80345	80325	80325	I	46	“ They want to use the footage , do n’t they ? ”
80346	80355	80325	80325	I	46	“ They wo n’t . No one will . ”
80724	80727	80728	80728	I	46	“ Hey , ”
80732	80740	80728	80728	I	46	“ You keeping him out of trouble ? ”
80741	80747	80748	80749	the lawyer	303	“ When he lets me , ”
80767	80771	80772	80772	Gideon	339	“ Back off , ”
80786	80797	80783	80783	Arash	0	“ This new jealous streak of yours is vastly entertaining . ”
80798	80806	80807	80807	Gideon	339	“ Your sense of humor is not , ”
80844	80853	80854	80854	Arash	0	“ I ’ve got a meeting in thirty , ”
80857	80880	80854	80854	Arash	0	“ so I ’ll head out . Thanks for Friday night , Eva . I ’d love to do it again sometime . ”
80881	80885	80886	80886	I	46	“ We will , ”
80890	80894	80886	80886	I	46	“ For sure . ”
80906	80912	80896	80896	he	623	“ Can I hug you ? ”
80913	80920	80886	80886	I	46	“ You never have to ask . ”
80933	80939	80921	80921	My	46	“ The glass is clear . ”
80940	80945	80946	80946	he	623	“ Let them see , ”
80966	80973	80955	80955	He	623	“ Talk to me , angel . ”
80974	80982	80955	80955	He	623	“ I do n’t want to talk . ”
81007	81023	80955	80955	He	623	“ I want to hear your voice . Say anything , I do n’t care . ”
81024	81036	80955	80955	He	623	“ Kline wo n’t hurt you . I promise you that . ”
81042	81052	81037	81037	My	46	“ Not about him . Tell me about work . ”
81053	81056	80955	80955	He	623	“ Eva … ”
81076	81115	81073	81073	I	46	“ I just want to close my eyes for a minute and feel you . Smell you . Hear you . I need to just soak you in for a minute , and then I ’ll be okay . ”
81135	81172	81125	81125	his	623	“ We ’re going away . Soon . For at least a week , although I ’d prefer two . I was thinking we might go back to Crosswinds . Spend the time naked and lazy — ”
81173	81185	81116	81116	His	623	“ You ’re never lazy . Especially when you ’re naked . ”
81186	81193	81194	81194	he	623	“ Especially when you ’re naked , ”
81200	81220	81194	81194	he	623	“ But I ’ve never had you that way for an entire week . You could wear me out . ”
81221	81239	81116	81116	His	623	“ I doubt that ’s possible , fiend . But I ’m willing to try my best . ”
81240	81258	81194	81194	he	623	“ It wo n’t be our honeymoon , per se . I want a month for that . ”
81259	81263	81264	81264	I	46	“ A month ! ”
81276	81295	81264	81264	I	46	“ The entire economy of New York could collapse if you ’re out of the game that long . ”
81311	81326	81296	81296	He	623	“ I think my highly capable team can manage a few weeks without me . ”
81340	81353	81327	81327	I	46	“ I could n’t manage it . I need you too much . ”
81354	81357	81358	81358	He	623	“ Eva . ”
81433	81440	81425	81425	I	46	“ When will you be home ? ”
81441	81448	81425	81425	I	46	“ When you want me there . ”
81449	81468	81469	81469	I	46	“ That would be when your day is done . You ’ve lost enough time over me today . ”
81476	81499	81469	81469	I	46	“ You were n’t just spying on me this afternoon . You knew my lunch with Brett was going to go south . ”
81500	81506	81425	81425	I	46	“ It was a possibility . ”
81507	81516	81469	81469	I	46	“ The spying ? Or the heading south ? ”
81523	81552	81517	81517	He	623	“ You ’re not going to give me a hard time about being there for you . You would ’ve done the same had the situation been reversed . ”
81553	81562	81570	81570	him	623	“ How did you know what he wanted ? ”
81585	81607	81517	81517	He	623	“ I know he ’s getting pressure from Christopher , who ’s also putting pressure on the rest of the band . ”
81608	81616	81517	81517	He	623	“ Why ? To get to you ? ”
81617	81639	81517	81517	He	623	“ In part . You ’re not just some random hot blonde . You ’re Eva Tramell and you ’re news . ”
81640	81660	81661	81661	I	46	“ Maybe I should dye my hair . Get rid of the ‘ Golden . ’ How about red ? ”
81730	81737	81738	81738	I	46	“ Do n’t like the idea ? ”
81754	81796	81738	81738	I	46	“ I like you just the way you are . That said , if you want a change , I wo n’t object . It ’s your body , your right . But do n’t do it just because of them . ”
81797	81804	81815	81815	his	623	“ Would you still want me ? ”
81827	81839	81815	81815	his	623	“ Would you still want me if I had red hair ? ”
81840	81843	81844	81844	I	46	“ Hmm . ”
81858	81869	81844	81844	I	46	“ Maybe we should stick with what we ’ve got . ”
81875	81884	81870	81870	Gideon	339	“ That ’s what I signed up for . ”
81885	81900	81844	81844	I	46	“ You also signed up for letting me have my way with you tonight . ”
81901	81908	81870	81870	Gideon	339	“ Name the time and place . ”
81909	81921	81844	81844	I	46	“ Eight o’clock ? Your apartment on the Upper West Side ? ”
81922	81926	81927	81927	He	46	“ Our apartment . ”
81932	81938	81927	81927	He	46	“ I ’ll be there . ”
81940	81950	81927	81927	He	46	“ BY THE WAY , congratulations on your engagement . ”
81971	81975	81967	81967	Eva	49	“ Thank you . ”
82051	82064	82065	82065	he	46	“ I ’ll keep you posted on the impact of the storm , ”
82075	82107	82065	82065	he	46	“ I appreciate you calling personally to check on us . The weather conditions may set us back a week or two , depending , but we ’ll open on time . ”
82108	82123	82166	82166	Scott	303	“ We have a cushion . Take care of yourself and your crew first . ”
82124	82130	82065	82065	he	46	“ Will do . Thanks . ”
82176	82221	82166	82166	Scott	303	“ Christopher Vidal Sr . is on line one . It ’s his third call today . I ’ve already told him you ’ll get back to him when you can , but he ’s insistent . How do you want me to handle ? ”
82251	82257	82238	82238	I	46	“ I ’ll take it . ”
82264	82274	82258	82258	I	46	“ Chris , what can I do for you ? ”
82275	82305	82238	82238	I	46	“ Gideon . Listen , I ’m sorry to disturb you , but you and I need to talk . Would it be possible for us to meet today ? ”
82325	82331	82314	82314	I	46	“ My office or yours ? ”
82332	82338	82258	82258	I	46	“ No , your penthouse . ”
82345	82356	82339	82339	I	46	“ I wo n’t be home until close to nine . ”
82357	82362	82314	82314	I	46	“ That ’s fine . ”
82363	82369	82339	82339	I	46	“ Is everyone all right ? ”
82370	82383	82314	82314	I	46	“ Yes , everyone ’s fine . Do n’t worry about that . ”
82384	82398	82339	82339	I	46	“ It ’s Vidal , then . We ’ll take care of it . ”
82399	82402	82403	82403	He	203	“ God . ”
82407	82432	82403	82403	He	203	“ You ’re a good man , Gideon . One of the best I know . I should ’ve told you that more often . ”
82443	82457	82433	82433	My	46	“ I ’ve got a few minutes now . Just lay it out . ”
82458	82471	82472	82472	He	203	“ No , not now . I ’ll see you at nine . ”
82663	82669	82643	82643	She	204	“ I’VE got a lead . ”
82689	82738	82680	82680	He	46	“ I ’m still running through the guest list for that event you attended a couple weeks ago . I ’ve also been running twice - daily searches for photos . Got an alert on this one today . I secured a copy and made some zoom views . ”
82785	82801	82777	82777	she	252	“ Emerald green dress , long red hair . This is the woman Eva saw . ”
82835	82844	82829	82829	I	46	“ She was n’t on the guest list ? ”
82845	82888	82777	82777	she	252	“ Not officially , but she was on the red carpet , so I ’m thinking she had to have been someone ’s plus - one . I do n’t know who her escort was yet , but I ’m on it . ”
82899	82915	82891	82891	I	46	“ She went after Eva . You need to keep her away from my wife . ”
82916	82928	82777	82777	she	252	“ Angus and I are developing new protocols for event security . ”
82939	82950	82931	82931	I	46	“ You ’ll tell me if you need more men . ”
82951	82958	82959	82959	He	46	“ I ’ll let you know . ”
82969	82977	82978	82978	he	46	“ She ’s at her office today , ”
82986	82998	82978	82978	he	46	“ Was still there when I headed up to see you . ”
82999	83006	82978	82978	he	46	“ Good . Let ’s go . ”
83007	83011	83012	83017	The petite brunette behind the desk	657	“ EXCUSE me . ”
83027	83043	83012	83017	The petite brunette behind the desk	657	“ You ca n’t go in there . Dr. Lucas is with a patient now . ”
83106	83115	83116	83117	the brunette	657	“ I ’m so sorry , Dr. Lucas , ”
83121	83128	83116	83117	the brunette	657	“ I tried to stop him . ”
83140	83155	83129	83129	Anne	252	“ An impossible task , Michelle . Do n’t worry , you can go . ”
83167	83184	83161	83161	Anne	252	“ We ’ll have to cut today ’s appointment short . I apologize for this incredibly rude interruption”—she
83187	83203	83161	83161	Anne	252	me—“and of course I wo n’t charge you . Please talk to Michelle about rescheduling . ”
83228	83235	83236	83236	Anne	252	“ I could ’ve called security , ”
83252	83268	83236	83236	Anne	252	“ After going to all the trouble of luring me here ? You would n’t . ”
83269	83289	83290	83290	She	252	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . Regardless , it ’s good to see you . ”
83322	83330	83236	83236	Anne	252	“ I ca n’t say the same . ”
83335	83353	83331	83331	Her	252	“ Break your toys , then throw them away . Does Eva know her days are numbered ? ”
83354	83358	83236	83236	Anne	252	“ Do you ? ”
83369	83377	83366	83366	her	252	“ Is that a threat , Gideon ? ”
83378	83387	83388	83388	I	46	“ You ’d like for it to be . ”
83414	83422	83397	83397	She	252	“ Might make your game more interesting . ”
83446	83456	83457	83457	she	252	“ You like to play , too , lover , ”
83460	83515	83457	83457	she	252	“ Tell me , have you tied up your pretty fiancée ? Flogged her into a frenzy ? Shoved one of your extensive array of dildos into her ass , so that it fucked her while you pounded her pussy for hours ? Does she know you , Gideon , the way I do ? ”
83516	83557	83598	83598	her	1255	“ Hundreds of women know me the way you do , Anne . Do you think you were special ? The only thing memorable about you is your husband and how it eats at him that I ’ve had you . ”
83623	83635	83610	83610	I	46	“ Leave Eva alone . I wo n’t tell you twice . ”
83636	83663	83615	83615	she	1255	“ She ’s the chink in your armor , you heartless piece of shit . You ’ve got ice in your veins , but she bleeds . ”
83664	83672	83673	83673	I	46	“ Is that a threat , Anne ? ”
83684	83687	83688	83688	She	1255	“ Absolutely . ”
83695	83711	83688	83688	She	1255	“ It ’s time to pay , and your billions wo n’t cover the debt . ”
83712	83746	83688	83688	She	1255	“ Raising the stakes with a declaration of war ? Are you that stupid ? Or do n’t you care what this will cost you ? Your career … your marriage … everything . ”
83778	83785	83786	83786	she	1255	“ Just watch me , Gideon , ”
83791	83796	83786	83786	she	1255	“ See what happens . ”
83797	83803	83804	83804	I	46	“ Have it your way . ”
83813	83831	83804	83804	I	46	“ You ’ve started this , but make no mistake , the final move will be mine . ”
83832	83845	83846	83847	Dr. Petersen	144	“ HAVE you had any nightmares since we last saw each other ? ”
83865	83868	83804	83804	I	46	“ No . ”
83869	83879	83804	83804	I	46	“ How often would you say you have them ? ”
83909	83923	83894	83894	I	46	“ Lately , once a week . Sometimes a little longer in between . ”
83924	83932	83804	83804	I	46	“ What do you mean by lately ? ”
83933	83939	83894	83894	I	46	“ Since I met Eva . ”
83948	83986	83940	83940	He	144	“ You ’re facing unfamiliar pressures as you work on your relationship with Eva , but the frequency of your nightmares is lessening — at least for now . Do you have any thoughts as to why ? ”
83987	84000	83804	83804	I	46	“ I thought you were supposed to be explaining that to me . ”
84005	84031	84001	84002	Dr. Petersen	144	“ I ca n’t wave a magic wand and give you all the answers , Gideon . I can only help you sort through it . ”
84088	84106	84081	84081	I	46	“ Things are smoothing out for us . We ’re in sync more than we ’re not . ”
84107	84117	84081	84081	I	46	“ Do you feel that you ’re communicating better ? ”
84118	84140	84081	84081	I	46	“ I think we ’re better at gauging the motives behind each other ’s actions . We understand each other more . ”
84141	84186	84081	84081	I	46	“ Your relationship has moved very quickly . You ’re not an impulsive man , but many would say marrying a woman you ’ve known such a short time — and one you admit you ’re still getting to know — is extremely impulsive . ”
84187	84194	84081	84081	I	46	“ Is there a question there ? ”
84195	84199	84200	84200	He	1258	“ An observation . ”
84217	84265	84213	84213	he	1258	“ It can be difficult for spouses of individuals with Eva ’s history . Her commitment to therapy has helped both of you ; however , it ’s likely she ’ll continue to change in ways you may not expect . It will be stressful for you . ”
84266	84273	84274	84274	I	46	“ I ’m no picnic myself , ”
84278	84300	84213	84213	he	1258	“ You ’re a survivor of a different sort . Have you ever felt that your nightmares were aggravated by stress ? ”
84306	84315	84304	84304	me	46	“ What does it matter ? They happen . ”
84316	84333	84213	84213	he	1258	“ You do n’t feel there are changes that can be made to lessen their impact ? ”
84334	84362	84304	84304	me	46	“ I just got married . That ’s a major life change , would n’t you say , Doctor ? I think that ’s enough for now . ”
84363	84429	84213	84213	he	1258	“ Why must there be a limit ? You ’re a young man , Gideon . You have a variety of options available to you . Change does n’t have to be something avoided . What ’s the harm in trying something new ? If it does n’t work out , you always have the option to go back to what you were doing before . ”
84436	84445	84430	84430	I	46	“ Sometimes , you ca n’t go back . ”
84446	84455	84456	84457	Dr. Petersen	144	“ Let ’s try a simple change now , ”
84465	84473	84456	84457	Dr. Petersen	144	“ Let ’s go for a walk . ”
84507	84510	84493	84493	We	1259	“ Why ? ”
84511	84515	84516	84516	He	144	“ Why not ? ”
84522	84587	84516	84516	He	144	“ My office may not be the best place for us to talk . You ’re a man used to being in charge . In here , I am . So we ’ll level the playing field and hit the hallway for a bit . It ’s a public space , but most of the individuals who work in this building have gone home . ”
84610	84620	84621	84621	he	144	“ Ah , well . This is certainly different , ”
84629	84638	84621	84621	he	144	“ Knocks me off my stride a bit . ”
84645	84657	84658	84658	he	144	“ What are your plans for the rest of the evening ? ”
84667	84674	84677	84677	I	46	“ An hour with my trainer . ”
84681	84689	84677	84677	I	46	“ My stepfather is coming over later . ”
84690	84705	84658	84658	he	144	“ To spend time with you and Eva ? Are you close to him ? ”
84706	84712	84713	84713	I	46	“ No , to both . ”
84718	84733	84713	84713	I	46	“ Something ’s wrong . That ’s the only reason he ever calls me . ”
84742	84750	84734	84734	I	46	“ Do you wish that were different ? ”
84751	84754	84713	84713	I	46	“ No . ”
84755	84762	84734	84734	I	46	“ You do n’t like him ? ”
84763	84770	84771	84771	I	46	“ I do n’t dislike him . ”
84787	84798	84782	84782	I	46	“ We just do n’t know each other very well . ”
84799	84805	84734	84734	I	46	“ You could change that . ”
84812	84821	84806	84806	I	46	“ You ’re really pushing that angle tonight . ”
84822	84834	84835	84835	He	144	“ I told you , I do n’t have an angle . ”
84858	84890	84850	84850	he	144	“ When you ’re considering an acquisition or exploring a new avenue of doing business , you bring in people to advise you , right ? Experts in their respective fields ? ”
84899	84914	84891	84891	He	144	“ You could think of me the same way , as an expert consultant . ”
84915	84919	84850	84850	he	144	“ On what ? ”
84920	84924	84925	84925	He	144	“ Your past . ”
84929	84947	84925	84925	He	144	“ I help you with that , you can figure out the rest of your life yourself . ”
84948	84958	84850	84850	he	144	“ GET your head in the game , Cross . ”
85050	85059	85060	85060	I	46	“ Make it worth my while , Cho , ”
85158	85165	85166	85166	he	206	“ You ’re still holding back , ”
85169	85179	85166	85166	he	206	“ Falling in love turn you into a pussy ? ”
85180	85191	85166	85166	he	206	“ You wish . Only way you ’d beat me . ”
85238	85245	85246	85246	he	206	“ You ’re wasting my time , ”
85278	85286	85287	85287	He	206	“ No one piss you off today ? ”
85333	85356	85357	85357	She	1265	“ Yeah . I see that fire in your eyes , Cross . Let it out , man . Bring it on . ”
85381	85387	85388	85388	he	206	“ That all you got ? ”
85407	85411	85412	85412	he	206	“ Fuck yeah , ”
85422	85427	85412	85412	he	206	“ There you are . ”
85477	85482	85483	85483	Raúl	46	“ A couple things , ”
85504	85526	85483	85483	Raúl	46	“ I ’ve noticed that Benjamin Clancy is still keeping an eye on Mrs. Cross . Not constantly , but consistently . ”
85527	85532	85533	85533	I	46	“ Is that so , ”
85537	85551	85483	85483	Raúl	46	“ Are you good with that ? Or should I talk to him ? ”
85552	85559	85560	85560	Clancy	134	“ I ’ll deal with him . ”
85583	85607	85621	85621	He	68	“ Also — and you may know this already — Mrs. Cross had lunch with Ryan Landon and some of his executives today . ”
85632	85652	85621	85621	He	68	“ Thank you , Raúl . I ’ll need a private number for Eva ’s boss , Mark Garrity . ”
85653	85665	85621	85621	He	68	“ I ’ll text it to you when I have it . ”
85756	85759	85742	85742	I	46	“ Cross . ”
85760	85780	85781	85781	Jesus	62	“ Mr. Cross . It ’s Edwin at the front desk . Mr. Vidal is here to see you . ”
85790	85795	85781	85781	Jesus	62	“ Send him up . ”
85796	85804	85781	85781	Jesus	62	“ Yes , sir . Will do . ”
85907	85910	85911	85911	Chris	163	“ Gideon . ”
85938	85943	85911	85911	Chris	163	“ Is Eva here ? ”
85944	85960	85961	85961	He	558	“ She ’s at her place . I ’m heading over there when you leave . ”
85978	85982	85983	85983	I	46	“ Come in , ”
85996	86005	85983	85983	I	46	“ Can I get you something to drink ? ”
86029	86036	86021	86021	He	558	“ Anything strong would be great . ”
86037	86043	86044	86044	I	46	“ Sounds good to me . ”
86196	86204	86182	86182	I	46	“ What ’s going on , Chris ? ”
86217	86229	86205	86205	He	163	“ We ’re going to reshoot the ‘ Golden ’ video . ”
86230	86233	86205	86205	He	163	“ Oh ? ”
86248	86260	86261	86261	he	163	“ I overheard Kline and Christopher arguing in the offices yesterday , ”
86265	86279	86261	86261	he	163	“ and got the story . Kline wants a redo and I agreed . ”
86280	86289	86290	86290	I	46	“ Christopher does n’t , I ’m sure . ”
86325	86333	86261	86261	he	163	“ Your brother will get over it . ”
86361	86382	86349	86349	Chris	163	“ I know the video has caused stress for you and Eva . I should ’ve been paying more attention . ”
86383	86392	86261	86261	he	163	“ I appreciate you being flexible about it . ”
86414	86421	86393	86393	He	47	“ I ’ve left your mother . ”
86444	86454	86422	86422	I	46	“ Ireland told me you two had a fight . ”
86455	86467	86468	86468	He	47	“ Yeah . I hate that Ireland had to hear it . ”

94460	94487	94423	94423	Gideon	339	“ No , it ’s fine . I ’m sorry I did n’t call you back sooner . I did n’t mean to make you worry . ”
94488	94495	94423	94423	Gideon	339	“ Is he okay , then ? ”
94507	94516	94496	94496	I	46	“ No . It was a rough night . ”
94517	94532	94423	94423	Gideon	339	“ I called his office . They told me he was out this morning . ”
94533	94543	94496	94496	I	46	“ We ’re home . He ’s still sleeping . ”
94544	94551	94552	94552	he	46	“ It ’s bad , then , ”
94589	94596	94597	94597	I	46	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
94601	94615	94597	94597	I	46	“ I ’ll make sure of it . He just needs some time . ”
94616	94624	94560	94560	Gideon	339	“ Is there anything I can do ? ”
94625	94638	94597	94597	I	46	“ If I think of anything , I ’ll let you know . ”
94639	94643	94644	94644	He	46	“ Thank you . ”
94650	94687	94644	94644	He	46	“ Thank you for saying something to me and being there for him . I wish I had been when it was happening . I ’ll have to live with the fact that I was n’t . ”
94688	94735	94597	94597	I	46	“ We all have to live with it . It ’s not your fault , Chris . Does n’t make it easier , I know , but you need to keep it in mind or you ’ll beat yourself up . That wo n’t help Gideon . ”
94736	94754	94644	94644	He	46	“ You ’re wise beyond your years , Eva . I ’m so glad he has you . ”
94755	94762	94763	94763	I	46	“ I got lucky with him , ”
94767	94772	94763	94763	I	46	“ Big - time . ”
94863	94903	94856	94856	she	319	“ Eva . You ’ve been deliberately avoiding me . How am I supposed to plan your wedding without your input ? There are so many decisions to make and if I make the wrong one , you ’ll — ”
94904	94909	94910	94910	I	46	“ Hi , Mom , ”
94913	94918	94910	94910	I	46	“ How are you ? ”
94919	94922	94923	94923	she	319	“ Stressed , ”
94937	94962	94923	94923	she	319	“ How could I be anything else ? I ’m planning one of the most important days of your life all by myself and — ”
94963	94986	94923	94923	she	319	“ I was thinking we could get together on Saturday and hash it all out , if that fits into your schedule . ”
94987	94990	94923	94923	she	319	“ Really ? ”
95002	95007	95008	95008	I	46	“ Yes , really . ”
95094	95121	95090	95092	Mrs. Gideon Cross	339	“ That would be wonderful , Eva ! We could have brunch here with the wedding planner . Spend the afternoon going over all our options . ”
95122	95132	95134	95134	she	339	“ I want something small , Mom . Intimate . ”
95145	95167	95137	95137	I	46	“ We can go as crazy as you want with the reception , but I want our wedding to be private . ”
95168	95187	95090	95092	Mrs. Gideon Cross	339	“ Eva , people will be insulted if they ’re invited to the reception and not the ceremony ! ”
95188	95243	95137	95137	I	46	“ I really do n’t care . I ’m not getting married for them . I ’m getting married because I ’m in love with the man of my dreams and we ’re going to spend the rest of our lives together . I do n’t want the focus to ever shift from that . ”
95244	95247	95248	95248	She	339	“ Honey … ”
95257	95267	95248	95248	She	339	“ We can talk more about this on Saturday . ”
95268	95279	95280	95280	I	46	“ Okay . But I ’m not changing my mind . ”
95329	95336	95337	95337	I	46	“ I ’ve got to go , ”
95342	95353	95337	95337	I	46	“ I ’ll see you this weekend . Love you . ”
95354	95374	95337	95337	I	46	“ I love you , too , Eva . That ’s why I only want the best for you . ”
95397	95401	95393	95393	I	46	“ Good morning . ”
95402	95409	95410	95410	he	1367	“ You ’re not at work , ”
95422	95427	95393	95393	I	46	“ Neither are you . ”
95428	95435	95393	95393	I	46	“ Are you going in late ? ”
95436	95446	95447	95447	I	46	“ Nope . And you ’re not , either . ”
95475	95498	95467	95467	My	46	“ We ’re going to hole up today , ace . Just you and me hanging out in our pajamas and relaxing . ”
95519	95525	95506	95506	his	1367	“ You ’re not mad . ”
95526	95532	95499	95499	His	1367	“ Why would I be ? ”
95543	95550	95499	95499	His	1367	“ Are you mad at me ? ”
95551	95554	95555	95555	He	1367	“ No . ”
95566	95574	95555	95555	He	1367	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
95575	95588	95499	95499	His	1367	“ I ’ll always be here . Until death do us part . ”
95589	95596	95555	95555	He	1367	“ You ’re planning the wedding . ”
95597	95619	95499	95499	His	1367	“ You heard that , huh ? If you ’ve got requests , tell me now or forever hold your peace . ”
95658	95670	95645	95645	I	46	“ Did you see what I left you by the bed ? ”
95671	95677	95687	95687	He	1367	“ Yes , thank you . ”
95705	95739	95687	95687	He	1367	“ I got you off the hook at work , too , but Arash said he had some papers to send over to us . He would n’t tell me what they were . ”
95740	95751	95687	95687	He	1367	“ Guess you ’ll have to wait and find out . ”
95760	95766	95752	95752	I	46	“ How are you doing ? ”
95774	95789	95767	95767	His	1367	“ I do n’t know . Right now , I just feel like shit . ”
95790	95801	95767	95767	His	1367	“ Let ’s revisit that bath you missed last night . ”
95802	95811	95767	95767	His	1367	“ Umm , I ’m feeling better already . ”
95826	95839	95840	95840	he	1367	“ I want to be the man of your dreams , angel , ”
95846	95854	95840	95840	he	1367	“ I want that more than anything . ”
95861	95871	95855	95855	I	46	“ You ’ve got that in the bag already . ”
95926	95935	95936	95936	I	46	“ You ’re buying the Outer Banks house ? ”
95956	95968	95951	95951	His	1367	“ We ’re buying the house . We agreed we would . ”
95969	95975	95951	95951	His	1367	“ We talked about it . ”
96037	96047	96029	96029	Gideon	339	“ Now , we ’re doing something about it . ”
96048	96058	96029	96029	Gideon	339	“ The Hamptons would be closer . Or Connecticut . ”
96059	96069	96070	96070	He	1367	“ It ’s a quick hop down by jet . ”
96085	96093	96094	96094	he	1367	“ Do n’t worry about the logistics , ”
96097	96148	96094	96094	he	1367	“ We were happy there on the beach . I can still picture you walking along the shore . I remember kissing you on the deck … spreading you across that big white bed . You looked like an angel and that place , for me , was like heaven . ”
96149	96152	96153	96153	I	46	“ Gideon . ”
96166	96172	96153	96153	I	46	“ Where do we sign ? ”
96201	96207	96190	96190	His	1367	“ Where ’s my pen ? ”
96211	96220	96208	96208	I	46	“ I ’ve got one in my purse . ”
96234	96250	96228	96228	he	1367	“ No . I need my pen . Where ’s the envelope this came in ? ”
96319	96324	96325	96325	he	1367	“ There we go , ”
96454	96457	96458	96458	I	46	“ Wow , ”
96483	96488	96458	96458	I	46	“ I love this . ”
96489	96492	96493	96493	He	69	“ Here . ”
96532	96538	96458	96458	I	46	“ You superstitious or something ? ”
96539	96546	96509	96509	I	46	“ It was my father ’s . ”
96547	96550	96551	96551	I	46	“ Oh . ”
96556	96574	96575	96575	He	69	“ He signed everything with it . He never went anywhere without it tucked in his pocket . ”
96584	96593	96575	96575	He	69	“ He destroyed our name with that pen . ”
96602	96619	96594	96594	I	46	“ And you ’re building it back up with the same pen . I get it . ”
96632	96638	96620	96620	His	69	“ I knew you would . ”
96640	96652	96653	96654	Blaire Ash	220	“ HIS - AND - HERS MASTER SUITE — a classic . ”
96708	96718	96719	96720	the designer	1385	“ How big a change are you looking for ? ”
96723	96751	96719	96720	the designer	1385	“ Do you want to start with a blank slate , or are you just looking for the easiest structural change that will combine the two rooms ? ”
96819	96828	96811	96811	She	252	“ What would the easy way look like ? ”
96912	96942	96909	96910	my wife	252	“ We could simply adjust the layout of the master bath and knock out an arched entry through this wall , effectively joining the two rooms via the bathroom . ”
96943	96951	96952	96952	Eva	49	“ That ’s just what we need , ”
96955	96978	96993	96993	He	220	“ Right . It ’s quick and efficient , and the actual construction would n’t be all that disruptive to your lives . Or”—he
96980	96987	96993	96993	He	220	on—“I could show you some alternatives . ”
96988	96992	96993	96993	He	220	“ Like what ? ”
97029	97045	97046	97046	he	220	“ If we work with the square footage of all three bedrooms and master bathroom , ”
97060	97101	97046	97046	he	220	“ I could give you a master suite that ’s balanced on both sides . Both bedrooms would be the same size , with his - and - hers adjoining home offices — or sitting room , if you prefer . ”
97102	97105	97106	97106	She	49	“ Oh . ”
97117	97129	97106	97106	She	49	“ I ca n’t believe you sketched that up so quickly . ”
97135	97163	97130	97130	He	220	“ Fast and thorough is my motto . And getting the job done so well that you think of me when you want to do it again . ”
97208	97215	97203	97203	She	49	“ I bet Cary ’s here . ”
97216	97226	97227	97227	I	46	“ Why do n’t you get that , angel ? ”
97230	97243	97227	97227	I	46	“ Maybe you should bring him up yourself , share your excitement . ”
97244	97247	97248	97248	She	49	“ Yes ! ”
97277	97285	97270	97270	I	46	“ You ’re flirting with my wife . ”
97296	97318	97286	97286	He	220	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean anything by it . I just want Miss Tramell to feel comfortable . ”
97319	97331	97332	97332	I	46	“ I ’ll worry about her . You worry about me . ”
97402	97409	97394	97394	His	1397	“ Of course , Mr. Cross . ”
97410	97423	97394	97394	His	1397	“ Now , let ’s see what you ’ve sketched so far . ”
97424	97430	97431	97431	Eva	49	“ WHAT do you think ? ”
97476	97492	97493	97493	she	49	“ I mean the idea of a master suite with two mirroring sides is lovely , ”
97506	97542	97493	97493	she	49	“ but if we go the easy route , it ’ll be faster . Plus we could close up the wall again one day , if we want to use the room for something else . ”
97543	97548	97549	97549	Cary	483	“ Like a nursery , ”
97591	97597	97598	97598	Eva	49	“ Or a guest room , ”
97601	97614	97598	97598	Eva	49	“ I liked what you talked to Blaire about for your apartment . ”
97621	97625	97615	97615	Cary	483	“ Quick dodge . ”
97626	97652	97598	97598	Eva	49	“ Hey , you may have babies on your mind , but the rest of us have other things to check off our lists first . ”
97716	97726	97727	97727	I	46	“ I have some calls to make . Stay , ”
97732	97738	97727	97727	I	46	“ Spend time with Eva . ”
97745	97748	97739	97739	He	483	“ Thanks . ”
97759	97762	97763	97763	Cary	483	“ So , ”
97773	97790	97763	97763	Cary	483	“ hot - designer - dude ’s got a thing for your man , baby girl . ”
97791	97796	97797	97797	Eva	49	“ He does not ! ”
97800	97805	97797	97797	Eva	49	“ You ’re crazy . ”
97806	97829	97763	97763	Cary	483	“ No argument there , but that Ash guy barely glanced at you all night and kept his eyes glued on Cross . ”
97857	97865	97866	97866	she	49	“ Well , if you ’re right , ”
97869	97877	97866	97866	she	49	“ I have to admire his taste . ”
98053	98062	98063	98064	my wife	252	“ You could talk to me , Cary ! ”
98068	98078	98063	98064	my wife	252	“ You could tell me what ’s going on . ”
98079	98089	98090	98090	he	483	“ You know what the fuck is going on , ”
98105	98115	98063	98064	my wife	252	“ I did n’t know you were cutting again ! ”
98146	98154	98155	98155	he	483	“ It ’s none of your business , ”
98171	98177	98166	98166	He	483	“ Not yours , either . ”
98178	98184	98185	98185	I	46	“ I do n’t disagree , ”
98211	98220	98221	98221	Eva	49	“ Bullshit . That ’s total fucking bullshit . ”
98244	98254	98238	98238	she	49	“ I thought you were talking to Dr. Travis . ”
98255	98264	98265	98265	he	483	“ When do I have time for that ? ”
98276	98298	98265	98265	he	483	“ Between my work and Tat ’s , plus trying to keep Trey , I do n’t have time to sleep ! ”
98304	98312	98299	98299	Eva	49	“ That ’s a cop - out . ”
98313	98322	98323	98323	he	483	“ Do n’t lecture me , baby girl , ”
98326	98336	98323	98323	he	483	“ I do n’t need your shit right now . ”
98337	98342	98343	98343	She	49	“ Oh my God . ”
98354	98375	98343	98343	She	49	“ Why the fuck do the men in my life insist on shutting me out when they need me most ? ”
98376	98401	98323	98323	he	483	“ Ca n’t speak for Cross , but you ’re not around for me anymore . I ’m getting by the best I can . ”
98407	98431	98402	98402	Her	49	“ That ’s not fair ! You have to tell me when you need me . I ’m not a damn mind reader ! ”
98662	98670	98671	98671	she	252	“ What are you doing , ace ? ”
98697	98701	98683	98683	I	46	“ Admiring you . ”
98706	98713	98702	98702	Her	252	“ How are you feeling today ? ”
98714	98717	98702	98702	Her	252	“ Better . ”
98718	98723	98726	98726	she	252	“ Better is good . ”
98749	98763	98742	98742	Her	252	“ You ’re ready to tackle the world today , are n’t you ? ”
98764	98774	98733	98733	She	252	“ I ’d much rather stay home with you . ”
98779	98796	98775	98775	Her	252	“ You ’re just saying that . You ’re itching to get back to global domination . ”
98808	98815	98800	98800	I	46	“ You know me so well . ”
98865	98882	98861	98861	I	46	“ I could work the morning at home , and then spend the afternoon with you . ”
98888	98912	98883	98883	She	252	“ If you want to talk , I ’ll stay home . Otherwise , I ’ve got a job to get back to . ”
98913	98926	98883	98883	She	252	“ If you worked with me , you could cybercommute , too . ”
98927	98946	98883	98883	She	252	“ You ’d rather push me on that , huh ? That ’s the tack you wanna take ? ”
99004	99011	99012	99012	I	46	“ There ’s nothing to say , ”
99015	99034	99012	99012	I	46	“ It happened . Now Chris knows . Talking about it after the fact wo n’t change anything . ”
99042	99062	99035	99035	I	46	“ It ’s not talking about the events themselves that matters , it ’s how you feel about them . ”
99063	99088	99037	99037	her	252	“ I do n’t feel anything . It … surprised me . I do n’t like surprises . Now , I ’m over it . ”
99089	99092	99093	99093	She	252	“ Bullshit . ”
99105	99119	99093	99093	She	252	“ If you ’re just going to lie , keep your mouth shut . ”
99253	99263	99241	99241	she	49	“ I ca n’t fight with you right now , ”
99280	99297	99241	99241	she	49	“ If we ’re out of sync , I wo n’t make it through the day . ”
99298	99317	99241	99241	she	49	“ Then do n’t tell me you ’re over it when you ’re struggling to keep it together ! ”
99323	99344	99318	99318	I	46	“ I do n’t know what to do with this . I do n’t see how Chris knowing changes anything . ”
99350	99364	99345	99345	Her	49	“ He ’s worried about you . Are you going to call him ? ”
99383	99400	99371	99371	I	46	“ I ’ll talk to him at some point . We do manage a business together . ”
99401	99412	99345	99345	Her	49	“ You ’d rather avoid him . Tell me why . ”
99419	99451	99413	99413	I	46	“ We ’re not suddenly going to be the best of friends , Eva . We rarely saw each other before , and I see no reason for that to change . ”
99452	99459	99371	99371	I	46	“ Are you angry with him ? ”
99460	99476	99477	99477	I	46	“ Jesus . Why the fuck is it my job to make him feel better ? ”
99486	99520	99483	99483	She	1246	“ Nothing is going to make him feel better , and I do n’t think he expects that of you . He just wants to know that you ’re back on your stride . ”
99538	99567	99532	99532	Her	1246	“ Gideon … you ca n’t just shove your feelings into a box . Not unless you want an explosion like the other night . Or another nightmare . ”
99583	99593	99573	99573	my	46	“ We managed the last two nights just fine ! ”
99632	99641	99642	99642	she	49	“ You did n’t sleep on Tuesday night , ”
99645	99662	99642	99642	she	49	“ And last night you were so exhausted , I doubt you even dreamed at all . ”
99690	99699	99680	99680	I	46	“ What do you want me to say ? ”
99700	99725	99663	99663	She	49	“ This is n’t about me ! It helps to talk things over , Gideon . Laying it all out helps us gain perspective . ”
99726	99773	99680	99680	I	46	“ Perspective ? I ’ve got that just fine . There was no mistaking the pity on Chris ’s face last night . Or yours ! I do n’t need anyone feeling sorry for me , damn it . I do n’t need their fucking guilt . ”
99779	99857	99774	99774	Her	49	“ I ca n’t speak for Chris , but that was n’t pity you saw on me , Gideon . Sympathy , maybe , because I know what you ’re feeling . And pain , certainly , because my heart is connected to yours . When you ’re hurting , I ’m hurting , too . You ’ll have to learn to deal with that , because I love you and I ’m not going to stop . ”
99966	99975	99976	99976	she	49	“ He does n’t see you as weak , ”
99994	100025	99987	99987	Her	49	“ No one could . After what you ’ve been through … to be the man you are today . That ’s strength , baby . And I ’m impressed . ”
100034	100039	100040	100040	I	46	“ You ’re biased , ”
100043	100051	100040	100040	I	46	“ You ’re in love with me . ”
100052	100071	99987	99987	Her	49	“ Of course I am . How could I be anything else ? You ’re amazing and perfect — ”
100075	100080	100081	100081	she	49	“ Perfect for me , ”
100084	100098	100081	100081	she	49	“ And since you belong to me , that ’s a good thing . ”
100118	100126	100127	100127	I	46	“ I feel like this changed things , ”
100130	100138	100127	100127	I	46	“ but I do n’t know how . ”
100139	100146	100147	100147	Her	49	“ We figure it out together . ”
100158	100179	100147	100147	Her	49	“ Just do n’t push me away . You have to stop trying to protect me , especially from yourself ! ”
100180	100195	100127	100127	I	46	“ I ca n’t hurt you , angel . Ca n’t take any risks . ”
100196	100214	100147	100147	Her	49	“ Whatever . I can take you down , ace , if you get out of hand . ”
100247	100257	100127	100127	I	46	“ I ’ve been thinking about the penthouse renovations . ”
100258	100265	100127	100127	I	46	“ You ’re changing the subject . ”
100266	100277	100278	100278	I	46	“ We exhausted the subject . It ’s not closed , ”
100281	100292	100278	100278	I	46	“ just tabled until there are additional variables to address . ”
100297	100315	100293	100293	She	49	“ Why does it turn me on when you go all alpha mogul on me like that ? ”
100316	100332	100127	100127	I	46	“ Do n’t tell me there are times when I do n’t turn you on . ”
100333	100348	100293	100293	She	49	“ God , I wish . I ’d be a more productive human being . ”
100359	100368	100349	100349	I	46	“ Have you thought about what you want ? ”
100369	100378	100127	100127	I	46	“ Whatever ends with your cock inside me . ”
100379	100391	100349	100349	I	46	“ Good to know . I was talking about the penthouse . ”
100402	100408	100392	100392	She	49	“ Same goes either way . ”
100618	100629	100608	100609	Benjamin Clancy	134	“ What can I do for you , Mr. Cross ? ”
100630	100638	100608	100609	Benjamin Clancy	134	“ I believe I owe you thanks . ”
100678	100698	100665	100665	His	483	“ Do you ? Well , then , I accept . Although I did n’t do it for you . ”
100699	100707	100708	100708	I	46	“ I did n’t think you did . ”
100712	100719	100708	100708	I	46	“ You ’re still keeping watch . ”
100723	100743	100720	100720	Clancy	134	“ She ’s been through enough . I ’m going to see she does n’t go through any more . ”
100744	100754	100665	100665	His	483	“ You do n’t trust me to do that ? ”
100755	100786	100720	100720	Clancy	134	“ I do n’t know you enough to trust you . In my opinion , neither does she . So I ’ll keep an eye on things for a while . ”
100787	100806	100665	100665	His	483	“ I love her . I think I ’ve proven how far I ’ll go to protect her . ”
100811	100855	100807	100807	His	134	“ Some men need to be put down like rabid dogs . Some men need to be the ones to do it . I did n’t peg you as one of those guys either way . That makes you rogue in my book . ”
100856	100865	100720	100720	Clancy	134	“ I take care of what ’s mine . ”
100866	100877	100878	100878	His	134	“ Oh , you took care of it all right . ”
100887	100962	100878	100878	His	134	“ And I took care of the rest . As long as Eva is happy with you , we ’ll leave it at that . You decide someday she ’s not what you want , you cut her off clean and with respect . If you hurt her in any way at all , then you ’ve got a problem , whether I ’m still breathing or in the grave . You got me ? ”
100963	100982	100983	100983	Eva	49	“ You do n’t have to threaten me to be good to her , but I heard you . ”
101042	101067	101038	101038	I	46	“ Eva does n’t like being spied on . If you become a problem for her , we ’ll sit down like this again . ”
101068	101077	101140	101140	Clancy	134	“ You planning on making it a problem ? ”
101078	101139	101038	101038	I	46	“ No . If she catches you at it , it wo n’t be because I tipped her off . Just keep in mind that she ’s spent her life looking over her shoulder and being suffocated by her mother . She ’s breathing easy for the first time . I wo n’t let you take that away from her . ”
101145	101153	101140	101140	Clancy	134	“ I guess we understand each other . ”
101167	101174	101154	101154	I	46	“ I ’d say we do . ”
101264	101287	101260	101260	Scott	303	“ I ’ve confirmed your agenda for tomorrow . Mrs. Vidal will meet you and Miss Tramell at The Modern at noon . ”
101304	101315	101299	101299	I	46	“ Thank you , Scott . Have a good night . ”
101316	101328	101260	101260	Scott	303	“ You , too , Mr. Cross . See you tomorrow . ”
101472	101476	101443	101443	she	49	“ Mr. Cross . ”
101497	101503	101488	101488	him	303	“ You ’re still here . ”
101507	101552	101504	101504	He	303	“ I was on my way out to the elevators when Cheryl caught me at reception . There ’s a Deanna Johnson in the lobby asking for you . I wanted to confirm that I should tell her you ’re no longer available today . ”
101574	101581	101561	101561	I	46	“ They can send her up . ”
101582	101590	101612	101612	She	1442	“ Do you need me to stay ? ”
101591	101601	101561	101561	I	46	“ No , you can go . Thank you . ”
101667	101679	101655	101655	She	1442	“ Gideon . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . ”
101688	101707	101680	101680	I	46	“ I expect you would n’t go to the trouble of coming here directly unless it was important . ”
101744	101751	101752	101752	she	1442	“ Worth it for the view , ”
101772	101793	101752	101752	she	1442	“ I ’m sorry , but I ’ve got an appointment , so we ’ll have to make this quick . ”
101794	101803	101805	101805	her	1442	“ I ’m in a hurry , too . ”
101864	101872	101873	101873	I	46	“ We ’ll be ready in ten , ”
101880	101888	101873	101873	I	46	“ I ’ll bring the car around . ”
101907	101912	101913	101913	she	1442	“ How ’s Eva ? ”
101916	101932	101896	101896	Deanna	223	“ She ’ll be here in a few moments . You can ask her yourself . ”
101933	101936	101937	101937	She	1442	“ Oh . ”
101953	101973	101937	101937	She	1442	“ I should probably be gone before she gets here . I think our … history makes her uncomfortable . ”
101974	101981	101982	101982	I	46	“ She knows how I was , ”
101986	101997	101982	101982	I	46	“ and she knows I ’m not that way now . ”
102001	102029	101998	101998	Deanna	223	“ Of course she does , and of course you ’re not , but no woman likes when her man ’s past gets rubbed in her face . ”
102030	102044	101998	101998	Deanna	223	“ Then you ’ll have to make sure you do n’t do that . ”
102064	102077	102048	102048	She	223	“ I would n’t . I accepted your apology and appreciate it . ”
102078	102081	102048	102048	She	223	“ Good . ”
102082	102094	102048	102048	She	223	“ It ’s Corinne Giroux you might want to worry about . ”
102102	102113	102097	102097	I	46	“ Corinne is her husband ’s concern , not mine . ”
102148	102161	102162	102162	she	223	“ She ’s sold a tell - all book about your relationship , ”
102166	102178	102162	102162	she	223	“ The release officially hits the wire Monday morning at nine . ”
102180	102214	102215	102215	I	46	“ OTHER COUPLES MEET , hit things off , their friends nitpick a little but are mostly supportive , and they coast for a while in that couple stage just enjoying each other . ”
102230	102246	102215	102215	I	46	“ We , on the other hand , ca n’t seem to catch a break . ”
102247	102257	102258	102259	Dr. Petersen	144	“ What kind of breaks are you referring to ? ”
102311	102345	102294	102295	Dr. Petersen	144	“ The only people who really want us to be together are my mother — who thinks us loving each other is a bonus to his billions — and his stepfather and sister . ”
102346	102360	102361	102362	Dr. Petersen	144	“ I do n’t think that ’s a fair assessment of your mother , ”
102372	102380	102361	102362	Dr. Petersen	144	“ She wants you to be happy . ”
102381	102430	102431	102431	I	46	“ Yeah , well , a lot of being happy for my mom is being financially secure , which I just do n’t understand . It ’s not like she ’s ever struggled for money , so why is she so afraid of not having any ? Anywayyyy … ”
102434	102484	102431	102431	I	46	“ I ’m just irritated with everyone right now . Gideon and I get along great when it ’s just the two of us . I mean we fight sometimes , but we always get through it . And I feel like we ’re always stronger once we do . ”
102485	102492	102532	102532	he	46	“ What do you fight about ? ”
102642	102666	102635	102635	I	46	“ We still argue about the things he does n’t tell me . And we argue when he tries to shut me out . ”
102674	102688	102667	102667	He	144	“ Do you feel the need to maintain a certain distance from Eva ? ”
102696	102743	102689	102690	My husband	623	“ There is no distance between us , Doctor . She wants me to dump everything on her that ’s an irritant to me and I wo n’t do that . Ever . It ’s bad enough if one of us has to bother with it . ”
102751	102813	102744	102744	I	46	“ I think that ’s crap . Part of a relationship is sharing the load with someone else . Maybe sometimes I ca n’t do anything about the problem , but I can be a sounding board . I think you do n’t tell me things just because you ’d rather shove them into a corner where you can ignore them . ”
102814	102824	102825	102825	I	46	“ People process information in different ways , Eva . ”
102834	102862	102829	102829	Gideon	339	“ You ’re not processing , you ’re ignoring . And I ’m never going to be okay with you pushing me away when you ’re hurting . ”
102863	102871	102872	102873	Dr. Petersen	144	“ How does he push you away ? ”
102881	102905	102876	102876	I	46	“ Gideon … separates himself . He goes somewhere else where he can be alone . He wo n’t let me help him . ”
102906	102924	102829	102829	Gideon	339	“ ‘ Goes somewhere else ’ how ? Do you emotionally withdraw , Gideon ? Or physically ? ”
102925	102928	102929	102929	I	46	“ Both , ”
102932	102942	102929	102929	I	46	“ He shuts down emotionally and goes away physically . ”
102953	102967	102943	102943	Gideon	339	“ I ca n’t shut down with you . That ’s the problem . ”
102968	102975	102992	102993	Dr. Petersen	144	“ That ’s not a problem ! ”
102981	102988	102989	102989	I	46	“ He does n’t need space , ”
102995	103018	102989	102989	I	46	“ he needs me , but he cuts me off because he ’s afraid he ’ll hurt me if he does n’t . ”
103019	103028	102943	102943	Gideon	339	“ How would you hurt her , Gideon ? ”
103029	103033	103034	103034	He	144	“ It ’s … ”
103038	103076	103034	103034	He	144	“ Eva has triggers . I keep them in mind , all the time . I ’m careful . But sometimes , when I ’m not thinking clearly , it ’s possible I could cross the line . ”
103082	103091	103077	103078	Dr. Petersen	144	“ What lines are you worried about crossing ? ”
103110	103139	103092	103092	Gideon	339	“ There are times when I need her too much . I can be rough … demanding . Sometimes , I do n’t have the control I need . ”
103140	103149	103150	103150	He	144	“ You ’re talking about your sexual relationship ? ”
103156	103184	103150	103150	He	144	“ We ’ve touched on that briefly before . You said you have sex multiple times a day , every day . Is that still the case ? ”
103202	103205	103191	103191	Gideon	339	“ Yes . ”
103213	103323	103206	103207	Dr. Petersen	144	“ You ’re right to be concerned . Gideon , you may be using sex to keep Eva at an emotional distance . When you ’re making love , she ’s not talking , you ’re not answering . There ’s a point when you ’re not even thinking , your body is in charge and your brain is just along for the endorphin ride . Conversely , sexual abuse survivors like Eva often use sex as a way to establish an emotional connection . Can you see the problem there ? You may be trying to achieve distance through sex , while Eva is trying to get closer . ”
103324	103335	103336	103336	Gideon	339	“ I ’ve already told you there ’s no distance . ”
103347	103352	103336	103336	Gideon	339	“ Not with Eva . ”
103353	103378	103336	103336	Gideon	339	“ So tell me , when you ’re struggling emotionally and you initiate sex with Eva , what is it you ’re looking for ? ”
103451	103455	103456	103456	he	144	“ The connection , ”
103459	103484	103456	103456	he	144	“ There ’s this moment . She opens and I … I open , and we ’re there . Together . I need that . ”
103485	103491	103423	103423	His	144	“ You need it rough ? ”
103497	103553	103492	103492	Gideon	339	“ Sometimes . There are times when she holds back . But I can get her there . She wants me to get her there , needs it like I do . I have to push . Carefully . With control . When I do n’t have the control , I need to back off . ”
103554	103560	103561	103562	Dr. Petersen	144	“ How do you push ? ”
103566	103572	103492	103492	Gideon	339	“ I have my ways . ”
103581	103589	103573	103574	Dr. Petersen	144	“ Has Gideon ever gone too far ? ”
103595	103604	103590	103590	I	46	“ Do you ever worry that he might ? ”
103605	103608	103573	103574	Dr. Petersen	144	“ No . ”
103619	103629	103609	103609	His	144	“ You should , Eva . You both should . ”
103670	103674	103675	103675	he	483	“ Smells good , ”
103732	103738	103739	103739	he	483	“ Got enough for me ? ”
103742	103746	103794	103794	he	483	“ Just you ? ”
103762	103765	103754	103754	I	46	“ Yep . ”
103766	103779	103747	103747	He	483	“ Then I ’ve got enough , if you pour the wine . ”
103780	103787	103754	103754	I	46	“ You got yourself a deal . ”
103804	103809	103794	103794	he	483	“ White or red ? ”
103810	103815	103747	103747	He	483	“ It ’s chicken . ”
103816	103827	103794	103794	he	483	“ White it is , then . Where ’s Cross ? ”
103837	103850	103828	103828	I	46	“ With his trainer , working out . How was your day ? ”
103854	103860	103851	103851	He	483	“ Same shit as always . ”
103861	103864	103865	103865	I	46	“ Cary . ”
103874	103902	103865	103865	I	46	“ Just a few weeks ago , you were so happy to be here in New York and getting jobs . Now … you ’re so unhappy . ”
103912	103922	103908	103908	he	483	“ That ’s what I get for fucking around . ”
103923	103935	103953	103953	I	46	“ I ’m sorry I have n’t been here for you . ”
103948	103952	103936	103936	He	483	“ But … ? ”
103958	104014	103953	103953	I	46	“ No buts . I ’m sorry . I will say that you ’ve had company most nights I ’m home , so I figured that ’s why we were n’t talking as much , but that does n’t excuse me from not reaching out when I know you ’re going through a difficult time . ”
104022	104053	104015	104015	Cary	483	“ It was n’t fair to dump everything on you last night . I know Cross has got his own shit to wade through and you ’re dealing with that . ”
104054	104066	104067	104067	I	46	“ That does n’t mean I ’m not here for you . ”
104075	104091	104067	104067	I	46	“ Anytime you need me , just let me know and I ’ll be there . ”
104182	104185	104186	104186	he	483	“ God , ”
104189	104201	104186	104186	he	483	“ I ’ve fucked this all up to hell and back . ”
104202	104208	104209	104209	He	483	“ What ’s going on ? ”
104224	104285	104209	104209	He	483	“ I do n’t know if it ’s hormones or what , but Tat is a raging fucking bitch right now . Nothing is good enough . Nothing makes her happy , especially being pregnant . What shot has the poor kid got with me as a father and a self - centered diva who hates him as his mother ? ”
104286	104293	104294	104294	I	46	“ Maybe it ’s a girl , ”
104309	104325	104326	104326	He	483	“ Jesus . Do n’t say that . I ’m panicked enough as it is . ”
104345	104378	104326	104326	He	483	“ And I feel like an asshole talking about the mother of my baby that way , but it ’s the truth . God help us , it ’s the damned truth . ”
104379	104406	104407	104407	I	46	“ I ’m sure it ’s just the hormones . It ’ll all settle in , and then she ’ll get that glow and be happy . ”
104423	104430	104407	104407	I	46	“ Have you told Trey yet ? ”
104436	104461	104431	104431	Cary	483	“ He ’s the one sane thing I ’ve got going on right now . I lose him , I ’ll lose my mind . ”
104462	104471	104326	104326	He	483	“ He ’s stayed with you so far . ”
104472	104501	104431	104431	Cary	483	“ And I have to work for it , Eva . Every day . I ’ve never worked so hard . And I ’m not talking about fucking . ”
104502	104510	104511	104511	I	46	“ I did n’t think you were . ”
104525	104555	104511	104511	I	46	“ What I think is that you ’re an amazing guy and anyone would be lucky to have you . I ’m pretty sure Trey feels the same way . ”
104556	104562	104563	104563	His	46	“ Do n’t . Please . ”
104568	104588	104563	104563	His	46	“ I ’m trying to be real here . I do n’t need you to blow smoke at me . ”
104589	104607	104608	104608	I	46	“ I ’m not . Maybe what I said was n’t deep , but it ’s true . ”
104617	104654	104608	104608	I	46	“ Gideon does n’t tell me what ’s going on with him a lot of the time . He says he ’s trying to protect me , but what he ’s really doing is protecting himself . ”
104671	104739	104740	104740	I	46	“ He ’s afraid that the more he tells me , the more reason he gives me to walk away . But it ’s just the opposite , Cary . The more he does n’t say , the more I do n’t feel like he trusts me , and that ’s hurting us . You and Trey have been together as long as Gideon and I have . ”
104748	104776	104740	104740	I	46	“ You have to tell him . If he finds out about the baby some other way — and he will — he might not forgive you . ”
104792	104815	104777	104777	Cary	483	“ I feel like if I just had more time to get a handle on things , I could deal with Trey . ”
104816	104822	104823	104823	I	46	“ Waiting is n’t helping , ”
104833	104838	104823	104823	I	46	“ You ’re backsliding . ”
104839	104846	104847	104847	His	483	“ What else have I got ? ”
104854	104871	104847	104847	His	483	“ I do n’t fuck around anymore . A monk gets off more than I do . ”
104958	104964	104965	104965	I	46	“ You ’ve got me , ”
104968	104988	105090	105090	He	46	“ Baby girl , I love you , but you ’re not always what I need to get by . ”
104989	105018	105090	105090	He	46	“ Cutting yourself and banging everyone who ’ll let you is n’t getting you by , either . They certainly do n’t help you feel good about yourself . ”
105019	105024	105090	105090	He	46	“ Something has to . ”
105041	105089	105025	105025	I	46	“ Taking care of yourself will do it . Trusting the people you love will help , too . Being honest with yourself and with them . Sounds simple , but we both know it ’s not . Still , it ’s the only way , Cary . ”
105106	105111	105090	105090	He	46	“ I ’m scared . ”
105112	105115	105116	105116	I	46	“ There , ”
105124	105143	105116	105116	I	46	“ That was honest . Would it help if I ’m with you when you talk to Trey ? ”
105144	105166	105090	105090	He	46	“ Yeah . I ’ll feel like a pussy for not doing it alone , but yeah , it ’d help . ”
105167	105174	105116	105116	I	46	“ Then I ’ll be there . ”
105191	105206	105175	105175	Cary	483	“ You really are always there for me . I love you for that . ”
105218	105225	105210	105210	I	46	“ I love you , too . ”
105253	105256	105246	105247	the man	483	“ Gideon . ”
105550	105556	105547	105547	I	46	“ Good morning , Mother . ”
105557	105568	105537	105537	my	46	“ Gideon . I ’m sorry to cancel on such short notice”—she
105572	105584	105537	105537	my	46	breath—“but I wo n’t be able to make lunch this afternoon . ”
105602	105607	105585	105585	I	46	“ That ’s fine . ”
105608	105616	105617	105617	she	1462	“ I ’m sure you ’re relieved , ”
105638	105658	105621	105621	I	46	“ Do n’t . If I did n’t want to have lunch with you , I would ’ve canceled . ”
105668	105675	105659	105659	She	1462	“ Have you seen Chris lately ? ”
105692	105698	105676	105676	I	46	“ I saw him Tuesday . ”
105699	105704	105712	105712	her	49	“ That long ago ? ”
105812	105818	105819	105819	I	46	“ I have to go , ”
105822	105829	105819	105819	I	46	“ I ’ll call you later . ”
105830	105835	105800	105800	She	49	“ You never do . ”
105847	105860	105836	105836	I	46	“ I would n’t say it if I did n’t mean it . ”
105880	105885	105886	105886	I	46	“ You look stunning , ”
105898	105921	105922	105922	she	252	“ For a man who claims not to know a damn thing about women , you sure know how to dress one , ”
105980	105991	106000	106000	her	252	“ I ’ve made mistakes , but I ’m learning . ”
106043	106049	106037	106037	She	46	“ Thank you for this . ”
106050	106054	106055	106055	I	46	“ My pleasure . ”
106063	106073	106055	106055	I	46	“ I have to talk to you about something . ”
106074	106083	106037	106037	She	46	“ Oh ? What ’s up , ace ? ”
106084	106095	106055	106055	I	46	“ Do you still have a Google alert on me ? ”
106102	106112	106096	106096	She	46	“ Is this when I should plead the Fifth ? ”
106113	106120	106121	106121	I	46	“ That wo n’t be necessary . ”
106131	106142	106121	106121	I	46	“ Corinne has sold a book about our time together . ”
106143	106146	106147	106147	Her	46	“ What ? ”
106170	106195	106156	106156	I	46	“ From what I read in the press release , she kept a diary during that time . She ’s also sharing personal photos . ”
106196	106211	106156	106156	I	46	“ Why ? Why would she sell that stuff for people to paw through ? ”
106233	106242	106220	106220	I	46	“ I do n’t think she knows why . ”
106243	106249	106156	106156	I	46	“ Can you stop it ? ”
106250	106273	106220	106220	I	46	“ No . However , if she lies outright and I can prove it , I can go after her for that . ”
106274	106282	106283	106283	Her	46	“ But only after it ’s released . ”
106292	106334	106283	106283	Her	46	“ She knows you ’ll have to read it . You ’ll have to see all the photos and read about how much she loves you . You ’ll read about things you did that you do n’t even remember now . ”
106335	106342	106343	106343	I	46	“ And it wo n’t matter . ”
106351	106385	106343	106343	I	46	“ I never loved her , not the way I do you . Looking back on that time is n’t going to make me suddenly wish I were with her and not you . ”
106386	106393	106394	106394	she	46	“ She did n’t push you , ”
106397	106403	106394	106394	she	46	“ Not like I do . ”
106429	106471	106423	106423	she	46	“ She also did n’t make me burn . Did n’t make me hunger , and hope , and dream like you do . There ’s no comparison , angel , and no going back . I would never want to . ”
106482	106494	106477	106477	She	46	“ The hits just keep on coming , do n’t they ? ”
106518	106523	106495	106495	I	46	“ Let ’em come . ”
106528	106535	106524	106524	She	46	“ Yeah , let ’em come . ”
106634	106637	106638	106638	I	46	“ Corinne . ”
106731	106742	106723	106723	I	46	“ I appreciate your taking the time to see me . ”
106743	106751	106776	106776	Eva	49	“ Your invitation was a pleasant surprise . ”
106752	106761	106762	106762	I	46	“ I do n’t believe it was unexpected . ”
106811	106818	106796	106796	she	54	“ No , I suppose not . ”
106831	106848	106827	106827	I	46	“ What are you doing ? You value your privacy as much as I do mine . ”
106858	106913	106849	106849	Corinne	54	“ I thought the exact same thing when I first saw that video of you and Eva arguing in the park . You say I do n’t know you , but I do , and having your private life splashed all over the tabloids is n’t something you would ever allow under normal circumstances . ”
106914	106919	106920	106920	I	46	“ What ’s normal ? ”
106976	107005	107025	107025	She	49	“ That ’s exactly my point — you do n’t remember . Because you ’re wrapped up in a passionate affair and you ca n’t see beyond it . ”
107006	107024	107079	107079	She	49	“ There is nothing beyond it , Corinne . I will be with her until I die . ”
107028	107073	107025	107025	She	49	“ You think so now , but stormy relationships do n’t last , Gideon . They burn themselves out . You like order and calm , and you wo n’t have that with her . Ever . Somewhere inside you , you know that . ”
107110	107124	107125	107125	I	46	“ So you ’ve sold a tell - all to do … what ? ”
107134	107143	107125	107125	I	46	“ Get back at me ? Hurt Eva ? ”
107144	107153	107171	107171	her	49	“ No . I want you to remember . ”
107154	107161	107125	107125	I	46	“ This is n’t the way . ”
107162	107168	107171	107171	her	49	“ What is the way ? ”
107174	107193	107169	107169	I	46	“ It ’s over , Corinne . Exposing your memories of us is n’t going to change that . ”
107194	107198	107199	107199	she	49	“ Maybe not , ”
107214	107271	107199	107199	she	49	“ But you said you never loved me . At the very least , I ’ll prove that wrong . I gave you comfort . Contentment . You were happy with me . I do n’t see that same sort of tranquillity when you ’re with her . You ca n’t tell me you feel it . ”
107272	107319	107169	107169	I	46	“ Everything you ’re saying tells me you do n’t care if I end up with you . But if you ’re leaving Giroux , maybe you care about the money . How much did they pay you to prostitute your ‘ love ’ for me ? ”
107324	107335	107320	107320	Her	1480	“ That ’s not why I ’m writing the book . ”
107336	107351	107199	107199	she	49	“ You just want to be sure I do n’t end up with Eva . ”
107352	107378	107320	107320	Her	1480	“ I just want you to be happy , Gideon . And since you ’ve met her , I ’ve seen you be anything but . ”
107400	107403	107397	107397	I	46	“ Golden . ”
107419	107429	107404	107404	Corinne	54	“ You gave Eva your mother ’s engagement ring . ”
107430	107441	107442	107442	She	54	“ It has n’t been hers for a long time . ”
107460	107472	107442	107442	She	54	“ Did you have it when you and I were together ? ”
107473	107476	107404	107404	Corinne	54	“ Yes . ”
107480	107492	107493	107493	I	46	“ You can tell yourself that Eva and I are incompatible , ”
107497	107556	107493	107493	I	46	“ that we ’re either fighting or fucking with nothing of substance in between . But the truth is that she ’s the other half of me and what you ’re doing is going to hurt her , which will hurt me . I ’ll buy you out of the publishing contract if you ’ll withdraw the book . ”
107566	107575	107557	107557	She	54	“ I … I ca n’t , Gideon . ”
107576	107581	107557	107557	She	54	“ Tell me why . ”
107582	107602	107557	107557	She	54	“ You ’re asking me to let you go . This is a way for me to do that . ”
107607	107629	107603	107603	I	46	“ I ’m asking you , Corinne , if you feel anything for me at all , to please drop this . ”
107630	107633	107557	107557	She	54	“ Gideon … ”
107634	107656	107603	107603	I	46	“ If you do n’t , you ’re going to turn what were good memories for me into something I hate . ”
107664	107669	107657	107657	Her	1481	“ I ’m sorry . ”
107679	107684	107670	107670	I	46	“ You will be . ”
107719	107723	107724	107724	I	46	“ Damn it . ”
107730	107736	107724	107724	I	46	“ God fucking damn it ! ”
107900	107909	107910	107910	Eva	49	“ I still want to see you tonight , ”
107924	107931	107932	107932	I	46	“ That ’s not in question , ”
107975	108001	107968	107968	August	228	“ You deal with Cary , I ’ll sit down with Arnoldo , and you and I will start the weekend when we ’re done . ”
108002	108023	108031	108031	She	49	“ God , this week just flew by . I need to work out . I skipped too many days . ”
108024	108030	107968	107968	August	228	“ Spar with me tomorrow . ”
108034	108039	108031	108031	She	49	“ Yeah , right . ”
108040	108046	108047	108047	I	46	“ I ’m not joking . ”
108068	108075	108076	108076	she	49	“ I ca n’t fight you ! ”
108079	108085	108031	108031	She	49	“ Of course you can . ”
108086	108097	108047	108047	I	46	“ You know too much . You ’re too good . ”
108098	108115	108031	108031	She	49	“ Let ’s put those self - defense skills of yours to the test , angel . ”
108137	108157	108131	108131	I	46	“ I want to know you can take care of yourself in the unlikely case that you have to . ”
108181	108196	108197	108197	she	49	“ I ’ve got wedding stuff tomorrow , but I ’ll think about it , ”
108200	108204	108197	108197	she	49	“ Hang on . ”
108238	108240	108217	108217	She	49	“ You know”—she
108241	108278	108217	108217	She	49	sighed—“I’m putting on a brave face for Cary , but I ’m worried about what ’s going to happen with Trey . If he walks out , I think Cary just might totally self - destruct . ”
108279	108286	108287	108287	I	46	“ He ’s asking a lot , ”
108298	108348	108287	108287	I	46	“ Cary ’s basically telling this guy that he ’s got a pregnant sidepiece that he intends to hang on to . No , scratch that . He ’s saying that Trey is going to be the sidepiece . I ca n’t see that going over well with anyone . ”
108349	108353	108217	108217	She	49	“ I know . ”
108354	108372	108287	108287	I	46	“ I ’ll have my phone on me all night . Call me if you need me . ”
108373	108397	108217	108217	She	49	“ I always need you . I ’m home , so I have to go . See you later . I love you . ”
108447	108458	108430	108431	Mark Garrity	757	“ Mark , thank you for making time for me . ”
108470	108508	108459	108459	He	757	“ I ’m the one feeling thankful , Mr. Cross . There are a large number of people in this city — in the world , actually — who’d kill to be where I am right now . ”
108509	108516	108517	108517	I	46	“ Call me Gideon , please . ”
108524	108529	108517	108517	I	46	“ How ’s Steven ? ”
108530	108553	108459	108459	He	757	“ He ’s doing great , thank you . I ’m beginning to think he missed a calling as a wedding planner . ”
108557	108568	108554	108554	I	46	“ Eva ’s about to dig into that this weekend . ”
108613	108626	108627	108627	he	757	“ If she has half as much fun with it as Steven , ”
108630	108640	108627	108627	he	757	“ she ’ll have the time of her life . ”
108641	108653	108654	108654	I	46	“ Let ’s hope she does n’t have too much fun , ”
108662	108677	108654	108654	I	46	“ I ’d like to get past the planning and into the actual wedding . ”
108681	108690	108691	108691	I	46	“ Can I get you something to drink ? ”
108694	108701	108627	108627	he	757	“ I ’m good , thanks . ”
108702	108711	108712	108712	I	46	“ Okay . I ’ll make this quick . ”
108717	108754	108712	108712	I	46	“ I asked you to meet me after work , because it would n’t be appropriate for me to offer you a position with Cross Industries while you ’re on Waters Field and Leaman ’s time . ”
108771	108806	108760	108760	I	46	“ Cross Industries has a number of diverse international holdings , with a concentration on real estate , entertainment , and premium brands — or assets we believe we can elevate to that status . ”
108807	108812	108627	108627	he	757	“ Like Kingsman Vodka . ”
108813	108869	108760	108760	I	46	“ Precisely . For the most part , advertising and marketing campaigns are managed on the ground level , but brand overhauls or adjustments to messaging are approved here . Due to the diversity I mentioned , we ’re always reviewing new strategies for rebranding or strengthening an established brand . We could use you . ”
108870	108873	108874	108874	Mark	757	“ Wow . ”
108882	108900	108874	108874	Mark	757	“ I ’m not sure what I was expecting , but this has caught me off guard . ”
108901	108915	108760	108760	I	46	“ I ’ll pay you twice what you ’re making , to start . ”
108916	108925	108874	108874	Mark	757	“ That ’s a hell of an offer . ”
108926	108938	108760	108760	I	46	“ I ’m not a man who likes the word no . ”
108943	108964	108939	108939	His	757	“ I doubt you hear it very often . I guess this means Eva is leaving Waters Field and Leaman ? ”
108965	108974	108874	108874	Mark	757	“ She has n’t made that decision yet . ”
108975	108978	108979	108979	His	757	“ No ? ”
108985	108996	108979	108979	His	757	“ If I leave , she ’ll lose her job . ”
108997	109007	109008	109008	I	46	“ And gain another one here , of course . ”
109034	109048	108979	108979	His	757	“ Is she waiting for me to agree before she takes any steps ? ”
109049	109057	109058	109058	Mark	757	“ Your decision will be a catalyst . ”
109066	109076	109058	109058	Mark	757	“ I ’m both flattered and excited , but — ”
109077	109091	109092	109092	I	46	“ I understand it ’s not a move you were planning on making , ”
109096	109143	109092	109092	I	46	“ You ’re happy where you ’re at , and feel a measure of job security . So I ’m prepared to guarantee you the position — and reasonable bonuses and annual raises — for the next three years , barring any misconduct on your part . ”
109168	109200	109162	109162	I	46	“ All the information is laid out in detail in this . Take it home with you , discuss it with Steven , and let me know your decision on Monday . ”
109201	109204	109092	109092	I	46	“ Monday ? ”
109208	109245	109205	109205	I	46	“ I expect you ’ll want to give Waters Field and Leaman ample notice and I do n’t have a problem with that , but I ’ll need to have your commitment as soon as possible . ”
109257	109264	109246	109246	He	303	“ What if I have questions ? ”
109265	109276	109277	109277	I	46	“ Call me . My card is in the folder . ”
109286	109296	109277	109277	I	46	“ I ’m sorry . I have another appointment . ”
109297	109305	109306	109306	Mark	757	“ Oh , yes , of course . ”
109312	109350	109306	109306	Mark	757	“ I ’m sorry . This happened so fast I feel like I have n’t quite processed it all yet . I understand you ’ve offered me a fantastic opportunity , though , and I appreciate that . ”
109351	109360	109361	109361	I	46	“ You ’re good at what you do , ”
109366	109388	109361	109361	I	46	“ I would n’t make the offer if you were n’t worth it . Think about it , then say yes . ”
109392	109409	109389	109389	He	303	“ I ’ll give it some serious thought and you ’ll hear from me on Monday . ”
109437	109447	109451	109451	Arnoldo	97	“ SHE started crying the minute you walked out . ”
109472	109483	109466	109466	I	46	“ Do you want me to feel guilty about that ? ”
109484	109510	109448	109448	I	46	“ No . I would n’t feel sorry for her , either . But I thought you should know that Corinne is n’t completely heartless . ”
109511	109530	109466	109466	I	46	“ I never thought she was . I just thought she ’d given that heart to her husband . ”
109647	109652	109653	109653	Arnoldo	97	“ You look tired , ”
109656	109665	109666	109666	I	46	“ It ’s been one of those weeks . ”
109671	109679	109666	109666	I	46	“ No , it ’s not Eva . ”
109680	109689	109642	109642	she	49	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”
109690	109715	109666	109666	I	46	“ Nothing to say , really . I should ’ve been smarter . I let the world see how much she means to me . ”
109716	109731	109732	109732	He	97	“ Passionate kisses on the street , even more passionate fights in the park . ”
109736	109750	109732	109732	He	97	“ What is it they say ? Wearing your heart on your sleeve ? ”
109751	109782	109666	109666	I	46	“ I opened the door , now everyone wants to walk through it . She ’s the most direct way to fuck with my head , and everyone knows it . ”
109783	109788	109732	109732	He	97	“ Including Brett Kline ? ”
109789	109798	109666	109666	I	46	“ He ’s not an issue any longer . ”
109814	109822	109811	109811	He	97	“ I ’m glad , my friend . ”
109823	109827	109828	109828	I	46	“ So am I. ”
109833	109840	109828	109828	I	46	“ What ’s new with you ? ”
109876	109887	109872	109874	Lana Del Rey	231	“ The restaurant is doing well , as you know . ”
109888	109903	109841	109841	He	97	“ Yes , I ’m very pleased . Exceeded profit projections in every way . ”
109904	109940	109872	109874	Lana Del Rey	231	“ We just filmed some promotional teasers for the new season earlier this week . Once the Food Network starts airing them and the new episodes , we should see a nice boost in business . ”
109941	109951	109841	109841	He	97	“ I can always say I knew you when . ”
110056	110061	110062	110062	I	46	“ OH MY GOD , ”
110072	110077	110062	110062	I	46	“ this is divine . ”
110086	110108	110078	110078	Kristin	342	“ It ’s one of my favorites , too . Hold on , though . The butter vanilla is even better . ”
110109	110114	110115	110115	My	46	“ Vanilla over chocolate ? ”
110126	110130	110115	110115	My	46	“ No way . ”
110131	110137	110138	110138	Kristin	342	“ I would usually agree , ”
110145	110161	110138	110138	Kristin	342	“ but this bakery made me a convert . The lemon is also very good . ”
110371	110379	110380	110380	Kristin	342	“ What are your floral arrangement preferences ? ”
110459	110462	110463	110463	I	46	“ Red , ”
110475	110479	110463	110463	I	46	“ Anything red . ”
110480	110483	110491	110491	her	342	“ Red ? ”
110494	110515	110491	110491	her	342	“ How garish , Eva . It ’s your first wedding . Go with white , cream , and gold . ”
110521	110532	110516	110516	I	46	“ How many weddings do you expect me to have ? ”
110533	110549	110491	110491	her	342	“ That ’s not what I meant . You ’re a first - time bride . ”
110550	110561	110562	110562	I	46	“ I ’m not talking about wearing a red dress , ”
110565	110578	110562	110562	I	46	“ I ’m just saying the primary accent color should be red . ”
110579	110601	110491	110491	her	342	“ I do n’t see how that will work , honey . And I ’ve put together enough weddings to know . ”
110671	110684	110685	110685	Kristin	342	“ Let me show you what red can look like , Monica , ”
110697	110749	110685	110685	Kristin	342	“ Red can be amazing , especially with evening weddings . The important thing is that the ceremony and reception represent both the bride and groom . To have a truly memorable day , it ’s important that we visually convey their style , history , and hopes for the future . ”
110767	110776	110750	110751	My mother	342	“ Eva … you ca n’t be serious . ”
110839	110850	110853	110853	I	46	“ I ’m sure there ’s a compromise , Mom . ”
110868	110878	110879	110879	Kristin	342	“ Do we have an idea of the budget ? ”
110906	110914	110915	110915	I	46	“ Fifty thousand for the ceremony itself , ”
110919	110927	110915	110915	I	46	“ Minus the cost of the dress . ”
110958	110971	110943	110943	her	342	“ My God , Eva . What a time to make jokes ! ”
110972	110982	110983	110983	I	46	“ Dad ’s paying for the wedding , Mom , ”
111024	111040	111020	111020	her	342	“ Your dress alone will cost more than that . The flowers , the venue … ”
111041	111050	111051	111051	I	46	“ We ’re getting married on the beach , ”
111061	111092	111051	111051	I	46	“ North Carolina . The Outer Banks . At the house Gideon and I just bought . We ’ll only need enough flowers for the members of the wedding party . ”
111093	111099	111100	111101	My mom	342	“ You do n’t understand . ”
111108	111123	111100	111101	My mom	342	“ There ’s no way that would work . You ’d have no control . ”
111129	111133	111134	111134	she	342	“ Unpredictable weather , ”
111138	111172	111134	111134	she	342	“ sand everywhere … Plus , asking everyone to travel that far out of the city will make it likely some wo n’t be able to attend . And where would everyone stay ? ”
111173	111219	111125	111125	she	342	“ Who ’s everyone ? I told you , the ceremony is going to be small , for friends and family only . Gideon ’s taking care of travel . I ’m sure he ’d be happy to take care of lodging arrangements , too . ”
111220	111227	111228	111228	Kristin	342	“ I can help with that , ”
111231	111237	111238	111239	my mother	342	“ Do n’t encourage her ! ”
111242	111248	111249	111249	I	46	“ Do n’t be rude ! ”
111253	111270	111249	111249	I	46	“ I think you ’re forgetting that it ’s my wedding . Not a publicity op . ”
111280	111331	111271	111272	My mom	342	“ Eva , I think it ’s very sweet that you want to accommodate your father this way , but he does n’t understand what a burden he ’s placing on you by asking this . Even if I matched him dollar for dollar , it would n’t be enough — ”
111332	111337	111338	111338	My	46	“ It ’s plenty . ”
111358	111366	111338	111338	My	46	“ And it ’s not a burden . ”
111367	111402	111271	111272	My mom	342	“ You ’re going to offend people . You have to understand that a man in Gideon ’s position needs to take every opportunity to solidify his network . He ’s going to want — ”
111403	111408	111409	111409	I	46	“ — to elope , ”
111424	111453	111409	111409	I	46	“ If he had his way , we ’d run off somewhere and get married on a remote beach with a couple of witnesses and a great view . ”
111454	111460	111271	111272	My mom	342	“ He may say that — ”
111461	111477	111409	111409	I	46	“ No , Mother . Trust me . That ’s exactly what he would do . ”
111478	111485	111486	111486	Kristin	342	“ Um , if I may . ”
111490	111549	111486	111486	Kristin	342	“ We can make this work , Monica . Many celebrity weddings are private affairs . A limited budget will keep us focused on the details . And , if Gideon and Eva are open to it , we can arrange to have select photographs sold to the celebrity lifestyle magazines , with the profits going to charity . ”
111550	111557	111558	111558	I	46	“ Oh , I like that ! ”
111589	111603	111604	111604	she	342	“ I ’ve dreamed of your wedding since the day you were born , ”
111608	111621	111604	111604	she	342	“ I always wanted you to have something fit for a princess . ”
111622	111625	111626	111626	I	46	“ Mom . ”
111636	111677	111626	111626	I	46	“ You can go wild with the reception , okay ? Do whatever you want . Skip the red , invite the world , whatever . As for the wedding , is n’t it enough that I found my prince ? ”
111695	111704	111684	111684	she	342	“ I guess it ’ll have to be . ”
111864	111869	111870	111870	I	46	“ Hi , Trey , ”
111873	111878	111870	111870	I	46	“ How are you ? ”
111879	111884	111885	111885	He	1942	“ Hey , Eva . ”
111889	111903	111885	111885	He	1942	“ I have no idea how I am . How are you doing ? ”
111904	111952	111870	111870	I	46	“ Well , I ’m just leaving my mother ’s place after spending hours talking about the wedding . It did n’t go as badly as it could have , but it could ’ve been smoother . But that ’s pretty usual when dealing with my mom . ”
111953	111974	111885	111885	He	1942	“ Ah … well , you ’ve got a lot on your plate . I ’m sorry to bother you . ”
111975	111998	111870	111870	I	46	“ Trey . It ’s fine . I ’m glad you called . If you want to talk , I ’m here . ”
111999	112014	111885	111885	He	1942	“ Could we get together , maybe ? Whenever it ’s convenient for you ? ”
112015	112020	111870	111870	I	46	“ How ’s now ? ”
112021	112066	111885	111885	He	1942	“ Really ? I ’m at a street fair on the west side . My sister dragged me out and I was miserable company . She ditched me a few minutes ago and now I ’m wondering what the hell I ’m doing here . ”
112067	112073	111870	111870	I	46	“ I can meet you . ”
112074	112098	111885	111885	He	1942	“ I ’m between Eighty - second and Eighty - third , close to Amsterdam . It ’s packed here , just FYI . ”
112099	112113	111870	111870	I	46	“ Okay , hang tight . I ’ll see you in a few . ”
112114	112119	111885	111885	He	1942	“ Thanks , Eva . ”
112134	112147	112124	112124	I	46	“ Amsterdam and Eighty - second . Close as you can get . ”
112151	112154	112155	112155	I	46	“ Thanks . ”
112293	112296	112297	112297	he	46	“ Angel , ”
112300	112308	112297	112297	he	46	“ Are you on your way home ? ”
112309	112329	112278	112278	I	46	“ Not quite . I ’m done at my mom ’s , but I ’m going to meet Trey . ”
112330	112337	112297	112297	he	46	“ How long will that take ? ”
112338	112368	112278	112278	I	46	“ I ’m not sure . Not more than an hour , I think . God , I hope he does n’t tell me he ’s done with Cary . ”
112369	112378	112297	112297	he	46	“ How did it go with your mother ? ”
112379	112396	112397	112397	I	46	“ I told her we were getting married on the beach by the Outer Banks house . ”
112400	112412	112397	112397	I	46	“ I ’m sorry . I should ’ve asked you first . ”
112413	112422	112423	112423	His	46	“ I think that ’s an excellent idea . ”
112438	112461	112423	112423	His	46	“ She asked me how we ’re planning on lodging everyone . I kinda dropped that on you and the wedding planner . ”
112462	112473	112423	112423	His	46	“ That ’s fine . We ’ll work something out . ”
112485	112489	112423	112423	His	46	“ Thank you . ”
112490	112499	112500	112500	he	46	“ So the big hurdle ’s behind you , ”
112510	112551	112423	112423	His	46	“ Well , I do n’t know about that . She got all teary about it . You know , she had big dreams that are n’t coming true . I hope she lets them go and gets on board . ”
112552	112570	112423	112423	His	46	“ What about her family ? We have n’t talked about making arrangements for them to come . ”
112582	112626	112571	112571	I	46	“ They ’re not invited . The only things I know about them are what I found with a Google search . They disowned my mom when she got pregnant with me , so they ’ve never been a part of my life . ”
112627	112633	112634	112634	he	46	“ All right , then , ”
112638	112651	112634	112634	he	46	“ I ’ve got a surprise for you when you get home . ”
112652	112655	112656	112656	My	46	“ Oh ? ”
112661	112669	112656	112656	My	46	“ Will you give me a hint ? ”
112670	112686	112571	112571	I	46	“ Of course not . You ’ll have to hurry home if you ’re curious . ”
112690	112693	112687	112687	I	46	“ Tease . ”
112694	112703	112656	112656	My	46	“ Teases do n’t deliver . I do . ”
112715	112726	112704	112704	My	46	“ I ’ll be home as soon as I can . ”
112727	112733	112734	112734	he	46	“ I ’ll be waiting , ”
113002	113009	113010	113010	Trey	1942	“ I ’m a fucking mess , ”
113016	113021	113022	113022	I	46	“ You ’re normal . ”
113036	113044	113022	113022	I	46	“ Anyone would be reeling right now . ”
113059	113134	113045	113045	He	1942	“ I do n’t think I can do this , Eva . I do n’t think I should . I want someone in my life full - time , someone who ’s there to support me while I get through school , then try to build my practice . Cary ’s going to be supporting that model instead and fitting me in when he can . How am I not going to resent that ? ”
113135	113142	113143	113143	I	46	“ That ’s a valid question , ”
113155	113174	113143	113143	I	46	“ You know Cary wo n’t be sure the baby is his until a paternity test is done . ”
113180	113193	113175	113175	Trey	1942	“ I do n’t think it ’ll matter . He seems invested . ”
113194	113249	113175	113175	Trey	1942	“ I think it ’ll matter . Maybe he wo n’t just walk away , maybe he ’ll play uncle or something . I do n’t know . For now , we have to go with the assumption that he ’s the dad , but maybe he ’s not . It ’s a possibility . ”
113250	113265	113175	113175	Trey	1942	“ So you ’re telling me to hang in there for another six months ? ”
113266	113353	113175	113175	Trey	1942	“ No . If you want me to give you answers , I do n’t have any . All I can tell you for sure is that Cary loves you , more than I ’ve ever seen him love anyone . If he loses you , it ’s going to break him . I ’m not trying to guilt you into staying with him . I just think you should know that if you leave , you ’re not the only one who ’ll be hurting . ”
113354	113360	113175	113175	Trey	1942	“ How is that helpful ? ”
113361	113367	113368	113368	I	46	“ Maybe it ’s not . ”
113376	113410	113368	113368	I	46	“ Maybe I ’m just small enough to find that comforting . If Gideon and I did n’t work out , I ’d want to know he was as miserable as I was . ”
113420	113453	113411	113411	Trey	1942	“ Yeah , I see your point . Would you stay with him if you found out he ’d knocked someone else up ? Someone he was sleeping with while dating you ? ”
113454	113503	113411	113411	Trey	1942	“ I thought about that . It ’s hard for me to imagine not being with Gideon . If we were n’t exclusive at the time and the woman was in his past , if he was with me and not her , maybe I could handle it . ”
113524	113545	113504	113504	I	46	“ But if he was mostly with her and seeing me on the side … I think I ’d walk . ”
113578	113583	113659	113659	he	483	“ Thanks , Eva . ”
113584	113654	113659	113659	he	483	“ For what it ’s worth , I would n’t think less of you if you toughed it out with Cary . It ’s not weak to stand by the person you love when they ’re trying to fix a big mistake , and it ’s not weak to decide to put yourself first . Whatever decision you make , I ’ll still think you ’re a helluva guy . ”
113667	113672	113659	113659	he	483	“ Thanks , Eva . ”
113680	113685	113673	113673	I	46	“ You ’re welcome . ”
113686	113697	113698	113698	Raúl	46	“ I’LL go get the car and pull it around , ”
113711	113723	113724	113724	I	46	“ Okay . I ’m just going to check the mail . ”
113919	113922	113923	113923	I	46	“ Hey ! ”
113937	113942	113964	113964	his	238	“ Everything all right ? ”
113953	113961	113943	113943	I	46	“ Do you know who that was ? ”
113967	113974	113962	113962	He	238	“ She does n’t live here . ”
113987	113991	113992	113992	she	1545	“ A redhead ? ”
113998	114021	113992	113992	she	1545	“ We have n’t had any visitors who came in without a tenant today , so I have n’t really paid attention . ”
114022	114030	114048	114049	the concierge	1293	“ Hmm . Okay , thank you . ”
114031	114039	114040	114040	Louie	238	“ Your car ’s here , Eva , ”
114133	114136	114137	114137	he	1293	“ Angel , ”
114164	114168	114153	114153	He	1293	“ Come here . ”
114190	114200	114201	114201	I	46	“ You ’re going to think I ’m crazy , ”
114207	114224	114201	114201	I	46	“ but I could swear I just saw Anne Lucas in the lobby of my building . ”
114238	114241	114242	114242	he	1293	“ When ? ”
114246	114260	114234	114236	his favorite person	1555	“ Twenty minutes ago , maybe . Right before I came over here . ”
114289	114301	114302	114302	he	1293	“ Mrs. Cross just saw Anne Lucas in her apartment building , ”
114308	114314	114315	114315	I	46	“ I think I did , ”
114332	114336	114337	114337	he	1293	“ Find out , ”
114344	114352	114325	114325	he	1293	“ Gideon . What ’s going on ? ”
114377	114385	114386	114386	he	1293	“ I saw Anne the other day , ”
114395	114449	114386	114386	he	1293	“ Raúl confirmed that the woman who spoke to you at the fund - raiser was her . She admitted it , and I warned her to stay away from you , but she wo n’t . She wants to hurt me and she knows she can do that if she hurts you . ”
114450	114453	114454	114454	I	46	“ Okay . ”
114458	114480	114386	114386	he	1293	“ You need to tell Raúl the moment you see her anywhere . Even if you just think it ’s her . ”
114481	114503	114386	114386	he	1293	“ Hold on a minute , ace . You went to see her the other day and did n’t tell me ? ”
114504	114511	114386	114386	he	1293	“ I ’m telling you now . ”
114512	114521	114386	114386	he	1293	“ Why did n’t you tell me then ? ”
114526	114535	114522	114522	He	46	“ It was the day Chris came over . ”
114536	114539	114386	114386	he	1293	“ Oh . ”
114540	114543	114522	114522	He	46	“ Yeah . ”
114553	114560	114544	114544	I	46	“ How would she hurt me ? ”
114561	114577	114386	114386	he	1293	“ I do n’t know . It ’s enough for me that she wants to . ”
114578	114589	114544	114544	I	46	“ Like would she break my leg ? My nose ? ”
114590	114599	114600	114600	he	46	“ I doubt she ’d resort to violence , ”
114604	114630	114600	114600	he	46	“ It would be more fun for her to play mind games . Showing up where you are . Letting you catch glimpses of her . ”
114636	114652	114653	114653	I	46	“ So that you ’ll go to her . That ’s what she really wants , ”
114656	114663	114653	114653	I	46	“ She wants to see you . ”
114664	114679	114737	114737	He	46	“ I wo n’t be obliging her . I said what I needed to . ”
114694	114736	114687	114687	I	46	“ Anne , Corinne , Deanna … It ’s a bit crazy , Gideon . I mean , I do n’t think this is normal for most men . How many more women are going to lose their minds over you ? ”
114748	114794	114737	114737	He	46	“ I do n’t know what ’s gotten into Corinne . None of what she ’s done since she returned to New York is like her . I do n’t know if it ’s the medication she was on , the miscarriage , her divorce … ”
114795	114801	114877	114877	he	1560	“ She ’s getting divorced ? ”
114802	114867	114737	114737	He	46	“ Do n’t take that tone , Eva . It does n’t make a damn bit of difference to me if she ’s married or single . I ’m married . That ’s never going to change , and I ’m not a man who cheats . I have more respect for you — and me — than to be that kind of husband . ”
114907	114946	114897	114897	Gideon	339	“ As for the other two … You have to understand that Deanna was collateral damage . Fuck . My entire life has been a war zone and some people have gotten caught in the line of fire . ”
114976	115013	114972	114972	He	1560	“ If I had n’t used Deanna to send a message to Anne that the door was closed between us , she would ’ve been just a one - night stand . Over and done with . ”
115014	115021	114972	114972	He	1560	“ But she ’s okay now ? ”
115022	115027	115028	115028	His	1560	“ I think so . ”
115044	115090	115028	115028	His	1560	“ Since I ’m sharing , I ’ll say that I do n’t think she ’d turn me down if I tried to hook up — which I won’t — but I do n’t think she falls in the woman - scorned category any longer . ”
115091	115144	114972	114972	He	1560	“ Yeah , I knew she ’d hit the sheets with you again if she could . Not that I blame her . Do you have to be so damn good in bed ? Is n’t it enough that you ’re hot , and have an amazing body and a huge cock ? ”
115153	115159	115145	115145	He	1560	“ It ’s not huge . ”
115160	115214	115028	115028	His	1560	“ Whatever . You ’re hung . And you know how to use it . And women do n’t get awesome sex very often , so when we do , we can go a little nuts over it . I guess that answers my question about Anne , since she had you repeatedly . ”
115215	115221	115222	115222	Gideon	339	“ She never had me . ”
115230	115248	115222	115222	Gideon	339	“ At some point you ’re going to get sick of hearing what an asshole I am . ”
115262	115286	115249	115249	I	46	“ You ’re not the first insanely hot guy on the planet to use women . And you wo n’t be the last . ”
115287	115294	115295	115295	he	1560	“ It was different with Anne , ”
115298	115307	115295	115295	he	1560	“ It was n’t just about her husband . ”
115340	115348	115349	115349	he	1560	“ She reminds me of Hugh sometimes , ”
115355	115383	115349	115349	he	1560	“ The way she moves , some of the things she says … There ’s a familial resemblance . And more . I ca n’t explain it . ”
115384	115389	115331	115331	He	1560	“ Then do n’t . ”
115390	115437	115349	115349	he	1560	“ Sometimes the line between them blurred in my mind . It was like I was punishing Hugh through Anne . I did things to her I ’ve never done with anyone else . Things that made me feel sick when I thought about them later . ”
115438	115441	115442	115442	I	46	“ Gideon . ”
115496	115519	115492	115492	Gideon	339	“ It was twisted between Anne and me . I twisted her . If I could go back and do things differently — ”
115520	115534	115492	115492	Gideon	339	“ We ’ll deal with it . I ’m glad you told me . ”
115535	115592	115492	115492	Gideon	339	“ Had to . Listen , angel , you need to tell Raúl the moment you see her anywhere . Even if you ’re not sure . And do n’t go anywhere alone . I ’ll figure out how to deal with her . In the meantime , I need to know that you ’re safe . ”
115593	115596	115597	115597	I	46	“ Okay . ”
115682	115685	115686	115686	I	46	“ So , ”
115703	115709	115686	115686	I	46	“ Where ’s my surprise ? ”
115710	115713	115718	115718	his	46	“ Well … ”
115722	115739	115718	115718	his	46	“ Let ’s wait a bit before that . How about we start with some wine ? ”
115751	115761	115745	115745	I	46	“ Are you trying to seduce me , ace ? ”
115767	115770	115762	115762	He	46	“ Always . ”
115771	115778	115762	115762	He	46	“ Umm … Go right ahead . ”
116051	116054	116055	116055	I	46	“ Gideon ? ”
116080	116083	116055	116055	I	46	“ Hmm ? ”
116098	116116	116084	116084	I	46	“ Would you mind if I fucked myself on your big cock while you ’re watching TV ? ”
116125	116136	116137	116137	he	46	“ I might not be able to see around you , ”
116143	116156	116137	116137	he	46	“ Maybe you better get on your knees and suck it instead . ”
116177	116182	116171	116171	I	46	“ You ’re terrible ! ”
116183	116188	116189	116189	he	46	“ My poor angel , ”
116192	116197	116189	116189	he	46	“ Are you horny ? ”
116198	116204	116205	116205	I	46	“ What do you think ? ”
116272	116277	116258	116258	He	46	“ Are you wet ? ”
116304	116312	116313	116313	I	46	“ Why do n’t you find out ? ”
116316	116320	116313	116313	I	46	“ Show me . ”
116464	116468	116469	116469	he	46	“ No panties , ”
116478	116487	116469	116469	he	46	“ You ’re a bad girl , angel . ”
116491	116499	116488	116488	I	46	“ I ’m trying to be good . ”
116500	116506	116507	116507	he	46	“ Open yourself for me , ”
116510	116516	116488	116488	I	46	“ Let me see you . ”
116517	116520	116488	116488	I	46	“ Gideon … ”
116632	116642	116628	116628	Gideon	339	“ You have such a pretty cunt , Eva . ”
116668	116673	116674	116674	he	46	“ Do n’t move , ”
116686	116690	116691	116691	I	46	“ Oh God , ”
116698	116702	116703	116703	he	46	“ Sit down , ”
116781	116787	116765	116765	His	46	“ You could be wetter . ”
116896	116903	116904	116904	I	46	“ I ’m going to come , ”
116907	116918	116904	116904	I	46	“ Gideon … God … I ’m going to come . ”
116963	116967	116968	116968	I	46	“ Fuck me , ”
116979	116983	116971	116971	Gideon	339	“ Not here . ”
117033	117036	117039	117039	his	46	“ Gideon ! ”
117125	117129	117130	117130	I	46	“ Why here ? ”
117167	117171	117172	117172	he	46	“ Turn around , ”
117457	117467	117452	117452	he	46	“ How do you feel , looking at that ? ”
117473	117480	117468	117468	I	46	“ Intrigued . A little apprehensive . ”
117488	117501	117481	117481	His	46	“ Let ’s see how you feel once you ’re in it . ”
117547	117583	117481	117481	His	46	“ I want to do this right , Eva . Not like that night in the elevator . I want you to feel it when I ’m in control and we ’re in it together . ”
117621	117630	117631	117631	he	46	“ What ’s your safe word , angel ? ”
117654	117657	117616	117617	a cop	424	“ Crossfire . ”
117658	117671	117631	117631	he	46	“ You say the word and everything stops . Say it again . ”
117672	117675	117616	117617	a cop	424	“ Crossfire . ”
117688	117723	117676	117676	His	46	“ There ’s nothing to be afraid of . You just have to sit back and take my cock . I ’m going to make you come without you having to do a thing . ”
117730	117743	117724	117724	I	46	“ I feel like that ’s always how it is between us . ”
117744	117750	117751	117751	he	46	“ Try it this way , ”
117763	117778	117751	117751	he	46	“ If you do n’t like it , we ’ll hit the bed instead . ”
117813	117816	117817	117817	he	46	“ Crossfire , ”
117955	117958	117959	117959	I	46	“ Okay , ”
117963	117966	117959	117959	I	46	“ Okay . ”
118114	118118	118119	118119	he	46	“ You settled ? ”
118152	118171	118141	118141	He	46	“ I ’m going to secure your ankles . You tell me if anything does n’t feel right . ”
118172	118176	118177	118177	My	46	“ All right . ”
118252	118257	118247	118247	He	46	“ Okay so far ? ”
118258	118265	118266	118266	I	46	“ You ’ve done this before . ”
118360	118366	118343	118343	His	46	“ Still good , angel ? ”
118410	118417	118418	118418	I	46	“ You are so fucking hot , ”
118445	118454	118427	118427	He	46	“ I think you ’ll really enjoy this . ”
118632	118637	118638	118638	he	46	“ You trust me , ”
118655	118658	118651	118651	I	46	“ Yes . ”
118662	118667	118659	118659	Gideon	339	“ Grab the chains . ”
118865	118871	118872	118872	he	46	“ Do n’t let go , ”
119022	119025	119026	119026	he	46	“ Fuck , ”
119029	119036	119026	119026	he	46	“ Your cunt is so good . ”
119071	119074	119075	119075	I	46	“ Please , ”
119079	119088	119089	119089	he	46	“ I told you not to let go , ”
119100	119105	119106	119106	I	46	“ I wo n’t , ”
119148	119153	119154	119154	he	46	“ Talk to me , ”
119158	119165	119154	119154	he	46	“ Tell me you like this . ”
119166	119170	119171	119171	I	46	“ Damn it , ”
119181	119186	119171	119171	I	46	“ Do n’t stop . ”
119410	119416	119417	119417	I	46	“ You did n’t come , ”
119442	119460	119431	119431	Gideon	339	“ I ’m going to restrain your wrists . Then I ’m going to come in you . ”
119468	119472	119461	119461	My	46	“ Oh God . ”
119473	119478	119479	119479	he	46	“ You trust me , ”
119515	119520	119512	119512	his	46	“ More than anything . ”
119522	119528	119512	119512	his	46	“ GOOD MORNING , ACE . ”
119598	119604	119588	119588	I	46	“ How are you feeling ? ”
119605	119608	119588	119588	I	46	“ Umm … ”
119619	119624	119625	119625	she	49	“ I ’m sore , ”
119636	119640	119625	119625	she	49	“ Deep inside . ”
119711	119714	119715	119715	she	49	“ Jeez , ”
119718	119729	119715	119715	she	49	“ Look at that cocky smirk . Men are pigs . ”
119730	119744	119715	119715	she	49	“ And here I am , slaving over a hot stove for you . ”
119745	119750	119751	119751	She	49	“ Yeah , yeah . ”
119790	119797	119775	119775	she	49	“ You were amazing last night . ”
119869	119881	119882	119882	she	49	“ I ’ve been wanting to talk to you about something , ”
119901	119904	119897	119897	My	46	“ Okay . ”
119905	119921	119882	119882	she	49	“ I ’d like to become involved with the Crossroads Foundation — financially and administratively . ”
119922	119941	119897	119897	My	46	“ That could encompass a lot of things , angel . Tell me what you have in mind . ”
119950	120021	119944	119944	she	49	“ I ’ve been thinking about the settlement money I got from Nathan ’s dad . It ’s just sitting in the bank , and after what Megumi has been through … I ’ve realized that I need to put that money to work and I do n’t want to wait . I ’d like to help fund the programs offered by Crossroads and help brainstorm ways to expand them . ”
120036	120046	120022	120022	I	46	“ All right . We ’ll work something out . ”
120047	120050	120051	120051	She	49	“ Yeah ? ”
120064	120080	120022	120022	I	46	“ Of course . I ’d like to commit more time to it , too . ”
120081	120087	120088	120088	She	49	“ We can work together ! ”
120094	120103	120088	120088	She	49	“ I ’m excited about this , Gideon . ”
120110	120115	120104	120104	I	46	“ I can tell . ”
120116	120134	120135	120135	She	49	“ It just feels like a natural progression for us . An extension of us , really . ”
120153	120156	120157	120157	she	49	“ Yummy , ”
120160	120168	120157	120157	she	49	“ I ’m glad you like it . ”
120169	120184	120205	120205	she	49	“ You ’re hot and you can cook . I ’m a lucky girl . ”
120389	120403	120387	120387	Leaman	46	“ I have to talk to you about something , too , angel . ”
120404	120410	120456	120456	her	49	“ I ’m all ears . ”
120427	120435	120415	120415	I	46	“ I offered Mark Garrity a job . ”
120447	120452	120456	120456	her	49	“ You did what ? ”
120484	120495	120496	120496	I	46	“ I ’ve asked Mark to work for Cross Industries , ”
120503	120506	120499	120499	Her	49	“ When ? ”
120507	120510	120499	120499	Her	49	“ Friday . ”
120511	120514	120515	120515	she	49	“ Friday , ”
120518	120531	120515	120515	she	49	“ It ’s Sunday . You ’re just bringing this up now ? ”
120559	120564	120499	120499	Her	49	“ Why , Gideon ? ”
120589	120605	120576	120576	I	46	“ He ’s a solid employee . He ’ll bring a lot to the team . ”
120606	120609	120615	120615	her	49	“ Bullshit . ”
120622	120651	120615	120615	her	49	“ Do n’t patronize me . You ’re putting me out of a job and you did n’t think that was something you should discuss with me first ? ”
120656	120667	120652	120652	I	46	“ LanCorp asked for Mark directly , did n’t they ? ”
120674	120691	120668	120668	She	49	“ That ’s what this is about ? The PhazeOne system ? Are you fucking serious ? ”
120732	120742	120692	120692	I	46	“ You did n’t answer my question , Eva . ”
120743	120751	120752	120752	she	49	“ What the hell does it matter ? ”
120755	120786	120752	120752	she	49	“ Yeah , they asked for Mark . So what ? You do n’t want your competitors using him ? Are you trying to say this was a business decision ? ”
120787	120794	120795	120795	I	46	“ No , this was personal . ”
120801	120829	120795	120795	I	46	“ Eric Landon , Ryan Landon ’s father , invested heavily with my dad and lost everything . Ryan Landon has been gunning for me ever since . ”
120839	120860	120836	120836	her	49	“ So you did n’t want us working on any campaigns for him ? Is that what you ’re saying ? ”
120861	120879	120752	120752	she	49	“ I ’m saying that Ryan Landon asked for Mark as a way to get to you . ”
120880	120885	120836	120836	her	49	“ What ? Why ? ”
120894	120923	120836	120836	her	49	“ He ’s married , for chrissakes . He brought his wife to lunch with us the other day . You ’ve got no reason to be jealous . ”
120924	120935	120936	120936	I	46	“ He would n’t be interested in you that way , ”
120939	120975	120936	120936	I	46	“ It ’s more of a triumph to have you working for him . He wants the satisfaction of knowing he can give an order and you ’ll have to jump to get it done . ”
120976	120981	120752	120752	she	49	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
120982	121060	120936	120936	I	46	“ You do n’t know the whole of it , Eva . How many years he ’s spent trying to undercut me in every way possible . Every business decision he makes is driven by the need to rewrite the connection between the Landon and Cross names . Every success he ’s had has been accompanied by a mention of his father ’s failure to see my dad as a fraud and what that cost the Landons . ”
121061	121069	121070	121070	she	1600	“ Of course I do n’t know , ”
121074	121085	121070	121070	she	1600	“ Because you did n’t see fit to tell me . ”
121086	121093	120936	120936	I	46	“ I ’m telling you now . ”
121094	121102	121103	121103	She	1600	“ When it does n’t matter anymore ! ”
121126	121129	121116	121116	I	46	“ Eva . ”
121147	121153	121138	121138	she	1600	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
121154	121162	121163	121163	I	46	“ Do n’t walk away from me , ”
121166	121181	121163	121163	I	46	“ If we ’re going to fight , let ’s get it over with . ”
121182	121242	121138	121138	she	1600	“ That ’s what you were counting on , right ? You figured you ’d do whatever you wanted , then sweet - talk or fuck your way through it later . But you ca n’t fix this , Gideon . You ca n’t say a few words or screw me brainless and get away with it this time . ”
121243	121263	121163	121163	I	46	“ Fix what ? I saw someone maneuvering to take advantage of you and I took care of it . ”
121264	121272	121273	121273	Her	1600	“ Is that how you see it ? ”
121280	121316	121273	121273	Her	1600	“ I do n’t see it that way at all . Landon is taking the risk . What if Mark and I do a crappy job ? He ’s got a lot riding on PhazeOne . ”
121317	121363	121163	121163	I	46	“ Exactly . He has in - house advertising , marketing , and promotion , just like I do . Why take something he ’s sunk a fortune into — even by my standards — and set himself up for leaks or a massive fail ? ”
121373	121376	121377	121377	I	46	“ Right , ”
121381	121419	121377	121377	I	46	“ You ca n’t answer that because there is no good answer . It ’s an unnecessary gamble . The only people handling the launch of the next - generation GenTen are people whose souls I own . ”
121420	121426	121364	121364	She	1600	“ What are you saying ? ”
121427	121487	121377	121377	I	46	“ That Landon ’s waited a long time for his pound of Cross flesh . Maybe he does n’t care that you married into the name . I do n’t know what he has in mind . At the very least , he ’s forcing us into a place where we ’re unable to share information with each other . ”
121492	121505	121488	121488	Her	1600	“ How is that any different from how our relationship usually works ? ”
121506	121510	121511	121511	I	46	“ Do n’t . ”
121524	121551	121511	121511	I	46	“ Do n’t make this about us when it ’s about him . I ’ll be damned if Landon drags you through hell because of me . ”
121552	121592	121635	121635	She	1600	“ I ’m not saying you ’re wrong ! If you ’d told me about this , I would ’ve made the right decision on my own . Instead , you forced me out of a job I love ! ”
121593	121604	121511	121511	I	46	“ Back up . What decision would that have been ? ”
121605	121611	121612	121612	She	1600	“ I do n’t know . ”
121625	121634	121612	121612	She	1600	“ And now we ’ll never find out . ”
121643	121646	121635	121635	She	1600	“ Stop . ”
121647	121650	121651	121651	she	1600	“ No , ”
121657	121668	121651	121651	she	1600	“ I ’m getting dressed . Then I ’m leaving . ”
121669	121673	121674	121674	I	46	“ Like hell . ”
121681	121703	121651	121651	she	1600	“ I ca n’t be around you right now , Gideon . I do n’t even want to look at you . ”
121719	121727	121704	121704	My	46	“ Mark has n’t taken the job . ”
121745	121762	121728	121728	She	1600	“ He will . I ’m sure you made him an offer he ca n’t refuse . ”
121763	121769	121770	121770	God	46	“ I ’ll withdraw it . ”
121828	121856	121857	121857	She	1600	“ Do n’t bother , Gideon . The damage is done . But you ’ll get a solid employee who ’ll bring a lot to your team . ”
121887	121935	121878	121878	she	1600	“ Listen to me , damn it . They ’re coming after you . Everyone . They want to get at me through you . I ’m doing the best I can , Eva . I ’m trying to protect us the only way I know how . ”
121942	121964	121936	121936	She	1600	“ That ’s a problem . Because this way does n’t work for me . It will never work for me . ”
121965	121973	121936	121936	She	1600	“ Goddamn it , I ’m trying ! ”
121974	122043	121936	121936	She	1600	“ All you had to do was talk to me , Gideon . I was halfway there on my own . Working with you on Crossroads was just the first step . I was going to make the decision to work with you , and you took that away from me . You took it away from both of us . And we ’ll never get it back . ”
122129	122140	122141	122141	I	46	“ Do n’t throw that at me now , angel , ”
122144	122158	122141	122141	I	46	“ Every time I ’ve brought up working together you shut me down . ”
122159	122168	122106	122106	my	46	“ So you just bulldoze right through me ? ”
122169	122208	122141	122141	I	46	“ I was willing to give you time ! I had a plan . I was going to seduce you with the possibilities , let you decide that the best way to develop your potential was alongside me . ”
122209	122224	122106	122106	my	46	“ You should ’ve stuck with the plan . Get out of my way . ”
122230	122286	122225	122225	I	46	“ How could I stick with any plan the last few weeks ? While you ’re feeling righteous , think about what I ’ve dealt with . Brett , the damned tape of you with him , Chris , my brother , therapy , Ireland , my mother , Anne , Corinne , fucking Landon — ”
122292	122346	122287	122287	Eva	49	“ Got ta handle it all yourself , do n’t you ? Am I really your wife , Gideon ? I ’m not even your friend . I bet Angus and Raúl know more about your life than I do . Arash , too . I ’m just the pretty cunt you fuck . ”
122347	122351	122387	122387	Her	1606	“ Shut up . ”
122352	122367	122287	122287	Eva	49	“ You need to get out of my way before this gets any uglier . ”
122368	122386	122387	122387	Her	1606	“ I ca n’t let you leave . You know I ca n’t . Not like this . ”
122391	122414	122387	122387	Her	1606	“ You ’re asking me to give you something I do n’t have right now . I ’m hollowed out , Gideon . ”
122415	122418	122419	122419	I	46	“ Angel … ”
122465	122480	122460	122460	I	46	“ What does it matter if you would ’ve made the same decision anyway ? ”
122481	122488	122489	122489	she	1606	“ You need to stop talking , ”
122493	122521	122489	122489	she	1606	“ Because every word coming out of your mouth makes me think we ’re so far apart on this that we ’ve got no business being married . ”
122580	122587	122588	122588	I	46	“ Tell me what to do , ”
122595	122613	122591	122591	Her	49	“ Let me go for now . Give me some space to think . A few days — ”
122614	122619	122591	122591	Her	49	“ No . No ! ”
122635	122652	122591	122591	Her	49	“ Maybe a few weeks . I need to find a new job , after all . ”
122653	122658	122659	122659	I	46	“ I ca n’t , ”
122683	122694	122675	122675	Eva	49	“ For God ’s sake , something else , Eva ! ”
122695	122706	122707	122707	She	49	“ I have to figure out what to do now . ”
122716	122736	122707	122707	She	49	“ And I ca n’t think when you ’re looking at me like that . I ca n’t think … ”
122803	122806	122807	122807	she	49	“ Crossfire , ”
123022	123025	123026	123026	I	46	“ Angel , ”
123124	123127	123128	123128	she	49	“ Gideon , ”
123429	123432	123433	123433	I	46	“ Eva … ”
123500	123505	123506	123506	she	49	“ That ’s it , ”
123528	123532	123533	123533	I	46	“ Do n’t , ”
123539	123544	123545	123545	she	49	“ You like it , ”
123562	123571	123555	123555	I	46	“ Show me how much you want me . ”
123714	123719	123720	123720	he	1616	“ Keep stroking it , ”
123723	123729	123720	123720	he	1616	“ You ’re almost there . ”
123810	123818	123819	123819	he	1616	“ You think she ’d want you ? ”
123827	123840	123819	123819	he	1616	“ You told her everything . Who ’d want you after that ? ”
123841	123845	123846	123846	I	46	“ Fuck you ! ”
124169	124174	124175	124175	Scott	303	“ YOU’RE here early . ”
124191	124195	124196	124196	I	46	“ Good morning , ”
124382	124394	124395	124395	Scott	303	“ Mark Garrity was waiting by reception when I came in , ”
124398	124411	124395	124395	Scott	303	“ He said you ’d discussed having him come in today … ? ”
124416	124422	124395	124395	Scott	303	“ I ’ll see him . ”
124545	124548	124549	124549	I	46	“ Mark . ”
125075	125081	125082	125082	Arash	0	“ You look like shit , ”
125099	125105	125088	125088	I	46	“ You getting sick again ? ”
125106	125111	125082	125082	Arash	0	“ I ’m fine . ”
125112	125122	125088	125088	I	46	“ My man , you are anything but fine . ”
125251	125254	125255	125256	Dr. Petersen	144	“ Gideon . ”
125282	125289	125278	125278	his	144	“ You do n’t look well . ”
125290	125295	125296	125296	I	46	“ I ’m not , ”
125342	125349	125350	125350	he	144	“ Maybe we should walk again , ”
125353	125362	125350	125350	he	144	“ I could stand to stretch my legs . ”
125363	125367	125368	125368	I	46	“ Call Eva , ”
125371	125384	125368	125368	I	46	“ Tell her to come here . She ’ll listen to you . ”
125390	125398	125385	125385	He	144	“ You ’re having trouble with Eva . ”
125413	125448	125406	125406	I	46	“ She ’s being irrational ! She wo n’t see me … wo n’t talk to me . How the fuck are we supposed to work things out if we ’re not even talking ? ”
125449	125456	125385	125385	He	144	“ That ’s a reasonable question . ”
125457	125501	125406	125406	I	46	“ Damn right ! I ’m a reasonable man . She , however , is out of her damn mind . She ca n’t keep doing this . You have to get her here . You have to make her talk to me . ”
125502	125516	125517	125517	He	46	“ All right . But first I need to understand what ’s happened . ”
125523	125544	125517	125517	He	46	“ I ’m not going to be much use to you if I do n’t know what ’s going on . ”
125552	125567	125545	125545	I	46	“ Do n’t play your head games with me , Doc . Not today . ”
125568	125580	125581	125581	he	46	“ I think I ’m being as reasonable as you are , ”
125585	125604	125581	125581	he	46	“ I want you to work things out with Eva , too . I think you know that . ”
125637	125644	125645	125645	he	46	“ You ’re fighting with Eva , ”
125648	125651	125645	125645	he	46	“ Yes . ”
125652	125663	125679	125679	I	46	“ When ’s the last time you spoke with her ? ”
125668	125671	125664	125664	I	46	“ Sunday . ”
125672	125678	125645	125645	he	46	“ What happened on Sunday ? ”
125745	125752	125753	125753	he	46	“ You cost Eva her job , ”
125757	125786	125753	125753	he	46	“ a job she ’s told us both that she enjoys very much . You can see why she ’d be upset with you , ca n’t you ? ”
125787	125822	125753	125753	he	46	“ Yeah , I get it . But I had valid reasons . Reasons she understands . That ’s what I do n’t get . She understands and she ’s still cutting me off . ”
125823	125847	125753	125753	he	46	“ I ’m not sure I understand why you did n’t discuss this with Eva beforehand . Can you explain that to me ? ”
125865	125873	125874	125874	I	46	“ She would ’ve stewed over it , ”
125877	125911	125874	125874	I	46	“ It would ’ve taken her time to come around . In the meantime , I ’m trying to manage a ton of other shit . We ’re getting hit from all sides . ”
125912	125925	125753	125753	he	46	“ I saw the news about Corinne Giroux ’s book about you . ”
125926	125931	125932	125932	My	46	“ Oh , yeah . ”
125937	125988	125932	125932	My	46	“ She probably got the idea from Six - Ninth ’s ‘ Golden ’ video . Landon got to Eva through a hole in my guard . I could n’t risk giving him another opening while I was distracted with everything else Eva and I are dealing with right now . ”
125993	126038	125989	125990	Dr. Petersen	144	“ You ’re facing a lot of pressure . Do n’t you trust Eva to help you reach the decisions you ’re making ? You have to know that her conflicts with her mother often stem from not being consulted before actions are taken . ”
126039	126044	126045	126045	I	46	“ I know that . ”
126053	126070	126045	126045	I	46	“ But I need to take care of her . After what she ’s lived through … ”
126092	126106	126078	126078	she	1638	“ I have to be strong for her . Make the tough calls . ”
126107	126120	126121	126121	he	46	“ Gideon , you ’re one of the strongest men I know , ”
126134	126145	126125	126125	I	46	“ You have n’t seen me the way she has . ”
126171	126196	126125	126125	I	46	“ Do you think she doubts you because you ’ve let her see you vulnerable ? That does n’t sound like Eva to me . ”
126201	126216	126197	126197	My	46	“ You do n’t know everything . You just … You do n’t know . ”
126217	126237	126238	126238	He	46	“ But Eva does . And she married you anyway . She loves you — very much — anyway . ”
126254	126270	126238	126238	He	46	“ You asked me once if relationships were about compromise . Do you remember that ? ”
126276	126342	126271	126271	I	46	“ That compromise means you do n’t always have to be the strong one , Gideon . You can do the heavy lifting on occasion , and you can let Eva do it sometimes . Marriage is n’t about whether you ’re strong enough as an individual . It ’s about how strong you are together and the luxury of taking turns carrying the load . ”
126343	126346	126347	126347	My	46	“ I … ”
126359	126373	126352	126352	Eva	49	“ I ’m trying . I swear to God , I ’m trying . ”
126374	126380	126271	126271	I	46	“ I know you are . ”
126381	126412	126413	126413	I	46	“ She has to take me back . She has to come back . I need her . She ’s killing me right now . She ’s ripping me apart . ”
126431	126443	126413	126413	I	46	“ What do I do ? Tell me what to do . ”
126444	126506	126422	126422	she	49	“ Eva is going to want to know that you ’re willing to change . She ’ll want to see you taking steps to demonstrate that . You wo n’t face these big decisions too often , so she may adopt a wait - and - see attitude . That will be hard for you , I think . Very hard . ”
126554	126558	126559	126559	I	46	“ I was — ”
126564	126578	126559	126559	I	46	“ The therapist . The one I had when I was a child . ”
126579	126582	126559	126559	I	46	“ Yes ? ”
126583	126600	126559	126559	I	46	“ He … he molested me . For nearly a year . He … raped me . ”
126621	126628	126629	126629	Cary	483	“ Still staring at that text ? ”
126648	126654	126629	126629	Cary	483	“ I ca n’t sleep . ”
126772	126785	126840	126840	he	1645	“ When are you going to talk to him , baby girl ? ”
126786	126792	126793	126793	I	46	“ Soon . I just … ”
126807	126817	126793	126793	I	46	“ I think we both need a little time . ”
127030	127039	127040	127040	Cary	483	“ You ’re running him through the wringer , ”
127046	127055	127056	127056	Gideon	339	“ He ’s done it , not me . ”
127126	127133	127134	127134	He	623	“ Thanks for sticking with me . ”
127137	127162	127134	127134	He	623	“ I like Stanton . It ’s no hardship hanging at his place a few days . We are eventually going home , right ? ”
127163	127170	127134	127134	He	623	“ I ca n’t hide forever . ”
127171	127178	127179	127179	he	623	“ So you ’ve always said , ”
127182	127201	127179	127179	he	623	“ Personally , I like hiding . Just taking a fucking break and forgetting about all the crap . ”
127202	127214	127134	127134	He	623	“ But the crap ’s always out there waiting for you . ”
127239	127244	127245	127245	he	623	“ Let it wait , ”
127352	127364	127365	127365	I	46	“ Mark asked me to move to Cross Industries with him , ”
127377	127385	127365	127365	I	46	“ Well , you saw that coming . ”
127386	127401	127402	127402	I	46	“ I guess , but it was still surreal when he brought it up . ”
127405	127476	127402	127402	I	46	“ He ’s so excited , Cary . He ’s getting a hefty raise , and that will change a lot of things for him and Steven . They ’ll be able to afford a really fancy wedding plus a long honeymoon , and they ’re looking for a condominium now . It ’s hard to hold on to my resentment when this is such a good thing for him . ”
127477	127486	127365	127365	I	46	“ Are you going to work for Gideon ? ”
127487	127526	127402	127402	I	46	“ I do n’t know . I was n’t kidding when I told him I was halfway toward making that decision on my own . But now … I kinda want to apply elsewhere just to spite him . ”
127534	127545	127527	127527	Cary	483	“ Show him he ’s not the boss of you . ”
127546	127549	127550	127550	I	46	“ Yeah . ”
127566	127621	127550	127550	I	46	“ But that ’s stupid . I ’d never know if I got hired for me or for his name , whether that turned out to be a good or a bad thing . Anyway , I ’ve got a month before Mark moves on . I ’ve got time to think about it . ”
127622	127637	127527	127527	Cary	483	“ Maybe Waters Field and Leaman will keep you . Have you considered that ? ”
127638	127688	127550	127550	I	46	“ It ’s a possibility . I ’m not sure how I would respond . It would save me a job search , but I would n’t have Mark , and he ’s the reason I love my job . Would I still want to be there without him ? ”
127689	127698	127527	127527	Cary	483	“ You ’d still have Megumi and Will . ”
127699	127704	127705	127705	I	46	“ There ’s that , ”
127722	127745	127719	127719	he	46	“ So it looks like you and me are just floating around in the hell - if - I - know boat . ”
127746	127753	127754	127754	I	46	“ Trey is going to call , ”
127773	127789	127790	127790	Cary	483	“ Sure . He ’s a nice guy . He wo n’t leave me hanging . ”
127795	127813	127790	127790	Cary	483	“ It ’s what he ’s going to say , not when , that ’s the kicker . ”
127814	127825	127826	127826	I	46	“ I know . Love should be easier than this , ”
127829	127845	127790	127790	Cary	483	“ If this were a romantic comedy , it ’d be called Love Actually Sucks . ”
127846	127858	127790	127790	Cary	483	“ Maybe we should ’ve stuck with Sex and the City . ”
127859	127893	127790	127790	Cary	483	“ Tried that . Ended up Knocked Up . I should ’ve gone for being a 40 - Year - Old Virgin , but I had way too much of a head start . ”
127894	127910	127790	127790	Cary	483	“ We can write a manual on How to Lose a Guy in 10 Weeks . ”
127916	127920	127911	127911	Cary	483	“ Fucking perfect . ”
128075	128081	128082	128082	I	46	“ Good morning , Angus . ”
128092	128098	128082	128082	I	46	“ Is he in there ? ”
128115	128122	128099	128099	He	46	“ Good morning , Mrs. Cross . ”
128163	128168	128160	128160	I	46	“ How is he ? ”
128169	128177	128178	128178	He	46	“ Worse than you , I expect . ”
128190	128203	128178	128178	He	46	“ He ’s suffering , lass . Last night was the hardest . ”
128204	128207	128208	128208	I	46	“ God . ”
128378	128381	128382	128382	My	46	“ Eva ? ”
128427	128437	128438	128438	he	46	“ It ’s okay if you do n’t talk , ”
128442	128446	128447	128447	He	46	“ I just … ”
128453	128486	128447	128447	He	46	“ I ’m sorry , Eva . I want you to know I ’m sorry and that I ’ll do whatever you need me to . I just want to fix this . ”
128487	128490	128493	128493	him	46	“ Gideon … ”
128505	128544	128493	128493	him	46	“ I believe that you ’re sorry we ’re not together now . But I also believe that you would do something like this again . I ’m trying to figure out if I can live with that . ”
128553	128559	128560	128560	he	46	“ What does that mean ? ”
128564	128571	128560	128560	he	46	“ What would be the alternative ? ”
128580	128671	128572	128572	I	46	“ I do n’t have any answers . That ’s why I ’ve stayed away . I want to give you everything , Gideon . I never want to say no to you , it ’s so hard for me . But right now , I ’m afraid that if I make this compromise , if I stay with you knowing how you are and that you ’re not going to change , I ’m just going to resent you and , eventually , fall out of love with you . ”
128672	128682	128683	128683	His	46	“ Eva … Christ . Do n’t say that ! ”
128687	128696	128683	128683	His	46	“ I told Dr. Petersen . About Hugh . ”
128697	128700	128701	128701	My	46	“ What ? ”
128706	128709	128701	128701	My	46	“ When ? ”
128710	128738	128739	128739	He	46	“ Last night . I told him everything . About Hugh . Anne . He ’s going to help me , Eva . He said some things … ”
128742	128759	128739	128739	He	46	“ They made sense to me . About me and the way I am with you . ”
128760	128765	128766	128766	I	46	“ Oh , Gideon . ”
128786	128801	128778	128778	I	46	“ I ’m very proud of you . I know it was n’t easy . ”
128802	128881	128882	128882	He	1664	“ You have to stick with me . You promised . I told you I was going to fuck this up . I ’ll fuck up again . I do n’t know what the hell I ’m doing , but God … I love you . I love you so fucking much . I ca n’t do this without you . I ca n’t live without you . You ’re breaking me , Eva . I ca n’t … ”
128890	128895	128882	128882	He	1664	“ I need you . ”
128896	128902	128903	128903	Tears	183	“ Ah God , Gideon . ”
128923	128934	128903	128903	Tears	183	“ I do n’t know what to do , either . ”
128935	128953	128882	128882	He	1664	“ Ca n’t we figure it out together ? Are n’t we better — stronger — together ? ”
128969	129015	128954	128954	I	46	“ I want us to be . I want that more than anything . I just do n’t know if we can get there . There has n’t been a single time when you ’ve let me figure things out with you . Not once . ”
129016	129035	128954	128954	I	46	“ If I did … if I do — and I will — you’ll come back to me ? ”
129036	129051	129052	129052	I	46	“ I have n’t left you , Gideon . I do n’t know how . ”
129080	129098	129075	129076	the man	483	“ But yes , if we could really be a team , nothing could keep me away . ”
129099	129108	129134	129134	He	483	“ HEARD you guys landed the PhazeOne campaign . ”
129126	129133	129116	129116	I	46	“ I have n’t heard that . ”
129204	129214	129215	129215	he	483	“ That ’s the buzz I ’ve been hearing , ”
129218	129221	129222	129222	I	46	“ Man . ”
129228	129237	129222	129222	I	46	“ I am always the last to know . ”
129324	129335	129336	129336	Will	126	“ Mark ’s going to kill me for telling you . ”
129341	129352	129336	129336	Will	126	“ I wanted to be the first to congratulate you . ”
129353	129361	129405	129405	I	46	“ Okay . Thank you . Maybe . ”
129362	129389	129390	129390	He	126	“ I ’m dying to get my hands on that system , you know . The tech blogs are wild with rumors about PhazeOne ’s features . ”
129412	129423	129405	129405	I	46	“ You wo n’t be hearing any leaks from me . ”
129424	129435	129436	129436	He	126	“ Damn it . A guy ’s got ta hope . ”
129439	129461	129436	129436	He	126	“ They ’re probably going to lock you in solitary somewhere until the release just to keep a lid on it . ”
129462	129480	129405	129405	I	46	“ Makes you wonder why LanCorp would take it to an outside agency , does n’t it ? ”
129484	129496	129481	129481	He	126	“ Yeah . I guess . Had n’t thought about it . ”
129515	129525	129504	129504	I	46	“ There ’s a new GenTen coming out soon . ”
129526	129546	129504	129504	I	46	“ I heard . That ’s a no - brainer , though . Everyone ’s going to buy it . ”
129569	129576	129577	129577	he	126	“ You got plans for lunch ? ”
129589	129602	129580	129580	I	46	“ Yes , I ’m going out with Mark and his partner . ”
129603	129608	129609	129609	He	126	“ Oh , right . ”
129622	129656	129609	129609	He	126	“ Maybe we could grab drinks after work sometime this week . Drag our significant others with us . If Gideon ’s up for it . I know he ’s a busy guy . ”
129721	129726	129727	129727	I	46	“ Sounds like fun , ”
129737	129753	129727	129727	I	46	“ I ’ll talk to him about it . See what we can work out . ”
129757	129763	129754	129754	Will	126	“ Cool . Lemme know . ”
129764	129770	129754	129754	Will	126	“ I’VE got a problem . ”
129771	129774	129775	129775	I	46	“ Oh ? ”
129854	129860	129848	129848	I	46	“ Let ’s fix it . ”
129864	129874	129861	129861	Steven	328	“ Eva ’s right . Lay it on us . ”
129888	129904	129875	129875	Mark	757	“ So Mr. Waters told me this morning to start working on the LanCorp brief . ”
129905	129908	129909	129909	I	46	“ Yay ! ”
129912	129960	129875	129875	Mark	757	“ Not so fast . In light of that , I had to give him my notice . I ’d been hoping to wait until Friday , but they need someone who can stick with the client all the way through , not just the first month . ”
129961	129968	129969	129969	I	46	“ You ’ve got a point , ”
129976	129983	129969	129969	I	46	“ What a bummer , though . ”
129984	129990	129991	129991	He	757	“ It sucked , but … ”
129994	130049	129991	129991	He	757	“ It is what it is . Then he called in the other partners . They told me that the LanCorp brass was insistent that I head the campaign when they first approached the agency , enough so that the partners are worried they ’ll lose the account if I ’m not managing it . ”
130059	130068	130050	130050	Steven	328	“ That ’s what we like to hear ! ”
130075	130102	130069	130069	Mark	757	“ Yeah , it was a boost , for sure . So anyway , they offered me a promotion and a raise if I ’ll stay . ”
130103	130106	130107	130107	I	46	“ Whoa . ”
130111	130118	130107	130107	I	46	“ That ’s a serious boost . ”
130119	130143	130069	130069	Mark	757	“ They ca n’t offer what Cross did . Not even half , but let ’s be honest , he ’s overpaying me . ”
130144	130148	130149	130149	Steven	328	“ Says you , ”
130152	130159	130149	130149	Steven	328	“ You ’re worth every penny . ”
130180	130186	130165	130165	I	46	“ I agree with that . ”
130187	130201	130202	130202	Mark	757	“ But I feel like I owe Waters Field and Leaman some loyalty . ”
130208	130232	130202	130202	Mark	757	“ They ’ve been good to me and they want to keep me , even knowing I can be poached by someone else . ”
130233	130243	130244	130244	Steven	328	“ You ’ve given them good work for years , ”
130247	130264	130244	130244	Steven	328	“ They got a lot out of you . You do n’t owe them any favors . ”
130265	130307	130202	130202	Mark	757	“ I know that . And I was fine with leaving an empty office behind , because they could fill that quick enough . But I ’m having a hard time with possibly costing them the LanCorp campaign when I go . ”
130308	130318	130319	130319	I	46	“ But that decision is n’t yours to make , ”
130323	130338	130319	130319	I	46	“ If LanCorp does n’t retain the agency , that ’s up to them . ”
130339	130362	130202	130202	Mark	757	“ I ’ve tried spinning it that way , too . But it ’s still not something I want to see happen . ”
130377	130384	130372	130372	I	46	“ Can you do the honors ? ”
130385	130388	130389	130389	He	328	“ Sure . ”
130442	130452	130437	130437	I	46	“ I ca n’t work on the PhazeOne campaign . ”
130460	130472	130473	130473	I	46	“ Look , the Landons and the Crosses go way back , ”
130476	130507	130473	130473	I	46	“ and there ’s bad blood between them . Gideon ’s got some concerns , and I see his point . It ’s strong enough for me to be cautious . ”
130511	130527	130508	130508	Mark	757	“ Landon knows who you are . He does n’t have a problem with it . ”
130528	130565	130508	130508	Mark	757	“ I know . But the PhazeOne system is a pretty big deal . There ’s risk involved with having access to it , and I do n’t need to contribute to that in any way . ”
130606	130611	130599	130599	Steven	328	“ You ’re serious . ”
130612	130640	130599	130599	Steven	328	“ Afraid so . Not that your decision is in any way affected by me , Mark , but I thought I should put that out there . ”
130641	130649	130650	130650	Mark	757	“ I ’m not sure I understand , ”
130653	130677	130678	130678	Steven	328	“ She ’s telling you that if you stay with your job , you ’ll be losing both the money and your assistant , ”
130681	130705	130678	130678	Steven	328	“ Or you can move to Cross Industries as you ’ve already agreed to do , get the money , and keep Eva . ”
130706	130709	130710	130710	God	46	“ Well … ”
130765	130781	130759	130759	I	46	“ I ca n’t say yet that I ’ll be making the move with you . ”
130791	130798	130782	130782	Mark	757	“ This just keeps getting worse . ”
130799	130810	130811	130811	I	46	“ I ’m not saying definitively that I wo n’t . ”
130822	130858	130811	130811	I	46	“ I ’m just not sure that Gideon and I should be working together . I mean I ’m not sure he should be my boss … or whatever . You know what I mean . ”
130859	130866	130867	130867	Steven	328	“ I hate to say it , ”
130870	130878	130867	130867	Steven	328	“ but she ’s got a point . ”
130879	130887	130888	130888	Mark	757	“ This is not helping my problem , ”
130891	130896	130897	130897	I	46	“ I ’m sorry . ”
130929	130935	130936	130936	I	46	“ On the bright side , ”
130940	130948	130936	130936	I	46	“ you ’re definitely a hot commodity . ”
130956	130962	130949	130949	Steven	328	“ I knew that already . ”
130963	130964	130966	130966	his	328	“ So”—Cary
130975	130980	130971	130971	I	46	side—“here we are again . ”
131141	131148	131149	131149	I	46	“ We ’ll go home tomorrow , ”
131273	131280	131281	131281	I	46	“ Have you heard from Trey ? ”
131313	131333	131342	131342	His	483	“ He sent me a text saying he was thinking about me but was n’t ready to talk yet . ”
131334	131341	131342	131342	His	483	“ Well , that ’s something . ”
131351	131355	131342	131342	His	483	“ Is it ? ”
131356	131359	131360	131360	I	46	“ Yes , ”
131363	131394	131360	131360	I	46	“ I ’m in the same place with Gideon . I think about him all the time , but I do n’t have anything to say to him right now . ”
131395	131420	131342	131342	His	483	“ So what ’s next ? Where do you go from here ? When do you decide you ’ve got something more to say ? ”
131445	131453	131430	131431	Harrison Ford	249	“ When something changes , I guess . ”
131454	131468	131342	131342	His	483	“ When he changes , you mean . What if he does n’t ? ”
131500	131565	131493	131493	I	46	“ I know you want to put the baby first and that ’s the right thing to do . But Tatiana ’s not happy . And you ’re not , either . Trey ’s definitely not . This is n’t working out for any of you . Have you thought about being with Trey and the two of you helping Tatiana with the baby ? ”
131569	131592	131566	131566	He	483	“ She ’s not gon na go for that . If she ’s miserable , everyone else has to be , too . ”
131593	131630	131631	131631	I	46	“ I do n’t think that should be her choice to make . She ’s as responsible for getting pregnant as you are . You do n’t have to do some sort of penance , Cary . ”
131658	131693	131631	131631	I	46	“ Be happy with Trey . Make him happy . And if Tatiana ca n’t be happy with having two hot guys looking after her , then she ’s … not doing something right . ”
131708	131716	131694	131694	Cary	483	“ Solve your own problem that easily . ”
131717	131723	131724	131724	I	46	“ I wish I could . ”
131850	131853	131854	131854	he	1693	“ Angel , ”
131865	131870	131854	131854	he	1693	“ Is everything okay ? ”
131871	131876	131877	131877	He	1693	“ Yes . No . ”
131883	131889	131877	131877	He	1693	“ I had a nightmare . ”
131890	131893	131894	131894	I	46	“ Oh . ”
131931	131936	131919	131919	they	1695	“ I ’m sorry . ”
131968	131977	131978	131978	he	1693	“ I ’m having them a lot lately , ”
131982	131989	131978	131978	he	1693	“ Every time I fall asleep . ”
132021	132036	131990	131990	My	46	“ You ’re stressed , Gideon . I ’m not sleeping well , either . ”
132047	132052	131990	131990	My	46	“ I miss you . ”
132053	132056	131990	131990	My	46	“ Eva … ”
132057	132060	132061	132061	I	46	“ Sorry . ”
132067	132075	132061	132061	I	46	“ Maybe I should n’t say that . ”
132108	132149	132188	132188	I	46	“ No , I need to hear it . I ’m scared , Eva . I ’ve never felt fear like this . I ’m afraid you wo n’t come back … that you wo n’t give me another chance . ”
132150	132153	132188	132188	I	46	“ Gideon — ”
132154	132187	132188	132188	I	46	“ I dreamed about my father at first . We were walking on the beach and he was holding my hand . I ’ve been dreaming about the beach a lot lately . ”
132196	132202	132188	132188	I	46	“ Maybe that means something . ”
132203	132269	132188	132188	I	46	“ Maybe . I was little in the dream . I had to look up a long way to see my dad ’s face . He was smiling , but then I always remember him smiling . Even though I heard him fighting with my mom a lot toward the end , I ca n’t remember any other expression on his face but a smile . ”
132270	132292	132188	132188	I	46	“ I ’m sure you made him happy . And proud . He probably always smiled when he looked at you . ”
132313	132328	132309	132309	he	1697	“ I saw you up ahead on the beach , walking away from us . ”
132338	132394	132329	132329	I	46	“ Your hair was blowing in the breeze and the sun lit it up . I thought it was beautiful . I pointed you out to my dad . I wanted you to turn your head so we could see your face . I knew you were gorgeous . I wanted him to see you . ”
132408	132438	132395	132395	Tears	183	“ I tried to run after you . I was pulling at his hand and he was holding me back , laughing about chasing pretty girls at my age . ”
132551	132561	132562	132562	he	623	“ I was tugging so hard on his hand , ”
132565	132626	132562	132562	he	623	“ digging my bare feet into the sand for traction . But he was so much stronger than me . You were walking farther and farther away . He laughed again . Only this time , it was n’t his laugh . It was Hugh ’s . And when I looked up again , it was n’t my father anymore . ”
132627	132632	132633	132633	I	46	“ Oh , Gideon . ”
132659	132693	132562	132562	he	623	“ He told me you did n’t want me , that you were going away because you knew everything and it made you sick . That you could n’t get away fast enough . ”
132694	132700	132701	132701	I	46	“ That ’s not true ! ”
132707	132738	132701	132701	I	46	“ You know that ’s not true . I love you . It ’s because I love you so much that I ’m thinking so hard about this . Us . ”
132739	132796	132562	132562	he	623	“ I ’m trying to give you space . But I feel like it would be so easy for us to drift apart . A day goes by , then another . You ’ll find a new routine without me in it … Christ , Eva , I do n’t want you to get over me . ”
132811	132882	132797	132797	I	46	“ There ’s a way to get through this , Gideon , I know there is . But when I ’m with you I lose myself in you . I just want to be with you and to be happy , so I let things ride and put them off . We make love and I think we ’ll be okay , because we have that and it ’s perfect . ”
132883	132892	132943	132943	He	1702	“ It is perfect . It ’s everything . ”
132893	132942	132797	132797	I	46	“ When you ’re inside me , looking at me , I feel like we can conquer anything . But we ’ve really got to work on this ! We ca n’t be afraid to deal with our baggage because we do n’t want to lose each other . ”
132947	132964	132943	132943	He	1702	“ I just want us to spend time together not dealing with all this other shit ! ”
132965	132969	132970	132970	I	46	“ I know . ”
132979	133005	132970	132970	I	46	“ But we have to earn it , I think . We ca n’t manufacture it by running away for a weekend or a week . ”
133006	133013	132943	132943	He	1702	“ How do we earn it ? ”
133024	133047	133014	133014	I	46	“ Tonight was good . You calling me , telling me about your dream . It ’s a good step , Gideon . ”
133048	133096	132943	132943	He	1702	“ We ’ll keep making steps , then . We have to keep moving together or we ’re going to end up moving apart . Do n’t let that happen ! I ’m fighting here , with everything I ’ve got . Fight for me , too . ”
133137	133159	133126	133126	I	46	“ I ’m going to that all - night café on Broadway and Eighty - fifth for coffee and a croissant . ”
133168	133173	133160	133160	He	1703	“ What ? Now ? ”
133174	133178	133179	133179	I	46	“ Right now . ”
133198	133201	133194	133194	he	1703	“ Okay . ”
133778	133786	133787	133787	he	623	“ I ’m going to kiss you , ”
133940	133947	133948	133948	he	623	“ You ’ll make me come , ”
133963	133969	133948	133948	he	623	“ I ’m right there . ”
133970	133976	133998	133998	I	46	“ I do n’t care . ”
133986	133997	133977	133977	His	623	“ The next time I come will be inside you . ”
134038	134041	134024	134024	we	1718	“ Gideon … ”
134047	134060	134042	134042	His	623	“ Guess we ’ll settle for coffee and a croissant for now . ”
134089	134092	134093	134093	he	623	“ God , ”
134108	134117	134093	134093	he	623	“ I ’ve missed you so damn much . ”
134216	134223	134224	134224	I	46	“ I ’m not even hungry , ”
134228	134235	134236	134236	he	623	“ Not for food , anyway , ”
134351	134407	134344	134344	Gideon	339	“ I ’m not surprised . An account like that should be handled by one of the partners . Mark ’s good , but he ’s a junior manager . LanCorp would ’ve had to push to get him . And you . The request is unusual enough to give the partners cause for concern . ”
134414	134421	134408	134408	I	46	“ You did the same thing . ”
134422	134428	134471	134471	Gideon	339	“ I did , yes . ”
134429	134441	134442	134442	I	46	“ I do n’t know what he ’s going to do . ”
134449	134470	134442	134442	I	46	“ But I told him I could n’t work on the PhazeOne campaign even if he stayed to manage it . ”
134478	134490	134491	134491	I	46	“ You have good reasons for doing the things you do , ”
134495	134504	134491	134491	I	46	“ even if I do n’t like them . ”
134513	134526	134505	134505	He	46	“ Will you come with him to Cross Industries if he moves ? ”
134527	134559	134505	134505	He	46	“ I ’m not sure yet . I ’m feeling pretty resentful right now . Unless that changes , it would n’t be a healthy working relationship for either of us . ”
134563	134567	134560	134560	He	46	“ Fair enough . ”
134631	134646	134626	134626	He	46	“ Tonight — after Dr. Petersen — could I take you out to dinner ? ”
134647	134650	134651	134651	I	46	“ Yes . ”
134664	134670	134651	134651	I	46	“ I ’d like that . ”
134693	134712	134671	134671	I	46	“ Will asked if we ’d be up for grabbing a drink with him and Natalie this week . ”
134723	134731	134719	134719	Gideon	339	“ I think that ’d be great . ”
134818	134826	134827	134827	I	46	“ I ’m still mad at you , ”
134831	134835	134827	134827	I	46	“ I know . ”
134836	134846	134827	134827	I	46	“ And I ’m still in love with you . ”
134847	134851	134852	134852	His	46	“ Thank God . ”
134862	134877	134852	134852	His	46	“ We ’ll figure out the rest . We ’ll get back on track . ”
