3230	3296	3191	3191	Stanton	698	“ There are rewards for milestones such as anniversaries and the birth of children , and nothing in the way of penalties for Eva , aside from marital counseling . A dissolution would have a more than equitable distribution of assets . I was tempted to ask if Cross had his in - house counsel review it . I imagine they argued strenuously against it . ”
3316	3334	3308	3308	she	345	“ But you knew they were eloping ? You knew , and you did n’t say anything ? ”

4883	4893	4876	4876	I	0	“ It ’s asking a lot , I know . ”
4900	4934	4894	4894	He	315	“ I hate to lose you , Eva , you know that . I ’m not sure I ’ve ever really expressed how much you ’ve contributed . You make me work better . ”
4935	4945	4894	4894	He	315	“ Thank you , Mark . I appreciate that . ”
5163	5173	5174	5174	Mark	116	“ So , where are you going from here ? ”
5177	5195	5174	5174	Mark	116	“ Honestly … I ’m still figuring that out . I just know I ca n’t stay . ”
5326	5333	5334	5334	Mark	116	“ Because of the LanCorp account ? ”
5337	5341	5342	5342	I	0	“ In part . ”

6192	6262	6263	6263	My	0	“ Dad — You’re freaking me out . We were on this island and it was beautiful , so beautiful . The resort we were staying at does weddings all the time , they make it easy … like Las Vegas . There ’s a full - time officiant and someone who handles the licenses . It was just a perfect moment , you know . The perfect opportunity . ”
6267	6274	6263	6263	My	0	“ Dad … please say something . ”
6275	6286	6263	6263	My	0	“ I … I do n’t know what to say . ”

6371	6381	6382	6382	He	348	“ That ’s what I was expecting , Eva . ”
6385	6455	6382	6382	He	348	“ Damn it . I feel like Cross just stole something from me ! I ’m supposed to give you away , I was working up to that , and he just runs off and takes you ? And you did n’t tell me ? You were here , in my house , and you did n’t say anything to me ? It hurts , Eva . It hurts . ”

6780	6785	6777	6777	I	0	“ I ’m okay . ”
6824	6870	6807	6807	Gideon	418	“ You ’ve got a right to be angry , and hurt , I ’ll give you that . But I wo n’t have my wife twisted up over this . … No , obviously without children of my own , I ca n’t imagine . ”
6905	6936	6894	6894	Gideon	418	“ No , I would n’t be happy about it if my sister eloped . That said , she ’s not the one I ’d take it out on . … ”
6960	7014	7023	7023	Gideon	418	“ I ’m available anytime , Victor . I ’ll even come to you , if that ’s what you need . When I married your daughter , I accepted full responsibility for both her and her happiness . If there are consequences to be faced , I have no problem facing them . ”
7051	7054	7043	7044	My dad	348	“ Eva ? ”
7072	7081	7066	7066	Gideon	418	“ Yeah , I ’m here , Dad . ”
7082	7085	7086	7086	He	348	“ Sweetheart … ”
7094	7145	7086	7086	He	348	“ Do n’t be upset , okay ? I ’m just … I need to let this sink in . I was n’t expecting this and … I ’ve got to put it together in my head . Can we talk later tonight ? When I get off my shift ? ”
7146	7152	7184	7184	his	418	“ Yes , of course . ”

7491	7494	7495	7495	His	418	“ Ah . ”
7505	7513	7495	7495	His	418	“ But that would n’t cover this . ”
7960	7963	7957	7958	baby girl	436	“ Eva ! ”
8107	8110	8090	8090	She	698	“ Mom . ”
8111	8116	8120	8120	she	698	“ Are you okay ? ”
8125	8132	8090	8090	She	698	“ What ? Yes . Why ? ”
8133	8138	8090	8090	She	698	“ Your father called . ”
8139	8142	8143	8143	I	0	“ Oh . ”
8149	8158	8143	8143	I	0	“ He did n’t take the news well . ”
8159	8166	8168	8168	she	698	“ No , he did n’t . ”
8179	8197	8168	8168	she	698	“ But he ’s dealing with it . He was n’t quite ready to let you go . ”
8198	8206	8208	8209	my father	348	“ Because I remind him of you . ”
8233	8250	8266	8266	She	331	“ Nonsense , Eva . There ’s a resemblance , but you ’re much more interesting . ”
8258	8265	8256	8256	me	0	“ Gideon says I ’m interesting . ”
8281	8311	8266	8266	She	331	“ Of course . He ’s a connoisseur of women . As gorgeous as you are , it would take more than beauty to get him to marry you . ”
8503	8508	8509	8509	I	0	“ Hey , you , ”
8524	8534	8509	8509	I	0	“ Eva . It ’s good to see you . ”
8535	8545	8546	8546	He	110	“ I was just thinking the same about you . ”
8602	8636	8590	8590	she	345	“ Do n’t worry about your father . He ’s got that quick Latin temper , but it never lasts long . All he really wants is to make sure you ’re happy . ”
8643	8660	8637	8637	I	0	“ I know . But I really , really want Dad and Gideon to get along . ”
8661	8678	8679	8679	She	345	“ They ’re two very headstrong men , honey . They ’re going to clash occasionally . ”
8736	8741	8742	8742	I	0	“ You ’re right , ”
8745	8758	8742	8742	I	0	“ They ’re both big boys . They ’ll figure it out . ”
8761	8767	8742	8742	I	0	“ Of course they will . ”
8778	8792	8772	8772	I	0	“ I think I ’ve come up with a solution for Corinne Giroux . ”
8798	8831	8772	8772	I	0	“ Eva , you have got to put that woman out of your mind . By giving her any thought at all , you ’re giving her power she does n’t deserve . ”
8832	8845	8846	8846	I	0	“ We allowed her to become a problem by being so secretive . ”
8853	8918	8846	8846	I	0	“ The world has a tremendous appetite for all things Gideon . He ’s gorgeous , rich , sexy , and brilliant . People want to know everything about him , but he ’s guarded his privacy to such an extreme degree that they know next to nothing . That ’s given Corinne this opening to write her biography about her time with Gideon . ”
8926	8932	8919	8919	She	331	“ What are you thinking ? ”
8945	8952	8938	8938	I	0	“ We need more of this . ”
9049	9058	9059	9059	I	0	“ Gideon and I need to stop hiding , ”
9062	9127	9059	9059	I	0	“ We need to be seen . We spend too much time shut in . The public wants the billionaire playboy who ’s finally becoming Prince Charming . They want fairy tales , Mom , and happy endings . I need to give people the story they want and by doing so , I ’m going to make Corinne and her book look pathetic . ”
9135	9142	9128	9129	My mother	331	“ That ’s a horrible idea . ”

9151	9197	9128	9129	My mother	331	“ It ’s terrible , Eva ! You do n’t trade hard - earned privacy for anything . If you feed that public hunger , it will just get larger . For God ’s sake , you do n’t want to become a tabloid fixture ! ”
9202	9211	9198	9198	My	0	“ It wo n’t play out that way . ”
9212	9219	9220	9220	Her	331	“ Why would you risk it ? ”
9227	9260	9220	9220	Her	331	“ Because of Corinne Giroux ? Her book will come and go in the blink of an eye , but you ’ll never get rid of the attention once you invite it ! ”
9261	9294	9198	9198	My	0	“ I do n’t get you . There ’s no way to be married to Gideon and not get attention ! I might as well take control and set the stage myself . ”
9295	9309	9220	9220	Her	331	“ There ’s a difference between being prominent and being a TMZ headline ! ”
9314	9326	9310	9310	I	0	“ I think you ’re taking the drama to the extreme . ”
9332	9364	9327	9327	She	331	“ I ’m telling you , this is the wrong way to handle the situation . Have you discussed this with Gideon ? I ca n’t see him agreeing to this . ”
9413	9416	9417	9417	I	0	“ Mom . ”
9432	9443	9417	9417	I	0	“ We do n’t have to worry about Nathan anymore . ”
9449	9452	9453	9453	she	331	“ No , ”
9462	9489	9453	9453	she	331	“ But having everything you ’ve done … everything you ’ve said or decided dissected for the entertainment of the world could be its own nightmare . ”
9490	9512	9513	9513	I	0	“ I ’m not going to allow other people in the world to dictate how I and my marriage are perceived ! ”
9535	9542	9453	9453	she	331	“ Eva , you ’re not — ”
9543	9564	9565	9565	I	0	“ Either give me an alternative that does n’t involve sitting around doing nothing or drop the subject , Mom . ”
9571	9594	9565	9565	I	0	“ We ’re not going to agree and I ’m not changing my mind without a different game plan on the table . ”
9655	9659	9660	9661	ARASH MADANI	116	“ MORE FLOWERS ? ”
9772	9784	9760	9760	Arash	116	“ What ’s the secret to getting sent some of these ? ”

9858	9872	9877	9877	he	116	“ I prefer to gloat quietly . Do you have something for me ? ”

9948	9973	9935	9935	His	116	“ We ’ve ironed out the bigger points . Still finessing some clauses , but we should be ready to proceed by next week . ”
9974	9977	10030	10030	Arash	116	“ Good . ”
9978	9987	9990	9990	he	116	“ You are a man of few words . ”

10008	10029	10003	10003	I	0	“ Eva may want to go out . If so , I ’ll try to talk her out of it . ”
10033	10065	10003	10003	I	0	“ I got ta tell you , I expected you to settle down at some point — we all do , eventually — but I thought I ’d have some warning . ”
10066	10070	10030	10030	Arash	116	“ So did I. ”
10271	10284	10285	10285	Arash	116	“ You showed no sign at all you were leaning that way , ”
10290	10323	10285	10285	Arash	116	“ If I remember correctly , you tagged two women when we blew out Cinco de Mayo , and a few weeks later you ’re telling me to draft an insane prenup . ”
10355	10367	10324	10324	I	0	“ When have you known me to delay sealing a deal ? ”
10368	10385	10386	10386	He	116	“ It ’s one thing to expand your portfolio , another to reboot your life overnight . ”
10389	10405	10386	10386	He	116	“ So what are your plans , then ? Breaking in the new beach house ? ”
10406	10411	10413	10414	my wife	2357	“ An excellent idea . ”
10512	10548	10505	10505	his	514	“ Corinne Giroux ’s at reception . She says she needs just a few minutes to drop off something for you . Because it ’s private , she wants to give it to you personally . ”
10549	10555	10556	10556	Arash	116	“ Of course she does , ”
10560	10567	10556	10556	Arash	116	“ Maybe it ’s more flowers . ”
10574	10578	10568	10568	I	0	“ Wrong woman . ”

10590	10608	10568	10568	I	0	“ Keep thinking that while you head up to reception to get whatever it is she has . ”
10614	10619	10609	10609	His	514	“ Really ? Ouch . ”
10620	10633	10505	10505	his	514	“ She wants to talk , she can talk to my attorney . ”
10643	10649	10634	10634	He	514	“ Got it , boss . ”
10660	10679	10650	10650	I	0	“ I ’m sure you heard that , Scott , but to be clear , Madani will handle . ”
10680	10686	10650	10650	I	0	“ Yes , Mr. Cross . ”
10983	10998	10960	10960	She	984	“ Gideon . Surely you can spare a few minutes for an old friend ? ”
11010	11026	11005	11005	I	0	“ And extend the courtesy of not calling security . Make it quick , Corinne . ”
11064	11069	11070	11070	I	0	“ What is this ? ”
11078	11090	11054	11054	she	984	“ These are the photos that will appear in the book . ”
11392	11401	11381	11381	I	0	“ Eva and I were married last month . ”
11677	11708	11816	11816	Scott	514	“ What do you expect these photos to prove , Corinne ? We dated . We ended . You married , and now I have . There ’s nothing left . ”
11709	11725	11653	11653	I	0	“ Then why are you getting so upset ? You ’re not indifferent , Gideon . ”
11726	11775	11776	11776	I	0	“ No , I ’m irritated . These only make me appreciate what I have with Eva more . And knowing that they ’ll hurt her sure as hell does n’t make me feel sentimental about the past . This is our final good - bye , Corinne . ”
11788	11802	11776	11776	I	0	“ If you come back here , security wo n’t let you through . ”

12304	12322	12291	12291	Aggravated	117	“ If I have any interest in seeing them , I can always flip through your book . ”
12327	12336	12323	12323	Her	2431	“ Good - bye , Eva . Gideon . ”

13473	13515	13465	13465	Eva	2431	“ She said you would n’t like the idea , but you ’ve used the paparazzi before , when you dipped me on the sidewalk and kissed me until I could n’t think straight . You wanted that picture out there . ”
13516	13542	13465	13465	Eva	2431	“ Yes , but the opportunity presented itself , I did n’t seek it out . Your mother ’s right — there is a difference . ”
13572	13607	13465	13465	Eva	2431	“ But you ’re also right , angel . If there ’s an audience for Corinne ’s book , there ’s a market void that needs to be filled and we should address that . ”
13619	13637	13638	13638	she	345	“ I was thinking we could ask Cary to take some candid photos of us this weekend , ”
13641	13674	13638	13638	she	345	“ Some moments that are more personal and casual than red carpet photo ops . We can sell the ones we like best to the media and donate the proceeds to Crossroads . ”
13754	13763	13764	13764	I	0	“ We can make it a day trip , ”
13782	13801	13764	13764	I	0	“ We can spend Friday night through Sunday morning in North Carolina , then spend Sunday in Westport . ”
13802	13819	13842	13842	she	984	“ Go from North Carolina to Connecticut to Manhattan in a day ? Are you nuts ? ”
13820	13829	13764	13764	I	0	“ Friday night through Saturday night , then . ”
13830	13841	13842	13842	she	984	“ We ca n’t be alone like that , Gideon , ”
13852	13896	13842	13842	she	984	“ We need to follow Dr. Petersen ’s advice for a while . I think we need to spend some time dating , going out in public , figuring out how to take care of … issues without using sex as a crutch . ”
13902	13913	13897	13897	I	0	“ You ’re not saying we ca n’t have sex . ”

14025	14093	14020	14020	She	984	“ I sometimes think I want you more , and I ’m okay with that . But Dr. Petersen ’s right . We moved so fast and we ’ve been hitting all the speed bumps at a hundred miles per hour . I feel like we have this little window of time when we can slow down . Just for a few weeks , until the wedding . ”
14094	14103	14104	14104	I	0	“ A few weeks ? Christ , Eva . ”
14172	14187	14165	14165	Her	984	“ Were n’t you the one who brought up the benefits of delayed gratification ? ”
14194	14203	14188	14188	I	0	“ And how well did that turn out ? ”
14268	14275	14276	14276	Eva	2431	“ We were different people then . ”

14312	14321	14322	14322	she	2431	“ And I ’m not the same woman , ”
14326	14366	14322	14322	she	2431	“ Yes , seeing Corinne today made me a little twitchy , but I know she ’s not a threat . I know you ’re committed . … We ’re committed . That ’s why we can do this . ”
14378	14385	14374	14374	I	0	“ I do n’t want to . ”
14386	14401	14402	14402	Her	2431	“ I do n’t either . But I think it ’s a good idea . ”
14409	14437	14402	14402	Her	2431	“ It ’s old - fashioned and romantic to wait ’ til the wedding night . Think how hot the sex will be when we do it . ”
14438	14453	14374	14374	I	0	“ Eva , we do n’t need our sex life to be any hotter . ”
14454	14478	14402	14402	Her	2431	“ We need it to be something we do for fun , not because we ’re counting on it to hold us together . ”
14479	14492	14493	14493	She	2431	“ It ’s both , and there ’s nothing wrong with that . ”
14519	14542	14493	14493	She	2431	“ Gideon … we have something amazing together . It ’s worth the effort to make us rock solid in every way . ”

14675	14704	14628	14628	she	2431	“ Do n’t be mad . I would n’t ask if I did n’t think it was important to try . And it ’s such a short time . ”
14705	14723	14661	14661	I	0	“ Eva , five minutes would be a short amount of time . You ’re talking weeks . ”
14724	14727	14728	14728	She	2431	“ Baby … ”

On my last break , I went online , trying to see if there was anything happening in September or October that I should consider when setting a date . Since we ’re getting married on the beach , we do n’t want it to be too cold , so we ’ve got to get it done this month or next . ”

To be honest , it freaked me out a little that some total stranger knew other details about you that I do n’t , which is another reason why I think we need to date each other and talk more — ”
15190	15203	14917	14917	she	2431	“ I can recite stats while we ’re fucking . Problem solved . ”
15209	15239	15204	15204	Her	533	“ You slay me . Anyway , having the wedding on your birthday is a good idea , do n’t you think ? You ’ll never forget our anniversary . ”

15689	15701	15683	15683	She	2431	“ I should ’ve known he ’d bring that up first . ”
15702	15711	15712	15712	he	0	“ What would you start with , Eva ? ”
15715	15727	15728	15728	She	2431	“ Gideon told me the details about his nightmare last night . ”
15733	15748	15728	15728	She	2431	“ That was huge . It ’s a really big turning point for us . ”
15878	15895	15871	15872	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Quite a few revelations for you this week , Gideon . What brought them on ? ”
15896	15900	15871	15872	Dr. Petersen	0	“ You know . ”
15901	15907	15871	15872	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Eva stopped seeing you . ”
15908	15914	15871	15872	Dr. Petersen	0	“ And speaking to me . ”
15920	15936	15915	15915	He	0	“ Was that because Gideon hired your boss away from the agency you work for ? ”
15937	15943	15944	15944	she	2431	“ That was the catalyst , ”
15947	15977	15944	15944	she	2431	“ but we ’d been building up to a breaking point . Something had to give . We could n’t keep going in circles , having the same arguments . ”
15978	15995	15915	15915	He	0	“ So you withdrew . That could be considered emotional blackmail . Was that your intent ? ”
16004	16011	15996	15996	Her	2431	“ I ’d call it desperation . ”
16012	16015	16090	16090	He	0	“ Why ? ”
16016	16044	15996	15996	Her	2431	“ Because Gideon was … drawing lines to define our relationship . And I could n’t imagine living within those lines for the rest of my life . ”
16051	16065	16045	16046	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Gideon , what do you think about how Eva handled this situation ? ”
16074	16089	16068	16068	me	0	“ It felt like a goddamned time warp , but a hundred times worse . ”
16095	16118	16090	16090	He	0	“ I remember when you first came to see me , you and Eva had n’t spoken for a couple of days . ”
16119	16125	16126	16126	she	2431	“ He cut me off , ”
16129	16134	16135	16135	I	0	“ She walked out , ”
16206	16221	16203	16203	Eva	2431	“ He broke it off with me via interoffice memo ! Who does that ? ”
16222	16230	16231	16231	I	0	“ I did n’t break it off , ”
16234	16250	16231	16231	I	0	“ I challenged you to come back . You walk away when things do n’t — ”
16251	16257	16258	16258	She	2431	“ That ’s emotional blackmail . ”
16268	16311	16258	16258	She	2431	“ You cut me off for the express purpose of making me accept your status quo . I do n’t like the way things are ? Well , then , you ’ll shut me out until I ca n’t take it anymore . ”
16312	16322	16323	16323	My	0	“ Did n’t you just do that to me ? ”
16327	16348	16323	16323	My	0	“ And you seem to take it just fine . If I do n’t change , you do n’t budge . ”
16395	16402	16403	16404	Dr. Petersen	0	“ You sound resentful , Gideon , ”
16407	16413	16414	16414	Eva	2431	“ And I do n’t ? ”
16424	16445	16419	16419	I	0	“ It ’s not resentment . It ’s … frustration . I ca n’t walk away , but she can . ”
16446	16502	16414	16414	Eva	2431	“ That ’s not fair ! And it ’s not true . The only leverage I ’ve got is to make you miss me . I try talking it out with you , but in the end , you do what you want . You do n’t tell me things , do n’t consult me . ”
16503	16510	16419	16419	I	0	“ I ’m working on that . ”
16511	16569	16414	16414	Eva	2431	“ Now you are , but I had to pull away to make you do it . Be honest , Gideon , I came along and you realized you had a void in your life that I could fill , and you wanted to put me there and leave the rest of your life as it was . ”
16570	16592	16419	16419	I	0	“ What I wanted was for you to let us — be us . Just enjoy each other for a while . ”
16593	16631	16414	16414	Eva	2431	“ My right to decide , to say yes or no , is fucking important to me ! You ’ve got no business taking that away from me or getting pissed when I do n’t like it ! ”
16632	16635	16419	16419	I	0	“ Jesus . ”
16677	16680	16666	16666	I	0	“ Eva … ”
16766	16801	16761	16761	I	0	“ Angel , I did n’t mean to make you feel powerless . I would never . Ever . I did n’t think of it that way . I ’m … I ’m sorry . ”
16876	16886	16870	16870	Her	547	“ Maybe I have n’t been explaining myself well . ”
16955	16977	16950	16950	She	2431	“ Did n’t it feel good , even a little bit , to talk to me about your dream last night ? ”
16978	16984	16985	16985	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
16989	17017	16985	16985	I	0	“ I just know you ’re happy with me because I did . If that ’s what it takes … then that ’s what I ’ll do . ”
17036	17043	17030	17030	She	2431	“ And now I feel guilty . ”
17071	17114	17063	17063	Eva	2431	“ I was thinking if he ’d just try it my way , he ’d see how much better it could be between us . But if I ’m just pushing him into a corner … if I ’m just blackmailing him … ”
17129	17151	17063	17063	Eva	2431	“ Maybe we have different ideas about what our marriage should be . What if that ’s not going to change ? ”
17152	17155	17156	17156	I	0	“ Eva . ”
17193	17200	17201	17202	Dr. Petersen	0	“ That ’s an important question , ”
17205	17232	17201	17202	Dr. Petersen	0	“ So let ’s explore it . What if the level of disclosure you want from Gideon is n’t something he will ever feel comfortable with ? ”
17233	17239	17240	17240	She	2431	“ I do n’t know . ”
17246	17256	17240	17240	She	2431	“ I do n’t know where that leaves us . ”
17305	17347	17301	17301	I	0	“ You quit your job for me , even though you did n’t want to . I told you about my dream , even though I did n’t want to . Is n’t that how this works ? We both compromise ? ”
17348	17356	17357	17358	Dr. Petersen	0	“ You left your job , Eva ? ”
17361	17364	17357	17358	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Why ? ”
17371	17407	17365	17365	She	2431	“ It was starting to cause more trouble than it was worth . Besides , Gideon ’s right — he gave a little , so it seems only fair to give a little , too . ”
17408	17449	17450	17450	He	0	“ I would n’t say what either of you compromised was ‘ little . ’ And both of you chose to open our session with other things first , which suggests neither of you are completely comfortable with the sacrifice . ”
17461	17476	17450	17450	He	0	“ Have either of you asked yourselves why you ’re in such a hurry ? ”
17486	17549	17483	17483	He	0	“ You ’re both frowning , so I ’ll take that as a no . As a couple , you have a lot of strengths . You may not be sharing everything , but you ’re communicating and you ’re doing so productively . There ’s some anger and frustration , but you ’re expressing them and validating each other ’s feelings . ”
17553	17557	17550	17550	Eva	2431	“ But … ? ”
17558	17653	17550	17550	Eva	2431	“ You ’re also both pushing personal agendas and manipulating each other to make them happen . My concern is that they ’re issues and changes that would naturally present themselves and be resolved in time , but neither of you wants to wait . You ’re both driving your relationship forward on an accelerated schedule . It ’s only been three months since you two met for the first time . At this point , most couples are deciding to date exclusively , but you two have been married for nearly a month . ”
17661	17671	17654	17654	I	0	“ What ’s the point in delaying the inevitable ? ”
17672	17678	17679	17679	he	0	“ If it ’s inevitable , ”
17686	17796	17679	17679	he	0	“ why rush it ? But that ’s not my point . You ’re both jeopardizing your marriage by forcing each other to act before you ’re ready . You each have ways of coping with adverse situations . Gideon , you disassociate , as you ’ve done with your family . Eva , you blame yourself for why the relationship is n’t working and start subverting your own needs , as you ’ve demonstrated with your previous self - destructive romantic relationships . If you continue to maneuver each other into situations where you feel threatened , you will eventually trigger one of these self - defense mechanisms . ”
17875	17885	17886	17886	Eva	2431	“ We ’re not going to let them win , ”
17939	17983	17920	17920	Her	2431	“ I ca n’t hold out against you , you know . It hurts too much to stay away . Just because you cross the battle lines first does n’t mean I ’m less invested . It just means I ’m more stubborn . ”
17984	17994	17920	17920	Her	2431	“ I do n’t want to fight with you . ”
17995	18001	18002	18002	she	2431	“ So let ’s not , ”
18006	18034	18002	18002	she	2431	“ We started something new today — you talking , me quitting . Let ’s stick with it for a while and see where it takes us . ”
18035	18041	17920	17920	Her	2431	“ I can do that . ”
18121	18125	18126	18126	she	2431	“ How pretty , ”
18342	18345	18346	18346	I	0	“ Angel . ”
18351	18407	18346	18346	I	0	“ I ’m going to ask you again , and then I ’ll let it go . Are you sure you want to quit your job ? You wo n’t hold it against me twenty years from now ? There ’s nothing we ca n’t fix or undo , if you just say the word . ”
18408	18423	18424	18424	Her	2431	“ Twenty years from now , you might be working for me , ace . ”
18438	18483	18424	18424	Her	2431	“ Do n’t worry , okay ? It was actually kind of a relief . I ’ve got a lot on my plate : packing , moving , planning . When that ’s all behind us , I ’ll figure out what ’s next . ”
18572	18579	18557	18557	Eva	2431	“ You are so insanely hot . ”
18584	18589	18580	18580	My	0	“ Am I now ? ”
18595	18621	18590	18590	Her	2431	“ You are — by far — the hottest man in the room , which makes this really fun . I like showing you off . ”
18628	18638	18622	18622	I	0	“ You still just want me for my body . ”
18639	18654	18590	18590	Her	2431	“ Totally . Who cares about your billions ? You ’ve got better assets . ”
18664	18678	18655	18655	I	0	“ Like my wife . She ’s the most valuable thing I own . ”
18685	18690	18679	18679	Her	2431	“ Own , huh ? ”
18833	18842	18825	18825	I	0	“ Have you changed your mind about waiting ? ”
18843	18851	18861	18861	She	2431	“ No . Just keeping things interesting . ”
18852	18857	18858	18858	I	0	“ Two can play , ”
18864	18873	18861	18861	She	2431	“ That ’s what I ’m counting on . ”
18875	18883	18884	18884	I	0	“ WHERE WILL YOU GO from here ? ”
18969	18977	18978	18978	Gideon	418	“ I ’m going up with you , ”
19029	19042	18992	18992	I	0	“ We need to say good - bye right here , ace . ”
19043	19046	18992	18992	I	0	“ Eva — ”
19047	19055	19056	19056	I	0	“ I do n’t have the willpower , ”
19117	19130	19131	19131	He	418	“ You and me with a bed nearby is a bad idea . ”
19149	19158	19131	19131	He	418	“ That ’s what I ’m counting on . ”
19159	19179	19185	19185	My	0	“ Count down instead — to our wedding . That ’s what I ’m doing . Minute by minute . ”
19243	19251	19227	19227	I	0	“ I ’m missing you , too . ”
19252	19261	19266	19266	I	0	“ You do n’t have to miss me . ”
19271	19280	19281	19281	I	0	“ You say when , you say how , ”
19293	19339	19281	19281	I	0	“ And part of me really wants you to say when right now . But there ’s something I want more than that . I ’ll call you later tonight , after I talk to Cary a bit , and tell you what that is . ”
19349	19361	19344	19344	His	418	“ You can just come next door and tell me now . ”
19427	19451	19469	19469	me	0	“ You need to go to the penthouse , Gideon . Just relax and enjoy that beautiful place we ’ll be sharing soon . ”
19452	19466	19469	19469	me	0	“ It ’s not the same without you there . It feels empty . ”
19518	19542	19543	19543	I	0	“ Now ’s your chance to get rid of all the things you do n’t want me to find when I move in , ”
19553	19560	19543	19543	I	0	“ You know all my secrets . ”
19561	19571	19543	19543	I	0	“ Tomorrow , we ’ll be together in Westport . ”
19572	19579	19543	19543	I	0	“ Tomorrow ’s too far away . ”
19591	19605	19586	19586	I	0	“ You ’ll sleep through some of it and work through the rest . ”
19610	19624	19586	19586	I	0	“ We could sext . You can see how creative I can be . ”
19625	19633	19651	19651	He	418	“ I prefer the original over reproductions . ”
19642	19650	19634	19634	I	0	“ Video , then . With sound . ”
19670	19675	19676	19676	he	418	“ This is love , ”
19679	19684	19676	19676	he	418	“ Agreeing to this . ”
19685	19689	19690	19690	I	0	“ I know . ”
19703	19716	19690	19690	I	0	“ You could send me naughty pics , too , you know . ”
19721	19738	19717	19717	His	418	“ You want pictures of me , angel , you ’ll have to take them yourself . ”
19751	19754	19744	19744	I	0	“ Spoilsport . ”
19788	19792	19793	19793	he	418	“ Miss me , ”
19802	19805	19796	19796	I	0	“ Always . ”
19929	19936	19937	19937	I	0	“ Honey , I ’m home ! ”

20152	20166	20110	20110	him	348	“ Pizza . Semi - homemade . It ’s what Tat was craving . ”
20167	20174	20175	20175	I	0	“ Who does n’t crave pizza ? ”
20184	20190	20175	20175	I	0	“ Is she still here ? ”
20191	20194	20195	20195	He	348	“ Nah . ”
20211	20229	20195	20195	He	348	“ She left all pissed off . I told her we would n’t be moving in together . ”
20230	20233	20238	20238	I	0	“ Oh . ”
20315	20319	20320	20320	I	0	“ Big decision , ”
20323	20335	20336	20336	He	594	“ And I ’m not sure it ’s the right one . ”
20345	20364	20336	20336	He	594	“ If Trey were n’t in the picture , I ’d be doing the right thing by Tat . ”
20365	20392	20320	20320	I	0	“ Who says you are n’t ? Being a good parent does n’t mean you have to live together . Look at my mom and dad . ”
20393	20396	20397	20397	He	594	“ Fuck . ”
20400	20426	20397	20397	He	594	“ I feel like I ’m choosing myself over my child , Eva . What does that make me , if not a selfish bastard ? ”
20427	20456	20473	20475	My best friend	418	“ It ’s not like you ’re cutting her off . I know you ’ll be there for her and the baby , just not in that way . ”
20508	20516	20531	20531	Cary	348	“ So Trey ’s going to stick ? ”
20517	20523	20531	20531	Cary	348	“ He has n’t decided . ”
20524	20530	20531	20531	Cary	348	“ Did he call you ? ”
20536	20552	20531	20531	Cary	348	“ No . I broke down and called him before he forgot about me altogether . ”
20560	20577	20553	20553	I	0	“ As if that could ever happen . You , Cary Taylor , are utterly unforgettable . ”
20578	20581	20582	20582	He	348	“ Ha . ”
20589	20613	20582	20582	He	348	“ He did n’t sound too happy to hear from me . Said he ’s still working some stuff out in his head . ”
20614	20623	20553	20553	I	0	“ Which means he ’s thinking about you . ”
20624	20633	20634	20634	Cary	348	“ Yeah , thinking he dodged a bullet , ”
20637	20705	20634	20634	Cary	348	“ He said it was never going to work for us if I was living with Tat , but when I told him I ’d fix that , he said that would just make him feel like an asshole for getting in the way . It ’s a no - win , but I laid it all out for Tat anyway , because I have to try . ”
20706	20716	20717	20717	I	0	“ It ’s a tough spot to be in . ”
20724	20757	20717	20717	I	0	“ Just try to make the best decisions you can . You have a right to be happy . That ’s the best thing for everyone around you , including the baby . ”
20758	20765	20766	20766	His	0	“ If there is a baby . ”
20770	20799	20766	20766	His	0	“ Tat says she ’s not doing this alone . If I ’m not going to be there , she does n’t want to go through with it . ”
20800	20814	20815	20815	I	0	“ Is n’t it getting a little late for her to say that ? ”
20851	20874	20875	20875	He	0	“ I ca n’t even think about it , Eva . I lose my shit . It ’s all so fucked up . ”
20882	20943	20875	20875	He	0	“ And to think I once said she was easy to deal with . She ’s never cared that I ’m bisexual , and she did n’t care if I slept around . … Part of me feels good that she cares enough now to want to be exclusive , but I ca n’t help how I feel about Trey . ”
20961	20969	20970	20970	I	0	“ Maybe I should talk to her , ”
20983	20998	20973	20973	He	0	“ How is that supposed to help ? You two do n’t get along . ”
20999	21006	21007	21007	I	0	“ I ’m not a fan , ”
21010	21045	21046	21046	I	0	“ But I can work around that . A woman - to - woman talk — if it ’s done right — could help . It really could n’t make things worse , right ? ”
21067	21073	21064	21064	He	0	“ There ’s always worse . ”
21074	21083	21084	21084	I	0	“ Way to look on the bright side , ”
21087	21103	21084	21084	I	0	“ Does Trey know that you talked to Tatiana and she ’s not moving in ? ”
21104	21121	21064	21064	He	0	“ I texted him . Got nada back . But I really did n’t expect to . ”
21122	21130	21084	21084	I	0	“ Give him a little more time . ”
21131	21198	21064	21064	He	0	“ Eva , at the end of the day , he wishes I were totally gay . In his mind , being bisexual means I have to sleep around . He does n’t get that just because I ’m attracted to men and women does n’t mean I ca n’t be faithful to one person . Or maybe he just does n’t want to get it . ”
21205	21230	21199	21199	I	0	“ I do n’t think I helped with that . He brought it up to me once and I did n’t explain things well . ”
21281	21293	21294	21294	He	348	“ You ca n’t fix everything for me , baby girl . ”
21305	21315	21294	21294	He	348	“ But I love you so much for trying . ”
21316	21323	21324	21324	I	0	“ You ’re part of me . ”
21332	21342	21324	21324	I	0	“ I need you to be okay , Cary . ”
21343	21350	21351	21351	He	348	“ I ’m working on it . ”
21360	21390	21351	21351	He	348	“ I ’m taking this weekend in Westport to deal with the possibility that Trey might be out of the mix . I have to be realistic about that . ”
21391	21401	21324	21324	I	0	“ You be realistic , I ’ll be hopeful . ”
21402	21408	21409	21409	He	348	“ Have fun with that . ”
21424	21459	21409	21409	He	348	“ Which brings me back to Tatiana . I guess I am clear about that . We ca n’t be together . Baby or not , it would n’t work for her or me . ”
21460	21465	21417	21417	his	348	“ I respect that . ”
21582	21613	21564	21564	His	348	“ I ca n’t pick and choose based on what I ’m going to get out of it . Sucks , but hey … I got ta grow up sometime . ”
21614	21620	21621	21621	I	0	“ Do n’t we all ? ”
21628	21635	21621	21621	I	0	“ I quit my job today . ”
21650	21654	21564	21564	His	348	“ No shit ? ”
21664	21668	21661	21661	I	0	“ No shit . ”
21672	21684	21669	21669	He	348	“ Should I break out the bourbon and some shot glasses ? ”
21688	21713	21669	21669	He	348	“ Ugh . You know I ca n’t stand bourbon . And really , Cristal and flutes would be more appropriate for my resignation . ”
21714	21722	21669	21669	He	348	“ Seriously ? You want to celebrate ? ”
21723	21738	21739	21739	I	0	“ I do n’t need to drown any sorrows , that ’s for sure . ”
21756	21768	21739	21739	I	0	“ I ’ve been thinking about it all day , though . ”
21769	21772	21669	21669	He	348	“ And ? ”
21773	21834	21739	21739	I	0	“ I ’m good . Maybe if Mark had taken the news differently , I ’d have second thoughts , but he ’s leaving , too , and he ’s been there way longer than the three months I ’ve been there . It would n’t make sense for me to be more upset about moving on than he is . ”
21835	21850	21855	21855	he	601	“ Baby girl , things do n’t have to make sense to be true . ”
21862	21913	21739	21739	I	0	“ You ’re right , but I found Gideon at the same time I started at Waters Field and Leaman . Practically speaking , there ’s no comparison between a job you ’ve had three months and a husband you ’re going to spend the rest of your life with . ”
21920	21934	21914	21914	He	601	“ You went from sensible to practical . This just keeps getting worse . ”
21935	21941	21942	21942	Cary	348	“ Oh , shut up . ”
21977	21982	21973	21973	My	0	“ I want more . ”
21983	21987	21973	21973	My	0	“ More what ? ”
21988	21993	21994	21994	I	0	“ More of everything . ”
22000	22028	21994	21994	I	0	“ Gideon ’s got this presence , you know ? When he walks into a room , everyone straightens up and pays attention . I want that . ”
22029	22047	21973	21973	My	0	“ You married that . You get it de facto with the name and the bank balance . ”
22052	22092	22048	22048	I	0	“ I want it because I ’ve earned it , Cary . Geoffrey Cross left behind a lot of people who want some payback from his son . And Gideon ’s made his own enemies , like the Lucases . ”
22093	22097	21994	21994	I	0	“ The who ? ”
22103	22116	22098	22098	I	0	“ The bat - shit Anne Lucas and her equally insane husband . ”
22122	22155	22098	22098	I	0	“ Oh my God , Cary ! I did n’t tell you . About the redhead you messed around with at that dinner a few weeks back . That was Anne Lucas . ”
22156	22165	22187	22187	Cary	348	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
22166	22186	22098	22098	I	0	“ Remember when I asked you to run a search on Dr. Terrence Lucas ? Anne is his wife . ”
22331	22369	22323	22323	I	0	“ The Lucases have this whole twisted history thing with Gideon that I ca n’t get into , but it ’s no coincidence that you two ended up together that night . She planned it that way . ”
22370	22373	22413	22413	my	0	“ Why ? ”
22374	22389	22323	22323	I	0	“ Because she ’s nuts and she knows it ’ll fuck with my head . ”
22390	22402	22413	22413	my	0	“ Why the hell would you care who I tangle with ? ”
22403	22410	22323	22323	I	0	“ Cary … I always care . ”
22420	22425	22432	22433	my husband	418	“ Hanging by a Moment ”
22439	22472	22436	22436	I	0	“ But in this case , it ’s the calculation behind it . You were n’t just some random hot fling . She targeted you specifically because you ’re my best friend . ”
22473	22483	22432	22433	my husband	418	“ I ’m not seeing how that accomplishes anything . ”
22484	22504	22436	22436	I	0	“ It ’s flipping the bird at Gideon . Getting his attention is what she wants more than anything . ”
22510	22530	22505	22505	Cary	348	“ The whole thing sounds loopy , but whatever . I ran into her again not too long ago . ”
22531	22536	22432	22433	my husband	418	“ What ? When ? ”
22537	22543	22544	22544	He	348	“ Last week , maybe . ”
22547	22587	22544	22544	He	348	“ I ’d just wrapped up a shoot and my Uber was waiting outside the studio . She was stepping out of a café with a girlfriend at the same time . It was totally out of the blue . ”
22598	22609	22588	22588	I	0	“ No way . Did she say anything to you ? ”
22610	22675	22544	22544	He	348	“ Sure . She kinda flirted a little , which is n’t surprising considering the last time we saw each other . I shut her down , told her I was working on a relationship . She was cool about it . Wished me luck , said thanks again for a fun time . She took off down the street . End of story . ”
22682	22699	22676	22676	My	0	“ If you ever see her , walk the other way and call me . Okay ? ”
22700	22719	22798	22798	Cary	348	“ O - kay , but you ’re not telling me enough for this to make any sense . ”
22720	22727	22728	22728	I	0	“ Let me talk with Gideon . ”
22737	22740	22728	22728	I	0	“ Hey . ”
22741	22748	22749	22749	Gideon	418	“ Were you in the shower ? ”
22752	22761	22749	22749	Gideon	418	“ Are you naked and wet , angel ? ”
22762	22772	22773	22773	I	0	“ Oh , God . Hang on a minute . ”
22786	22797	22773	22773	I	0	“ Was she wearing a wig when you saw her ? ”
22804	22812	22798	22798	Cary	348	“ How the hell would I know ? ”
22813	22824	22773	22773	I	0	“ Was it long like when you first met her ? ”
22825	22830	22798	22798	Cary	348	“ Yeah . Same . ”
22909	22927	22901	22901	I	0	“ I need you to come back over , Gideon . And bring Angus up with you . ”
23106	23113	23114	23114	he	418	“ Hello to you , too , ”
23267	23286	23256	23256	Gideon	418	“ You ’re giving me that look , angel , but you wanted Angus with me . Explain . ”
23303	23321	23289	23289	me	0	“ How can I help it when it looks like you were stripping when I called you ? ”
23322	23328	23256	23256	Gideon	418	“ I can finish here . ”
23329	23350	23289	23289	me	0	“ You realize I may have to burn all your clothes after the wedding . You should always be naked . ”
23351	23360	23256	23256	Gideon	418	“ Would make for interesting meetings at work . ”
23361	23377	23378	23378	I	0	“ Umm … maybe not , then . For my eyes only and all that . ”
23389	23400	23378	23378	I	0	“ Anne ’s made contact with Cary since the dinner . ”
23499	23507	23493	23493	he	418	“ Tell me what you told Eva . ”
23556	23561	23562	23562	he	348	“ That ’s it , ”
23565	23592	23562	23562	he	348	“ No offense , guys , but you seem like a lot of muscle for a redhead who ’s maybe a hundred twenty pounds soaking wet . ”
23611	23617	23618	23618	I	0	“ Better safe than sorry , ”
23627	23642	23621	23621	He	348	“ What can she do ? Seriously . What ’s everyone all anxious about ? ”
23647	23666	23643	23643	Gideon	418	“ We had an … affair . That ’s not the right word . It was n’t pretty . ”
23667	23672	23673	23673	Cary	348	“ You fucked her , ”
23677	23683	23673	23673	Cary	348	“ I figured that much . ”
23684	23689	23690	23690	I	0	“ Fucked her over , ”
23782	23795	23761	23761	she	621	“ She ’s not taking it well that he ’s with me . ”
23796	23808	23761	23761	she	621	“ What ? Are we talking Fatal Attraction – type stuff ? ”
23809	23840	23761	23761	she	621	“ Well , she ’s a psychologist , so Fatal Attraction meets Basic Instinct would be more accurate . It ’s a Michael Douglas marathon wrapped up in one woman . ”
23841	23848	23849	23849	Gideon	418	“ Do n’t joke , Eva , ”
23853	23858	23859	23859	I	0	“ Who ’s joking ? ”
23863	23891	23859	23859	I	0	“ Cary saw her in that long wig she wore to the dinner . I ’m thinking she wanted him to recognize her so they could chat . ”
23895	23920	23892	23892	Cary	348	“ So she ’s crazy town . What do you want me to do ? Let you know if I run into her again ? ”
23921	23930	23931	23931	I	0	“ I want a protection detail on you , ”
23937	23940	23934	23934	Gideon	418	“ Agreed . ”
23941	23944	23945	23945	Cary	348	“ Wow . ”
23956	23966	23945	23945	Cary	348	“ You guys are hard - core about this . ”
23967	23975	23976	23976	I	0	“ You ’ve got enough going on , ”
23980	23997	23976	23976	I	0	“ If she ’s got an agenda , you do n’t need to deal with it . ”
24003	24010	23998	23998	His	348	“ Ca n’t argue with that . ”
24011	24019	24020	24020	Angus	73	“ We ’ll take care of it , ”
24048	24073	24074	24074	he	348	“ I do n’t think you two need me anymore , so I ’m hitting it . I ’ll catch you in the morning , ”
24088	24093	24094	24094	I	0	“ Are you worried ? ”
24102	24110	24094	24094	I	0	“ You are . That ’s enough . ”
24123	24145	24111	24111	I	0	“ It ’s not so much worry . More like curiosity . What does she think she can accomplish through Cary ? ”
24150	24163	24146	24146	Gideon	418	“ She ’s playing head games , Eva . That ’s all . ”
24164	24205	24146	24146	Gideon	418	“ I do n’t think so . She was very specific in her comments to me at the dinner , warning me away from you . Like I do n’t know you and would n’t want you if I did . ”
24248	24257	24258	24258	I	0	“ I ’m going to talk to Anne , ”
24270	24276	24261	24261	Gideon	418	“ The hell you are . ”
24303	24332	24298	24301	a woman like me	439	“ I know we ’ve covered a lot of ground over the course of our relationship , but somewhere in there we did discuss working as a team . ”
24333	24342	24343	24343	he	0	“ And I ’m open to doing that , ”
24347	24368	24343	24343	he	0	“ but Anne is not the place to start . You ca n’t reason with someone who ’s completely irrational . ”
24369	24422	24298	24301	a woman like me	439	“ I do n’t want to reason with her , ace . She ’s targeting my friends , and she thinks I ’m a weak spot for you . She needs to know I ’m not helpless , and that by taking you on , she ’s taking on both of us . ”
24423	24435	24343	24343	he	0	“ She ’s my problem . I ’ll deal with her . ”
24436	24474	24475	24475	I	0	“ If you ’ve got a problem , Gideon , it ’s my problem , too . Listen . Operation Gideva is in full effect now . My inaction is only making this situation with Anne worse . ”
24479	24534	24475	24475	I	0	“ In her mind , either I know what ’s happening and I ’m too weak to do something or you ’re hiding everything from me , which suggests that I ’m too weak to handle it . Either way , you ’re making me a target and that ’s not what you want . ”
24535	24546	24547	24547	he	0	“ You do n’t know what ’s in her mind , ”
24551	24585	24475	24475	I	0	“ Things are a little twisted up there , sure . But she ’s a woman . Trust me , she needs to know I have claws and am prepared to use them . ”
24590	24596	24586	24586	His	0	“ What would you say ? ”
24609	24670	24603	24603	me	0	“ Honestly , I think it ’s enough if I just pop up somewhere unexpected . An ambush , so to speak . That ’ll shake her a little , to find me lying in wait . Will she go on the defensive or take the offense ? We ’ll get insight from her reaction , and we need it . ”
24676	24683	24671	24671	Gideon	418	“ I do n’t like it . ”
24684	24692	24693	24693	I	0	“ I did n’t think you would . ”
24701	24739	24693	24693	I	0	“ But you know I ’m right . It ’s not my strategy that ’s bugging you , Gideon . More like your past wo n’t go away and you do n’t want it in my face . ”
24740	24753	24671	24671	Gideon	418	“ It will go away , Eva . Let me handle it . ”
24754	24834	24693	24693	I	0	“ You need to be more analytical about this . I ’m a member of your team , like Angus and Raúl , but obviously I ’m not an employee and I ’m sure as hell not a dependent — I’m your better half . It ’s not just Gideon Cross anymore . It ’s not even Gideon Cross and wife . We are Gideon and Eva Cross , and you need to let me live up to that . ”
24845	24856	24835	24835	He	634	“ You do n’t have anything to prove to anyone . ”
24857	24882	24693	24693	I	0	“ Really ? Because I feel like I have to prove something to you . If you do n’t believe I ’m strong enough … ”
24883	24886	24887	24887	Gideon	418	“ Eva . ”
24901	24910	24887	24887	Gideon	418	“ You ’re the strongest woman I know . ”
24947	24952	24953	24953	I	0	“ Then stop worrying , ”
24956	24967	24953	24953	I	0	“ and let me do what I have to do . ”
24968	24980	24953	24953	I	0	“ I do n’t agree that you have to do anything . ”
24981	24991	24992	24992	I	0	“ Then you ’ll have to agree to disagree . ”
25016	25019	24953	24953	I	0	“ Angel — ”
25020	25053	25001	25001	his	634	“ To be clear , I was n’t asking permission , Gideon . I ’m telling you what I ’m doing . You can either participate or stand back — your choice . ”
25061	25073	25054	25054	He	634	“ Where ’s the compromise you ’re always pushing me for ? ”
25083	25110	25077	25077	I	0	“ The compromise is letting me try it my way this time . If it does n’t work , we try it your way next time . ”
25111	25114	25197	25197	Gideon	418	“ Thanks . ”
25115	25176	25177	25177	I	0	“ Do n’t be like that . We ’ll sit down together to work out the logistics of when and where . We ’ll need Raúl to get a handle on her routine . By definition , an ambush is unexpected , but it should happen somewhere she feels safe and comfortable , too . Give her a nice jolt . ”
25180	25196	25177	25177	I	0	“ She ’s laid down the ground rules . We ’re just taking her cue . ”
25234	25256	25228	25228	I	0	“ Remember this morning , when I said I ’d explain why I decided to tell my parents about our marriage ? ”
25268	25272	25257	25257	His	634	“ Of course . ”
25273	25299	25304	25304	him	634	“ I know it took a lot of courage for you to tell Dr. Petersen about Hugh . Especially considering how you feel about psychologists . ”
25329	25338	25309	25309	Hugh	123	“ You inspired me to be equally brave . ”
25346	25353	25354	25354	he	634	“ I heard that song today , ”
25375	25383	25384	25384	he	634	“ You needed me to tell him , ”
25403	25409	25384	25384	he	634	“ Yeah , I did . ”
25470	25478	25530	25530	Gideva	136	“ And you need to confront Anne . ”
25483	25501	25479	25479	My	0	“ I actually was n’t swinging the conversation back to that , but yeah … I do . ”
25508	25518	25505	25505	Gideon	418	“ All right . We ’ll figure it out . ”
25532	25548	25549	25549	he	634	“ You also said there was something you wanted more than having sex with me , ”
25563	25575	25576	25576	I	0	“ Well , I would n’t put it quite like that . ”
25584	25595	25576	25576	I	0	“ Banging you is literally my favorite activity . Ever . ”
25599	25602	25596	25596	He	634	“ But ? ”
25603	25613	25576	25576	I	0	“ You ’re going to think I ’m silly . ”
25614	25623	25596	25596	He	634	“ I ’ll still think you ’re hot . ”
25630	25657	25624	25624	I	0	“ In high school , most of the girls I knew had boyfriends . You know how it is , raging hormones and epic love stories . ”
25658	25663	25664	25664	he	634	“ So I heard , ”
25720	25723	25764	25764	his	634	“ Angel ? ”
25728	25736	25724	25724	I	0	“ Forget it . It ’s lame . ”

25778	25822	25823	25823	I	0	“ Fine . Teenagers talk on the phone at night for hours because they have school and parents and ca n’t be together . They spend all night chatting with their boyfriends about … whatever . I never had that . I never … ”

25891	25924	25884	25884	I	0	“ I had this idea that we could have that for now … while we ’re waiting . Late - night calls where we talk just to hear each other ’s voice . ”
25930	25938	25939	25939	I	0	“ It sounded better in my head , ”
25980	25990	25942	25942	Gideon	418	“ I ’m that guy for you , Eva . ”

26533	26576	26527	26527	He	348	“ If anyone gets wind that I ’ve got a private security detail , they ’ll think either I ’m bigger shit than they knew or I ’ve got an inflated sense of my own importance . Both of which are true . ”
26589	26607	26579	26579	I	0	“ You wo n’t even know they ’re around . They ’ll be in super stealth mode . ”

26757	26785	26733	26733	He	348	“ I figured the honeymoon period lasted longer than that . Do n’t most husbands get laid at least a few years before they get cut off ? ”
26786	26792	26793	26793	I	0	“ Shut up , Cary ! ”
26820	26823	26804	26804	Gideon	418	“ Angel . ”

27474	27482	27483	27483	he	418	“ Steven and I talked it out , ”
27500	27525	27483	27483	he	418	“ Hiring you was a big step up for me . It was a sign that my career was moving in the right direction . ”
27526	27534	27483	27483	he	418	“ There ’s no doubt about that . ”
27538	27552	27535	27535	He	418	“ Losing you is another sign — it ’s time to move on . ”

27944	27950	27951	27951	I	0	“ You never had to . ”
27964	27989	27954	27954	I	0	“ Mark does n’t want me to know where we ’re headed , so I ’ll just climb in and try not to eavesdrop . ”
28024	28040	28010	28010	Mark	116	“ Whoa . I ’ve rented limos before , but they never looked like this . ”
28041	28047	28010	28010	Mark	116	“ Gideon has great taste . ”

28173	28251	28170	28170	Mark	116	“ Steven ’s killing me . Do I want blue or periwinkle ? Roses or lilies ? Satin or silk ? Morning or evening ? I tried to tell him that he can do what he wants , I just want him , but he chewed me out . Said I damned well better care because I did n’t have a chance of ever getting married again . All I can say is thank God for that . ”

31820	31874	31771	31771	Her	2431	“ Actually , she told you not to call her Mom , but I get it . You ’re their son by marriage and it ’s freaking you out . Still , is it so terrible that they ’re happy about it ? Would you prefer it if they were like my dad ? ”

32014	32033	32010	32010	I	0	“ It ’s not the same thing . No one gives a shit whether a stepparent likes you . ”

32462	32511	32455	32455	She	2431	“ I ’m sorry you feel ambushed . I ’m really sorry that being welcomed with open arms makes you lose your damn mind . But you ’re going to have to get used to it because it ’s all part of the package you got with me . ”

39318	39358	39226	39226	He	0	“ I do n’t know what she ’s so upset about . I could n’t have asked for a better picture of Gideon and me if I ’d tried . It ’s perfect for making Corinne Giroux look desperate . ”

39367	39403	39363	39363	His	0	“ And honestly , it ’s good to see Gideon so into you . He had a stick up his ass most of the weekend . I was starting to think he was cooling off . ”

39449	39472	39442	39442	he	418	“ It was n’t personal , Cary . Remember how he acted at the Vidal Records party at his parents ’ house ? ”

39480	39538	39477	39477	He	418	“ Not my problem anyway . Do you want me to reach out to some friends and see if we ca n’t put the word out while we ’re strutting our stuff this week ? Your bikini blew up the Internet . I ca n’t imagine any designer turning down the chance to design your wedding dress . ”
39566	39619	39563	39563	me	0	“ I do n’t know . It would suck royally if word got out about how soon it ’s all going down . I do n’t want a media circus . It ’s bad enough we ca n’t even go out of town for the weekend without some creepy photographer following us . ”

40986	41027	40952	40952	He	348	“ I ca n’t see you going into any old salon without making a scene . You ’ll have to find someone you trust to style you in private appointments . In the meantime , Mario can rock a haircut . ”

42914	42966	42904	42905	Lynn Feng	159	“ many of our recipients want to acknowledge and thank Crossroads for its support . They hold luncheons or dinners , which also act as fund - raisers .

43629	43661	43623	43623	he	418	“ I hate to cut this short , but I have an afternoon meeting coming up . I could be generous and leave Eva with you , but I wo n’t . ”
43675	43678	43670	43670	He	418	“ Ready ? ”
43679	43685	43686	43686	I	0	“ Give me a minute , ”
44043	44063	44030	44030	she	880	“ Eva . I almost did n’t recognize you . I love what you ’ve done with your hair . ”
44102	44105	44108	44108	I	0	“ Hello . ”
44290	44298	44280	44280	Angela	0	“ It ’s good to see you . ”
44299	44304	44280	44280	Angela	0	“ You , too . ”
44380	44385	44386	44386	Angela	0	“ I was wondering — ”
44406	44445	44464	44464	she	0	“ — if you ’ll be attending the Grey Isles show this week ? Your close friend — the one who ’s living with you — he ’s the face of their latest campaign , is n’t he ? ”
44549	44564	44565	44565	I	0	“ I do n’t have plans to attend any of the Fashion Week shows , ”
44584	44597	44569	44569	Her	0	“ That ’s a shame . I thought we might go together . ”
44721	44726	44727	44727	I	0	“ Not this time , ”
44809	44815	44791	44791	She	0	“ Maybe some other time . ”
44987	44990	44991	44991	he	96	“ Eva , ”
45011	45017	44991	44991	he	96	“ What a pleasant surprise . ”
45018	45023	45024	45024	I	0	“ Hello , Ryan . ”
45050	45070	45024	45024	I	0	“ I was just talking about you earlier today . Heard that you ’ve left Waters Field and Leaman . ”
45141	45157	45137	45137	I	0	“ I miss it already , but then Gideon and I are attached to Mark . ”
45158	45169	45104	45104	he	418	“ Yes , I ’ve heard great things about him . ”
45170	45193	45137	45137	I	0	“ He really knows his stuff . It was while Mark was working on the Kingsman Vodka campaign that I met Gideon . ”
45200	45208	45194	45194	Landon	96	“ I would n’t have guessed that . ”
45212	45245	45209	45209	I	0	“ You ’re in great hands . Mark is the best . I ’d be more sad about leaving if I did n’t know that we ’ll be working with him again . ”
45250	45300	45246	45246	He	96	“ Well … We ’ve decided to let LanCorp ’s in - house team run with it . They really felt like they could knock it out of the park and since that ’s what I hired them to do , I figured I better let them do it . ”
45301	45315	45316	45316	I	0	“ Ah . I look forward to seeing what they come up with . ”
45322	45335	45316	45316	I	0	“ It was great seeing you both again . Enjoy your lunch . ”
45459	45462	45467	45467	Gideon	418	“ Eva . ”
45534	45539	45540	45540	he	418	“ You ’re beautiful , ”
45550	45572	45540	45540	he	418	“ You ’re always changing . I never know who I ’m going to have from one day to the next . ”
45616	45627	45611	45611	him	418	“ Got ta keep you on your toes , ace . ”
45642	45647	45628	45628	Gideon	418	“ I want you . ”
45648	45654	45655	45655	I	0	“ I should hope so , ”
45669	45678	45655	45655	I	0	“ You ’re stuck with me for life . ”
45679	45684	45689	45689	he	418	“ Not long enough . ”
45730	45733	45722	45722	I	0	“ Gideon . ”
45734	45742	45743	45743	he	418	“ Let ’s go to the penthouse , ”
45776	45782	45783	45783	I	0	“ You have a meeting , ”
45786	45791	45783	45783	I	0	“ Fuck the meeting . ”
45851	45859	45860	45860	I	0	“ I love the way you smell , ”
45889	45915	45869	45869	He	418	“ There ’s something about it . It touches something inside me . It ’s one of the things that tells me you ’re mine . ”
45919	45926	45927	45927	he	418	“ I ’m so fucking hard , ”
45953	45960	45961	45961	I	0	“ I ’m so fucking wet , ”
45965	45973	45961	45961	I	0	“ You made me so happy today . ”
45991	45994	45974	45974	His	418	“ Good . ”
46068	46087	46060	46060	My	0	“ Thank you . It ’s not enough for what you gave me today , but thank you . ”
46099	46104	46092	46092	He	418	“ You ’re welcome . ”
46105	46114	46092	46092	He	418	“ I ’m glad you like my hair . ”
46115	46125	46092	46092	He	418	“ I like when you feel confident and sexy . ”
46148	46160	46126	46126	I	0	“ What if I need purple hair to feel that way ? ”
46165	46177	46161	46161	His	418	“ Then I ’ll be fucking a purple - haired wife . ”
46193	46209	46161	46161	His	418	“ As long as the inside remains the same , the rest is just wrapping . ”
46231	46238	46239	46239	I	0	“ Did you see the Landons ? ”
46247	46253	46243	46243	Gideon	418	“ They talked to you . ”
46258	46270	46254	46254	My	0	“ You knew they ’d be there , did n’t you ? ”
46271	46278	46243	46243	Gideon	418	“ It was n’t a surprise . ”
46279	46288	46289	46289	I	0	“ You ’re so good at being cagey , ”
46292	46329	46289	46289	I	0	“ All you guys are . I could n’t figure out if Angela Landon was yanking my chain when she asked to attend the Grey Isles Fashion Week show with me or if she was serious . ”
46330	46342	46243	46243	Gideon	418	“ Maybe a little of both . What did you say ? ”
46343	46350	46351	46351	I	0	“ That I ’m not going . ”
46371	46381	46382	46382	I	0	“ Corinne would ’ve known how to manage her . ”
46385	46395	46382	46382	I	0	“ Probably Magdalene , too . Certainly my mom . ”
46396	46405	46421	46421	He	418	“ You did fine . What about Landon ? ”
46410	46420	46406	46406	My	0	“ How tightly do you have Mark locked in ? ”
46428	46434	46421	46421	He	418	“ What did you do ? ”
46435	46471	46382	46382	I	0	“ I mentioned we have a strong connection with Mark , since you and I met while you were working with him . I said we look forward to working with him in the future . ”
46472	46485	46421	46421	He	418	“ You want to see if Landon will offer Mark a job . ”
46486	46559	46382	46382	I	0	“ I ’m curious to see how far Landon will go , yes . I ’m not worried about Mark . He ’s loyal and while he does n’t know the particulars , he knows LanCorp is part of the reason I quit . Plus , he ’s got an in with the head honcho at Cross Industries . He ’d just be a drone at LanCorp . He ’s not stupid . ”
46586	46603	46576	46576	I	0	“ And you want to see if I was straight with you about Landon ’s motives . ”
46604	46607	46608	46608	I	0	“ No . ”
46648	46672	46637	46637	Gideon	418	“ I believe you . I believed you when you told me . Your word is all the proof I ’ll ever need . ”
46689	46693	46673	46673	He	418	“ Thank you . ”
46694	46707	46708	46708	I	0	“ But maybe you felt the need to prove it to me ? ”
46712	46762	46708	46708	I	0	“ You find out Landon ’s got a reservation . You want to introduce me to the Crossroads board . Meeting at Tableau One accomplishes two things if I run into Landon while I ’m there . Although there was a lot left to faith for that to happen . ”
46763	46773	46673	46673	He	418	“ Not if he ’s seated by the bathrooms . ”
46774	46785	46708	46708	I	0	“ Maybe I would n’t have gone to the bathroom . ”
46792	46800	46801	46801	I	0	“ It was n’t a foregone conclusion , ”
46804	46810	46811	46811	he	418	“ You ’re a woman , ”
46824	46833	46811	46811	he	418	“ Sometimes I just want to smack you . ”
46834	46842	46849	46849	His	418	“ I ca n’t help being right . ”
46843	46848	46811	46811	he	418	“ You ’re deflecting . ”
46856	46874	46849	46849	His	418	“ You left me because of him . I needed you to see him again after that . ”
46875	46892	46897	46897	I	0	“ That ’s not entirely accurate , but okay . I see what you were after . ”
46907	46945	46897	46897	I	0	“ I still could n’t get a sense of them , though . He ’s a little easier to read than his wife , but they both play sincere very well . And they ’re a team . ”
46946	46954	46849	46849	His	418	“ You and I are a team . ”
46955	46973	46897	46897	I	0	“ We ’re getting there . I need to learn how to hold up my end better . ”
46974	46980	46849	46849	His	418	“ I have no complaints . ”
46984	47002	46981	46981	I	0	“ I did n’t fuck up , which is n’t the same as doing a good job . ”
47009	47070	47003	47003	His	0	“ I would n’t care if you fucked it up , although I ’m sure your definition of what that would be is very different from mine . I would n’t care if you have green hair or purple hair or whatever color you choose , although I ’ll say I like it blond . You ’re what I want . ”
47080	47086	47075	47075	I	0	“ Angela looks like Corinne . ”
47094	47101	47087	47087	He	0	“ No , she does not . ”
47102	47128	47087	47087	He	0	“ Oh my God , she totally does ! I mean , not like twins or anything . But the hair and the body type . ”
47134	47137	47129	47129	Gideon	418	“ No . ”
47138	47153	47087	47087	He	0	“ Do you think Landon went for someone who looks like your ideal woman ? ”
47154	47165	47166	47166	He	418	“ I think your imagination is running away with you . ”
47180	47196	47166	47166	He	418	“ And if not , he got it wrong , so the point is moot . ”
47244	47254	47255	47255	I	0	“ I asked Raúl to track down Anne today , ”
47266	47272	47273	47273	he	418	“ You ’re damned stubborn , ”
47277	47289	47290	47290	I	0	“ As you pointed out , I feel confident and sexy . ”
47296	47306	47290	47290	I	0	“ It ’s a good day to say hi . ”
47337	47366	47326	47327	my husband	317	“ You ’ll do whatever Angus says . If he does n’t think it ’s a good idea when the time comes , you back off . Understood ? ”
47382	47385	47376	47376	I	0	“ Okay . ”
47386	47398	47326	47327	my husband	317	“ And you ’ll come to the penthouse tonight for dinner . ”
47399	47407	47376	47376	I	0	“ When did this become a negotiation ? ”
47418	47454	47326	47327	my husband	317	“ I told Cary I ’d take him out to dinner , ace . He ’s been making calls for me today while I ’ve been with you . You ’re welcome to come along . ”
47455	47464	47408	47408	He	418	“ No , thanks . Come over afterward . ”
47465	47470	47326	47327	my husband	317	“ Will you behave ? ”
47477	47483	47471	47471	His	418	“ Only if you do . ”
47502	47505	47497	47497	we	930	“ Deal . ”
47604	47615	47592	47592	He	418	“ Call my cell as soon as you ’re done . ”
47616	47622	47592	47592	He	418	“ What if you ’re — ”
47623	47627	47592	47592	He	418	“ Call me . ”
47628	47632	47592	47592	He	418	“ All right . ”
47764	47768	47755	47755	He	418	“ Where to ? ”
47769	47775	47732	47732	His	418	“ Wherever Anne Lucas works . ”
47776	47785	47755	47755	He	418	“ She may be working for hours yet . ”
47786	47820	47732	47732	His	418	“ I figured . I ’ve got a few things I can handle while I wait . If I run out of things to do , we ’ll try again some other time . ”
47821	47825	47826	47826	He	418	“ Got it . ”
47838	47841	47842	47842	he	418	“ Hey , ”
47845	47850	47842	47842	he	418	“ How was lunch ? ”
47851	47856	47857	47857	I	0	“ It was good . ”
47862	47865	47866	47866	he	418	“ Eventful , ”
47872	47908	47866	47866	he	418	“ Ca n’t say I get the whole Landon thing , but then I do n’t understand much of what goes on with your old man . Is there anyone not pissed off at him ? ”
47909	47912	47842	47842	he	418	“ Me . ”
47913	47923	47866	47866	he	418	“ Right , but you ’re not banging him . ”
47924	47937	47842	47842	he	418	“ Cary , I ’m going to kill you , I swear . ”
47946	47984	47938	47938	His	418	“ I got in touch with Blaire . He said he can meet you at the penthouse tomorrow if you like . Just text him a window of time and he ’ll see what he can do . ”
47985	47992	47866	47866	he	418	“ Sweet . How about Kristin ? ”
47993	48041	47938	47938	His	418	“ Getting to that , baby girl . She ’s in the office all day today , so you can call her anytime . Or drop her an e - mail , if that ’s easier . She ’s champing at the bit to talk to you . ”
48042	48059	47866	47866	he	418	“ I ’ll call her . You figure out where we ’re going to dinner yet ? ”
48060	48076	47938	47938	His	418	“ I feel like Asian . Chinese , Japanese , Thai … something like that . ”
48077	48089	47866	47866	he	418	“ Well , all right , then . Asian it is . ”
48099	48104	47866	47866	he	418	“ Thanks , Cary . ”
48105	48116	47938	47938	His	418	“ Happy to help . When are you coming home ? ”
48117	48137	47866	47866	he	418	“ Not sure yet . I ’ve got one more thing to do , then I ’ll head back . ”
48138	48145	47938	47938	His	418	“ I ’ll see you then . ”
48160	48169	48170	48170	he	73	“ That ’s her office across the street , ”
48288	48325	48281	48282	Her assistant	946	“ Hi , Eva . I had you on my list to call , but your friend beat me to it . I ’ve been trying to reach you for a few days now , actually . ”

48337	48378	48281	48282	Her assistant	946	“ No problem . I saw the pictures of you and Cross at the beach . I do n’t blame you for not calling back . We do need to get together , though , and nail down some details . ”
48379	48388	48281	48282	Her assistant	946	“ September twenty - second is the date . ”
48394	48399	48281	48282	Her assistant	946	“ Okay . Wow . ”
48431	48481	48281	48282	Her assistant	946	“ I ’ve decided my mom ’s right about the white , cream , and gold palette , so let ’s run with that . I ’d like small accents of red . For example , I ’ll have a neutral bouquet , but my jewelry will be rubies . ”
48482	48513	48514	48514	She	345	“ Ooh . Let me think . Maybe red damask skirts beneath white tablecloths … ? Or Murano glass chargers under crystal plates … I ’ll pull together some options . ”
48520	48529	48514	48514	She	345	“ I really have to see the location . ”
48530	48544	48514	48514	She	345	“ I can arrange for a flight down . When can you go ? ”
48545	48551	48552	48552	Kristen	436	“ As soon as possible , ”
48556	48570	48552	48552	Kristen	436	“ I ’m tied up tomorrow evening , but the morning would work . ”

48584	48602	48552	48552	Kristen	436	“ I ’ll keep an eye out for it . Eva … do you have your dress ? ”
48603	48608	48514	48514	She	345	“ Uh … no . ”
48626	48658	48613	48613	she	345	“ I completely understand wanting to hurry things along with a man like yours , but more time would help make sure everything runs smoothly and you have your perfect day . ”
48659	48671	48672	48672	I	0	“ It ’ll be perfect no matter what might go wrong . ”
48692	48699	48672	48672	I	0	“ It ’s Gideon ’s birthday . ”
48700	48713	48613	48613	she	345	“ Whew . Okay , then . We ’ll make it happen . ”
48718	48727	48714	48714	My	0	“ Thank you . Talk to you soon . ”
48842	48847	48848	48848	I	0	“ Hi , Blaire , ”
48855	48866	48848	48848	I	0	“ It ’s Eva Tramell , Gideon Cross ’s fiancée . ”
48867	48878	48879	48879	His	418	“ Eva . Of course I know who you are . ”
48886	48895	48879	48879	His	418	“ It ’s good to hear from you . ”
48896	48918	48879	48879	His	418	“ I ’d like to go over some of the design details with you . Cary said you can meet tomorrow ? ”
48919	48928	48879	48879	His	418	“ Sure . What time works for you ? ”
48943	48953	48940	48940	I	0	“ Would evening work ? Say six - ish ? ”
48989	48995	48996	48996	Blair	2356	“ That works for me , ”
48999	49008	48996	48996	Blair	2356	“ I ’ll meet you at the penthouse ? ”
49009	49022	49025	49025	I	0	“ Yes , I ’ll see you there . Thanks . Bye . ”

49634	49677	49620	49620	I	0	“ I do n’t have any worries about him . You , however , should be worried about me . Because if you come near him or Cary again , you ’ll be dealing with me . It wo n’t be pleasant . ”

49733	49807	49730	49730	She	166	“ He ’s been broken from birth . He ’s sick and twisted in ways he has n’t shown you yet . He ’s thinking he can hide it from you , his pretty little girl who creates just the right fairy tale . Beauty and the beast for the masses . A clever cover - up , but it wo n’t hold . He ca n’t suppress his true nature for long . ”
49864	49893	49854	49854	Her	166	“ Gideon is vicious and cruel at his core . He ’ll break you before he ’s done with you . If he does n’t kill you first . ”

52454	52485	52514	52514	Her	2431	“ Tasty . I wish Tatiana were n’t pregnant , but I think it ’s making Cary reevaluate and grow up a little bit . That ’s a good thing . ”

55639	55696	55602	55602	Her	2431	“ She hurt you . She ’s still hurting you . It ’s a natural animal instinct to want to see her wounded , too . But I think what you ’re glad about is having a … champion . Someone who ’s telling her it really did happen to you and it ’s not okay . ”
55712	55722	55723	55723	she	2357	“ Do you want me to come back over ? ”

55964	55977	55951	55951	Eva	2431	“ Ca n’t blame him . You ’re extremely , lickably delicious . ”
55978	55987	55959	55959	her	2431	“ Bring your tongue over here , then . ”
56149	56157	56158	56158	she	2431	“ I ’m glad you called me , ”

56231	56246	56247	56247	I	0	“ You ’re not planning any more ambushes on enemies today , are you ? ”
56250	56253	56254	56254	She	2431	“ No . ”
56275	56287	56254	56254	She	2431	“ But I ’m ready if someone decides to ambush me . ”
56337	56347	56326	56326	She	2431	“ I was n’t talking about you , ace . ”
56348	56354	56355	56355	I	0	“ I ’m not someone ? ”
56417	56420	56421	56421	she	2431	“ No , ”

56598	56612	56579	56579	I	0	“ Listen , Lucky . You ’re not living up to your name . ”
56616	56629	56613	56613	Eva	2431	“ He ’s helping you live up to your promise to behave . ”
56648	56659	56630	56630	I	0	“ Which had the caveat that you behave as well . ”
56775	56781	56782	56782	Eva	2431	“ He really loves you . ”
56966	56969	56970	56970	She	331	“ Gideon . ”
56974	56980	56970	56970	She	331	“ I suppose you heard ? ”
56981	56988	56989	56989	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m sorry . ”
56996	57007	56989	56989	I	0	“ If you need anything , please let me know . ”
57008	57022	57023	57023	she	331	“ Chris is the one who suddenly is n’t happy in our marriage , ”
57027	57038	57023	57023	she	331	“ And it ’s all my fault , of course . ”
57048	57066	57039	57039	I	0	“ Not to be insensitive , but the details do n’t concern me . How are you ? ”
57067	57072	57078	57078	Her	331	“ Talk to him . ”
57082	57091	57078	57078	Her	331	“ Tell him he ’s made a mistake . ”
57127	57149	57122	57122	I	0	“ You wo n’t want my advice , but I ’ll offer it anyway . You might want to consider therapy . ”
57155	57170	57122	57122	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you , of all people , would suggest that . ”
57171	57177	57178	57178	My	0	“ Preaching what I practice . ”
57197	57246	57178	57178	My	0	“ Eva suggested couples counseling shortly after we began dating . She wanted something more out of our relationship . I wanted her , so I agreed . Initially , I was just going through the motions , but now I can say it ’s been really worthwhile . ”
57247	57254	57255	57255	she	2357	“ She started all of this , ”
57258	57278	57255	57255	she	2357	“ You ’re such a smart man , Gideon , but you ca n’t see what she ’s doing . ”
57279	57292	57293	57293	I	0	“ And this is where I say good - bye , Mother , ”
57301	57308	57293	57293	I	0	“ Call if you need anything . ”
57499	57505	57506	57506	he	1058	“ What do you want ? ”
57557	57568	57543	57543	His	1060	“ The pleasure of hearing your voice . What else ? ”
57569	57590	57543	57543	His	1060	“ Cut the shit , Gideon . Did you call to gloat ? Your fondest wish has finally come true . ”
57604	57648	57597	57597	I	0	“ I ’d tell you I ’m very sorry your parents are divorcing , but you would n’t believe me , so I wo n’t bother . Instead , I ’ll say that I ’m here for you , if you need me . ”
57649	57654	57655	57655	He	1060	“ Go to hell . ”
57866	57875	57876	57876	he	0	“ How did your weekend in Westport go ? ”
57879	57885	57902	57902	she	2431	“ Did she call you ? ”
57940	57943	57944	57944	He	0	“ No . ”
57955	57965	57944	57944	He	0	“ I saw the photographs of you and Eva . ”
57970	57985	57968	57968	me	0	“ I would n’t have taken you for the type to follow the tabloids . ”
57986	58016	57944	57944	He	0	“ My wife does . She showed me the pictures because she found them very romantic . I have to agree with her . You both looked very happy . ”
58017	58021	57968	57968	me	0	“ We are . ”
58022	58033	57944	57944	He	0	“ How do you get along with Eva ’s family ? ”
58045	58061	58034	58034	I	0	“ I ’ve known Richard Stanton for many years and Monica for the last few . ”
58062	58075	57968	57968	me	0	“ Casual and business acquaintances are very different from in - laws . ”
58086	58101	58082	58082	I	0	“ It was … awkward . Unnecessarily so , but I dealt with it . ”
58108	58116	58102	58103	Dr. Petersen	0	“ How did you deal with it ? ”
58117	58123	58141	58141	He	0	“ I focused on Eva . ”
58124	58133	58102	58103	Dr. Petersen	0	“ So you maintained distance from the others ? ”
58134	58140	58141	58141	He	0	“ No more than usual . ”
58148	58159	58141	58141	He	0	“ Anything else happen since I saw you on Thursday ? ”
58165	58175	58160	58160	My	0	“ She bought me a dog . A puppy . ”
58182	58185	58176	58176	He	0	“ Congratulations . ”
58189	58198	58186	58186	I	0	“ Eva ’s tickled by the whole thing . ”
58199	58207	58186	58186	I	0	“ Is it her dog , then ? ”
58208	58223	58186	58186	I	0	“ No . She got all the gear and dropped him in my lap . ”
58224	58231	58186	58186	I	0	“ That ’s quite a commitment . ”
58232	58246	58186	58186	I	0	“ He ’ll be fine . Animals are good at self - sufficiency . ”
58258	58265	58186	58186	I	0	“ My stepfather filed for divorce . ”
58278	58322	58274	58274	he	0	“ We ’ve gone from in - laws , to a new dog , to the dissolution of your parents ’ marriage in the space of a few minutes . That ’s a tremendous amount of change for someone who strives for structure . ”
58336	58352	58330	58330	I	0	“ You seem remarkably composed , Gideon . Because things are going well with Eva ? ”
58353	58357	58358	58358	I	0	“ Exceptionally well . ”
58436	58456	58432	58432	He	1066	“ Of the three things you mentioned , how would you rank them from most important to least important ? ”
58457	58467	58509	58509	He	1066	“ That would depend on your definition of importance . ”
58468	58480	58432	58432	He	1066	“ Fair enough . Which would you say impacts you most ? ”
58481	58485	58509	58509	He	1066	“ The dog . ”
58486	58495	58432	58432	He	1066	“ Does he or she have a name ? ”
58502	58508	58496	58496	I	0	“ His name is Lucky . ”
58517	58525	58509	58509	He	1066	“ Would you buy Eva a pet ? ”
58540	58543	58532	58532	I	0	“ No . ”
58544	58548	58432	58432	He	1066	“ Why not ? ”
58555	58566	58549	58549	I	0	“ As you pointed out , it ’s a commitment . ”
58567	58580	58532	58532	I	0	“ Are you resentful that she made you take on that commitment ? ”
58581	58584	58549	58549	I	0	“ No . ”
58585	58594	58532	58532	I	0	“ Do you have any pictures of Lucky ? ”
58598	58608	58595	58595	I	0	“ No . Where are you going with this ? ”
58609	58615	58616	58616	He	1066	“ I ’m not sure . ”
58626	58633	58616	58616	He	1066	“ Bear with me a minute . ”
58634	58637	58549	58549	I	0	“ Okay . ”
58638	58678	58616	58616	He	1066	“ Taking on a pet is a big responsibility , similar to adopting a child . They ’re dependent on you for food and shelter , for companionship and love . Dogs more so than cats or other animals . ”
58679	58686	58687	58687	I	0	“ So I ’ve been told , ”
58691	58755	58687	58687	I	0	“ You have the family you were born into and the family you ’ve married into , but you keep yourself separate from both . Their activities and overtures do n’t impact you in a meaningful way because you do n’t allow them to . They ’re disruptive to the order of your life , so you keep them at a comfortable distance . ”
58756	58781	58827	58827	her	1067	“ I do n’t see anything wrong with that . I ’m certainly not the only person to say family is who you choose . ”
58782	58792	58687	58687	I	0	“ Who have you chosen , aside from Eva ? ”
58793	58801	58827	58827	her	1067	“ It … was n’t a choice . ”
58869	58883	58884	58885	Dr. Petersen	0	“ My concern is that she ’s become a coping mechanism for you , ”
58888	58927	58884	58885	Dr. Petersen	0	“ You ’ve found someone who loves you and believes you , who supports you and gives you strength . In many ways , you feel like she ’s the only one who will ever truly understand you . ”
58928	58939	58884	58885	Dr. Petersen	0	“ She ’s in a unique position to do so . ”
58940	58945	58946	58946	he	0	“ Not that unique , ”
58950	58969	58946	58946	he	0	“ I ’ve read the transcripts of some of your speeches . You ’re aware of the statistics . ”
59009	59027	58998	58998	them	1070	“ If there ’s a point , Doctor , I ’d like you to get to it . ”
59028	59099	59100	59100	I	0	“ I want you to be mindful of a potential tendency to seclude yourself with Eva , to the exclusion of everyone else . I asked if you would gift her with a pet , because I ca n’t see you doing so . That would shift her focus and affection away from you , even if only slightly , while your focus and affection is centered entirely on her . ”
59111	59119	59100	59100	I	0	“ That ’s not unusual for newlyweds . ”
59120	59127	59128	59128	He	0	“ It ’s unusual for you . ”
59132	59143	59128	59128	He	0	“ Did Eva say why she gave Lucky to you ? ”
59156	59166	59144	59144	I	0	“ She wants me to have more unconditional love . ”
59170	59250	59167	59167	He	0	“ And I ’m certain it will give her great pleasure to see you reciprocating that . She ’s pushed very hard for you to open up to her and to me . Now that you ’re taking those steps , she ’ll want you to open up to others . The bigger her intimate circle is , the happier she is . She wants to pull you into that , not have you pull her out of it . ”
59308	59316	59297	59297	I	0	“ When I told you about Hugh … ”
59324	59327	59317	59317	He	0	“ Yes ? ”
59328	59335	59317	59317	He	0	“ You did n’t seem surprised . ”
59336	59344	59345	59345	His	0	“ And you want to know why . ”
59350	59371	59345	59345	His	0	“ There were certain markers . I could say I deduced it , but that would n’t be entirely true . ”
59412	59424	59425	59425	he	0	“ I saw Eva shortly after she moved to New York , ”
59429	59480	59425	59425	he	0	“ She asked me if it was possible for two abuse survivors to have a meaningful relationship . It was only a few days later when you contacted me and asked if I ’d be open to seeing you , in addition to seeing you and Eva as a couple . ”
59485	59507	59425	59425	he	0	“ I had n’t told her then . I did n’t until we ’d been coming to you for a while . ”
59537	59541	59532	59532	I	0	“ Excuse me . ”
59583	59592	59580	59580	I	0	“ I ’ll have to cut this short , ”
59609	59615	59598	59598	He	0	“ Is everything all right ? ”
59616	59631	59632	59632	I	0	“ If not , I ’m sure you ’ll hear about it on Thursday . ”
59667	59677	59655	59655	Angus	73	“ The police are at the penthouse with Eva . ”
59697	59700	59690	59690	Angus	73	“ Why ? ”
59701	59709	59655	59655	Angus	73	“ Anne Lucas filed charges of harassment . ”
60040	60054	60055	60056	Officer Peña	188	“ You do n’t have to go to any trouble , Ms. Tramell , ”
60157	60163	60164	60164	I	0	“ It ’s no trouble . ”
60187	60213	60164	60164	I	0	“ And I ’m waiting for my attorney to arrive , so there ’s really not much else for me to do in the meantime . ”
60255	60278	60222	60222	she	1097	“ My dad ’s on the job in California . He ’d chew me out if I did n’t follow his advice . ”
60307	60312	60313	60313	Peña	188	“ Where in California ? ”
60325	60328	60389	60389	She	1101	“ Oceanside . ”
60329	60338	60367	60367	she	1101	“ San Diego area , right ? Nice . ”
60339	60345	60389	60389	She	1101	“ It is , yes . ”
60374	60380	60367	60367	she	1101	“ Is Mr. Cross here ? ”
60381	60388	60389	60389	She	1101	“ He ’s in a meeting . ”
60404	60415	60389	60389	She	1101	“ Who was the guy leaving when we came up ? ”
60447	60464	60432	60432	I	0	“ Blaire Ash . He ’s the interior designer working on some renovations we ’re doing . ”
60465	60470	60471	60471	Peña	188	“ You live here ? ”
60474	60490	60471	60471	Peña	188	“ We stopped by an apartment on the Upper West Side we heard was yours . ”
60491	60501	60432	60432	I	0	“ I ’m in the process of moving in . ”
60511	60515	60502	60502	He	188	“ Nice place . ”
60516	60523	60471	60471	Peña	188	“ I think so , too . ”
60529	60538	60524	60524	Williams	187	“ Have you been dating Gideon Cross long ? ”
60539	60548	60549	60549	Gideon	418	“ She ’s married to me , actually , ”
60735	60739	60740	60740	he	418	“ Gideon Cross , ”
60750	60760	60740	60740	he	418	“ And this is our counsel , Arash Madani . ”
60874	60883	60859	60859	I	0	“ Would you like some black coffee instead ? ”
60899	60905	60884	60884	His	317	“ I ’d love some . ”
60906	60918	60919	60919	Peña	188	“ It ’s good that you ’re here , Mr. Cross , ”
60922	60932	60919	60919	Peña	188	“ Dr. Lucas also filed a complaint against you . ”
60936	60943	60944	60944	Arash	116	“ Well , that was fun , ”
60973	60989	60959	60959	Gideon	418	“ If that ’s your idea of entertainment , you need to get out more . ”
60990	61015	61016	61016	Arash	116	“ I was planning on doing that tonight — with a very hot blonde , I might add — until I got your call . ”
61041	61047	61028	61028	I	0	“ Thank you , Arash . ”
61048	61054	60959	60959	Gideon	418	“ You ’re most welcome . ”
61055	61084	61028	61028	I	0	“ I bet you do n’t step into courtrooms all that often , but I want to be there the next time you do . You ’re awesome . ”
61088	61098	61085	61085	He	418	“ I ’ll be sure to let you know . ”
61099	61109	61110	61110	Gideon	418	“ Do n’t thank him for doing his job , ”
61123	61134	61135	61135	I	0	“ I ’m thanking him for doing his job well , ”
61190	61209	61185	61185	Gideon	418	“ What the hell do you think I ’m paying him so much to do ? Fuck up ? ”
61210	61217	61218	61218	I	0	“ Dial it back , ace , ”
61222	61245	61218	61218	I	0	“ Do n’t let that bitch get to you . And do n’t take that tone with me . Or your friend . ”
61251	61263	61246	61246	Arash	116	“ I think he ’s jealous you like me so much . ”
61264	61267	61269	61269	I	0	“ Ha ! ”
61283	61286	61273	61273	Gideon	418	“ Seriously ? ”
61287	61299	61300	61301	my husband	839	“ Get back on topic . How are you fixing this ? ”
61316	61323	61324	61324	Arash	116	“ Fixing your fuck - up ? ”
61335	61391	61324	61324	Arash	116	“ You both provided Anne Lucas the ammunition for this by going to her place of employment on two separate occasions . You ’re damned lucky she embellished her story with a little assault accusation against Eva . If she ’d just stuck with the truth , she ’d have you both by the throats . ”
61529	61578	61522	61522	Gideon	418	“ The district attorney may or may not decide to go after her for falsely reporting an incident , but she damaged her credibility by accusing Eva of putting hands on her when security footage proves otherwise . Very fortunate , you having that , by the way . ”
61621	61630	61631	61631	Arash	116	“ It should n’t have to be said , ”
61635	61646	61631	61631	Arash	116	“ but when confronted by crazy , Do Not Engage . ”
61678	61736	61668	61669	The attorney	1112	“ I ’ll work on getting her erroneous assault complaint dismissed and see if I can leverage it to our advantage by filing a counterclaim of harassment . I ’ll also try for protection orders for both of you and Cary Taylor , but regardless , you all need to stay far , far away from her . ”
61737	61740	61741	61741	I	0	“ Absolutely , ”
61905	61912	61913	61913	I	0	“ You ’ll stay for dinner ? ”
61917	61938	61913	61913	I	0	“ No idea what I ’m making yet , but we ruined your plans and I feel bad about that . ”
61939	61945	61946	61946	Gideon	418	“ It ’s still early . ”

68635	68649	68650	68650	he	118	“ You ’ll have to take that up with her and her friends , ”
68654	68665	68650	68650	he	118	“ As for us , we are going to Rio . ”
68692	68704	68705	68705	he	118	“ I ’m going to ask Scott to arrange the flight , ”
68708	68734	68705	68705	he	118	“ We ’ll leave Friday evening and plan to return Monday in time for you to go to work , if you are ambitious enough . ”
68735	68741	68674	68674	Eva	2431	“ Where is Eva going ? ”
68742	68792	68705	68705	he	118	“ I have no idea . Shawna would n’t say , because it ’s not for you to know . She told me only that they would be gone for the weekend and I should plan on keeping you occupied , because Cary does n’t want you to interfere . ”
68793	68802	68803	68803	I	0	“ That ’s not his decision to make , ”
68809	68839	68806	68806	He	118	“ Being angry at me wo n’t help you , Gideon . And if you do n’t trust her , my friend , you should n’t be marrying her . ”
68847	68879	68840	68840	My	0	“ Arnoldo , you ’re the closest friend I have . But that ’ll change if you do n’t get your head out of your ass when it comes to Eva . ”
68880	68885	68886	68886	he	0	“ You mistake me , ”
68890	68919	68886	68886	he	0	“ If you cage her for your own security , you will lose her . What is considered romantic in a boyfriend can be stifling in a husband . ”
68938	68945	68932	68932	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe this . ”
68946	68981	68990	68990	Arnoldo	118	“ Do n’t get me wrong . Arash assures me she is the best thing to ever happen to you . He says he has never seen you happier and that she adores you . ”
68982	68989	68932	68932	I	0	“ I ’ve said the same . ”
68994	69005	68990	68990	Arnoldo	118	“ Men in love do not make the best witnesses . ”
69010	69021	68990	68990	Arnoldo	118	“ Why are you and Arash discussing my personal life ? ”
69022	69029	68990	68990	Arnoldo	118	“ It is what friends do . ”
69030	69049	69050	69050	I	0	“ Girlfriends . You ’re grown men . You should have something better to do with your time . ”
69058	69076	69050	69050	I	0	“ And you want me to spend a weekend in Brazil with a bunch of guy gossips ? ”
69077	69080	69081	69081	His	118	“ Listen . ”
69087	69114	69081	69081	His	118	“ Manhattan is out . I love the city , too , but I think we ’ve exhausted its charms . Especially for such an occasion . ”
69142	69146	69148	69148	she	2431	“ fuck pad , ”
69220	69229	69230	69230	I	0	“ All right . I wo n’t argue . ”
69250	69269	69230	69230	I	0	“ Excellent . I will let you get back to work . We can catch up this weekend . ”
69308	69313	69314	69314	she	2431	“ Hey , ace , ”
69459	69468	69469	69469	I	0	“ Have our plans for the weekend changed ? ”
69472	69479	69480	69480	she	2431	“ I might increase my vitamins , ”
69483	69497	69480	69480	she	2431	“ but otherwise , no . I ’m really looking forward to it . ”
69506	69528	69501	69501	her	2431	“ I ’ve been told our friends plan to keep us apart this weekend for our respective bachelor and bachelorette parties . ”
69529	69532	69480	69480	she	2431	“ Oh . ”
69538	69548	69480	69480	she	2431	“ I was kinda hoping everyone forgot about that . ”
69561	69573	69555	69555	I	0	“ We could run away where they ca n’t find us . ”
69574	69578	69579	69579	She	2431	“ I wish . ”
69582	69613	69579	69579	She	2431	“ I think these things are more for them than us . It ’s their last chance to have us all to themselves in the way they ’re used to . ”
69614	69624	69628	69628	they	1184	“ Those days were over when I met you . ”
69652	69665	69666	69666	she	2431	“ It ’s an odd sort of ritual , is n’t it ? ”
69669	69699	69666	69666	she	2431	“ Two people commit to each other for life and their friends take them out , get them drunk , and encourage them to be bad one last time . ”
69736	69744	69731	69731	she	2431	“ We ’ll discuss this more tonight . ”
69745	69748	69749	69749	she	2431	“ Yay , ”
69786	69793	69794	69794	Her	2431	“ I love you , Eva . ”
69798	69805	69794	69794	Her	2431	“ I love you , too . ”
69836	69841	69842	69842	he	348	“ What ’s up ? ”
69845	69857	69834	69834	Cary	348	“ Where are you planning on taking my wife this weekend ? ”
69874	69882	69863	69863	I	0	“ You do n’t need to know . ”
69883	69890	69834	69834	Cary	348	“ The hell I do n’t . ”
69891	69902	69903	69903	Cary	348	“ I ’m not going to have you controlling her , ”
69907	69941	69903	69903	Cary	348	“ with guards cockblocking any dude that comes near her , like you did in Vegas . She ’s a big girl . She can handle herself and she deserves to have fun . ”
69950	69959	69903	69903	Cary	348	“ There were extenuating circumstances then , Cary . ”
69960	69963	69968	69968	his	348	“ Really ? ”
69971	69975	69968	69968	his	348	“ Like what ? ”
69976	70004	69903	69903	Cary	348	“ Nathan Barker was still breathing and you ’d just had a goddamned orgy in your living room . I could n’t trust her safety to you . ”
70022	70033	70011	70011	he	348	“ Clancy ’s covering security . She ’ll be fine . ”
70156	70169	70149	70149	My	0	“ Eva needs her friends and I want her to enjoy herself . ”
70170	70173	70174	70174	he	82	“ Great , ”
70178	70182	70174	70174	he	82	“ We agree . ”
70183	70241	70149	70149	My	0	“ I wo n’t interfere , Cary , but keep in mind that no one ’s as invested in keeping her safe as I am . She ’s only part of your life . She is my life . Do n’t be too stubborn to reach out to me if you need me . Is that clear ? ”
70242	70249	70174	70174	he	82	“ Yeah . I get it . ”
70250	70264	70149	70149	My	0	“ If it helps you feel better , I ’ll be in Brazil . ”
70271	70290	70265	70265	He	82	“ I have n’t nailed down where we ’re going yet , but I ’m leaning toward Ibiza . ”
70358	70366	70355	70355	I	0	“ Let me know what you decide . ”
70367	70370	70355	70355	I	0	“ Okay . ”
70519	70535	70536	70536	I	0	“ There ’d better be a good reason why you ’re making yourself at home , ”
70551	70555	70545	70545	He	1191	“ Deanna Johnson . ”
70567	70572	70556	70556	My	0	“ What about her ? ”
70576	70582	70573	70573	Arash	116	“ You do know her . ”
70583	70590	70591	70591	I	0	“ She ’s a freelance journalist . ”
70631	70643	70573	70573	Arash	116	“ Okay . The hot blonde I bailed on last night ? ”
70651	70657	70644	70644	I	0	“ Get on with it . ”
70658	70687	70573	70573	Arash	116	“ She works in the legal department of the publishing house that acquired the rights to Corinne ’s book . She told me the ghostwriter is Deanna Johnson . ”
70705	70709	70688	70688	I	0	“ Damn it . ”
70723	70731	70732	70732	Arash	116	“ Let me take a wild guess , ”
70735	70745	70732	70732	Arash	116	“ You know Ms. Johnson in the biblical sense . ”
70834	70861	70818	70819	My friend	514	“ Now I see why you were in such a rush to get a ring on Eva . Seal the deal before she runs away screaming . ”
70899	70915	70916	70916	I	0	“ Well , that ’s a nice bit of news to wrap up the day , ”
70919	70923	70916	70916	I	0	“ What is ? ”
70997	71000	71001	71001	Arash	116	“ Eva . ”
71005	71008	71009	71009	She	2431	“ Hey . ”
71032	71037	71015	71015	she	2431	“ Hi , ace . ”
71047	71058	71039	71039	she	2431	“ What ’s wrong ? Is it a bad time ? ”
71092	71105	71059	71059	I	0	“ Never , angel . You come to me whenever you want . ”
71110	71146	71106	71106	Her	2431	“ Megumi and I are going to hit the gym together , but I ’m early , so figured I ’d drop in on you . Grab a glimpse of your hotness to motivate me . ”
71155	71162	71163	71163	I	0	“ Do n’t wear yourself out , ”
71166	71172	71163	71163	I	0	“ That ’s my job . ”
71184	71192	71181	71181	I	0	“ Seriously . What ’s the matter ? ”
71203	71212	71193	71193	Arash	116	“ I ’ll head back to my office . ”
71221	71229	71213	71213	I	0	“ Deanna is ghostwriting Corinne ’s book . ”
71233	71238	71230	71230	Eva	2431	“ Is that so ? ”
71239	71245	71246	71246	Arash	116	“ She knows about Deanna ? ”
71263	71269	71255	71256	My wife	2357	“ Do you know Deanna ? ”
71276	71289	71270	71270	He	2357	“ Never met her . Never even heard of her before today . ”
71302	71307	71296	71296	Eva	2431	“ I told you . ”
71308	71312	71329	71329	She	2431	“ I know . ”
71313	71318	71319	71319	Arash	116	“ Told him what ? ”
71341	71386	71329	71329	She	2431	“ That she could n’t be trusted . She ’s butthurt because he got her naked , then blew her off . Not that I blame her . I ’d be totally humiliated if I showed the goods but could n’t make the sale . ”
71395	71403	71387	71387	Arash	116	“ You have performance problems , Cross ? ”
71404	71414	71415	71415	I	0	“ You have your eye on unemployment , Madani ? ”
71421	71435	71436	71436	Eva	2431	“ She ’d already played hide - the - salami with Gideon once , ”
71440	71466	71436	71436	Eva	2431	“ And she really liked the salami . Ca n’t blame her there , either . I told you what a great lay he is . ”
71475	71481	71467	71467	Arash	116	“ You did , yes . ”
71482	71497	71467	71467	Arash	116	“ Blows the top of your head right off . Your toes curl and — ”
71498	71506	71507	71507	I	0	“ For fuck ’s sake , Eva , ”
71516	71568	71510	71510	She	2431	“ Just trying to give some context , baby . And give credit where it ’s due . Anyway , poor Deanna is torn between hating his guts and wanting to bang him like a drum . Since she ca n’t do the latter , she ’s stuck with the former . ”
71574	71579	71569	71569	I	0	“ Are you done ? ”
71599	71609	71610	71610	he	116	“ Props for laying that all out for her , ”
71615	71638	71595	71595	Arash	116	“ You ’re a saint , Eva , for putting up with him and the trail of scorned women in his wake . ”
71639	71645	71646	71646	Her	2357	“ What can I say ? ”
71650	71658	71646	71646	Her	2357	“ How ’d you guys find out ? ”
71659	71671	71595	71595	Arash	116	“ I ’ve got an inside connection at the publishing house . ”
71672	71682	71646	71646	Her	2357	“ Oh . I thought maybe Deanna said something . ”
71683	71717	71595	71595	Arash	116	“ She wo n’t . They do n’t want it known that Corinne is n’t writing the book , so they ’ve got a confidentiality clause . They ’re negotiating the contract now . ”
71751	71760	71742	71742	she	2431	“ Off I go . Megumi ’s ready . ”
71803	71812	71813	71813	She	2431	“ You ’re so lucky I came along . ”
71820	71840	71813	71813	She	2431	“ Think of how much more trouble you would ’ve gotten into if you ’d stayed single any longer . ”
71841	71850	71851	71851	She	2431	“ You ’re trouble enough for a lifetime . ”
71886	71892	71893	71893	Arash	116	“ She got any sisters ? ”
71903	71913	71893	71893	Arash	116	“ No , she ’s one of a kind . ”
71914	71919	71920	71920	Eva	2431	“ Hey , wait , ”
71942	71955	71938	71938	She	2431	“ If they ’re negotiating , nothing ’s been signed , right ? ”
71956	71959	71960	71960	Arash	116	“ Right , ”
71968	71977	71963	71963	She	2431	“ You can get her not to sign . ”
71982	71991	71963	71963	She	2431	“ How am I supposed to do that ? ”
71992	71998	71963	71963	She	2431	“ Offer her a job . ”
72007	72010	71999	71999	I	0	“ No . ”
72011	72017	71963	71963	She	2431	“ Do n’t say no . ”
72018	72021	72022	72022	I	0	“ No , ”
72031	72049	72025	72026	My wife	2357	“ Your employee agreements include things like nondisclosure , nondisparagement , noncompetes , et cetera , right ? ”
72056	72087	72050	72050	Arash	116	“ I see where you ’re going , and yes , they do . But there are limitations as to what those clauses cover and how they can be enforced . ”
72088	72105	72106	72106	Her	2357	“ Better than nothing , though , maybe ? Keep your enemies close and all that . ”
72113	72124	72175	72175	She	2357	“ Do n’t look at me like that , Eva . ”
72125	72139	72140	72140	She	2357	“ Okay . It ’s just an idea . I have to go . ”
72211	72220	72221	72221	I	0	“ You do n’t want that book published , ”
72244	72251	72234	72234	She	2431	“ No , I do n’t . ”
72274	72290	72262	72262	She	2431	“ You know she ’d expect me to offer her more than just a job . ”
72291	72299	72300	72300	she	2431	“ You ’d have to entice her , ”
72307	72360	72300	72300	she	2431	“ You ’re a juicy carrot , Cross . And you know how to dangle out of reach without even trying . She just needs to sign on the dotted line . Afterward , you can transfer her to Siberia as long as you give her work that fits the job description . ”
72401	72413	72397	72397	I	0	“ You ’re whoring me out to get what you want . ”
72414	72419	72420	72420	Arash	116	“ Jesus , Cross , ”
72423	72430	72420	72420	Arash	116	“ Do n’t be an ass . ”
72445	72496	72431	72431	Eva	2431	“ Bullshit . You ’d have to lead her on , not fuck her . I want that book published as much as you want to hear ‘ Golden Girl ’ on repeat , but you ’re living with the damn song and I can live with the damn book . ”
72497	72505	72506	72506	I	0	“ Then why bring up hiring her ? ”
72515	72535	72506	72506	I	0	“ I do n’t want that fucking woman within a mile of me , let alone working for me . ”
72536	72565	72431	72431	Eva	2431	“ Fine . It was just a suggestion . I could tell you were upset about it when I got here and I do n’t like you upset — ”
72566	72578	72506	72506	I	0	“ For Christ ’s sake , I do n’t get upset ! ”
72579	72582	72583	72583	she	2431	“ Right , ”
72586	72611	72583	72583	she	2431	“ Of course not . You like bad - tempered better ? Sullen ? Moody ? Are those more masculine for you , ace ? ”
72612	72621	72506	72506	I	0	“ I should take you over my knee . ”
72622	72633	72634	72634	she	2431	“ Try it and I ’ll split your sexy lip , ”
72643	72688	72634	72634	she	2431	“ You think I like the idea of you getting that bitch hot and bothered ? Just imagining you flirting with her , giving her the idea you ’d like to screw her , makes me want to break stuff — including her face . ”
72689	72692	72693	72693	I	0	“ Good . ”
72728	72739	72740	72740	she	2431	“ And maybe Deanna dropping out wo n’t change anything , ”
72747	72786	72740	72740	she	2431	“ The publisher could hire someone else to ghostwrite the fucking book . Hopefully someone unbiased , but hey , you ’ve got ex - lovers crawling out of the woodwork , so they might get lucky again . ”
72787	72794	72711	72711	She	2431	“ That ’s enough , Eva . ”
72795	72833	72740	72740	she	2431	“ I would n’t whore you out just to stop that book from being published . You ’re the fuck of the century . I could get a few grand an hour for you , at least . ”
72834	72838	72839	72839	I	0	“ Goddamn it ! ”
72851	72854	72855	72855	Arash	116	“ Whoa ! ”
72862	72882	72855	72855	Arash	116	“ As your attorney , I have to point out that pissing off your wife could cost you millions . ”
72883	72890	72891	72891	she	2431	“ He likes pissing women off , ”
72904	72910	72891	72891	she	2431	“ It turns him on . ”
72911	72920	72921	72921	I	0	“ Get out of the way , Madani , ”
72924	72932	72933	72933	she	2431	“ He ’s all yours , Arash , ”
73009	73016	73017	73017	I	0	“ Kiss me good - bye , ”
73020	73033	73035	73035	her	2431	“ You do n’t want my mouth anywhere near you right now ! ”
73127	73132	73133	73133	she	2431	“ You ’re crazy , ”
73136	73146	73133	73133	she	2431	“ What the hell is the matter with you ? ”

73171	73177	73166	73166	She	2431	“ I did kiss you . ”
73178	73189	73124	73124	her	2431	“ The first time . Not the second or third . ”
73190	73197	73198	73198	she	2431	“ Well , fuck me sideways , ”
73220	73228	73208	73208	she	2431	“ Why did n’t you just ask ? ”
73229	73235	73208	73208	she	2431	“ I wo n’t beg . ”
73236	73241	73242	73242	She	2431	“ You never do . ”
73247	73257	73242	73242	She	2431	“ You give orders . Do n’t stop now . ”
73258	73271	73272	73272	Megumi	89	“ The stuff you get away with when you ’re the boss , ”
73305	73317	73296	73296	Arash	116	“ Temporary insanity caused by prewedding jitters , right , Scott ? ”
73324	73336	73318	73318	He	514	“ Diminished capacity . An epic brain fart of some kind . ”
73344	73348	73337	73337	I	0	“ Shut up . ”
73349	73353	73354	73354	Eva	2431	“ Be nice . ”
73359	73369	73354	73354	Eva	2431	“ We ’re going to talk about this later . ”
73370	73376	73354	73354	Eva	2431	“ Your place or ours ? ”
73384	73387	73377	73377	She	2431	“ Ours . ”
73445	73450	73451	73451	I	0	“ Hello , Megumi . ”
73763	73769	73770	73770	he	158	“ I have some information , ”
73790	73801	73782	73782	I	0	“ We ’ll talk when we get to the penthouse . ”
73802	73809	73770	73770	he	158	“ Your office would be better . ”
73810	73814	73815	73815	I	0	“ All right . ”
73914	73919	73922	73922	him	73	“ Okay , okay . ”
73944	73954	73922	73922	him	73	“ It ’s nice to see you , too . ”
74370	74376	74377	74377	I	0	“ You ’re not retiring , ”
74388	74395	74377	74377	I	0	“ I wo n’t let you . ”
74409	74424	74396	74396	He	73	“ Ah , laddie . Ye’ll be stuck with me for a while yet . ”
74454	74457	74458	74458	I	0	“ Down , ”
74487	74500	74501	74501	he	73	“ You ’ll remember the dossier we compiled when you met Eva , ”
74517	74521	74514	74514	I	0	“ Of course . ”
74721	74732	74733	74733	Angus	73	“ We ’ve kept a lawyer on retainer in Austin , ”
74737	74752	74733	74733	Angus	73	“ to send us any reports of unusual activity with Harrison and Leah Tramell . ”
74807	74813	74801	74801	Eva	2431	“ What have they done ? ”
74814	74818	74819	74819	he	0	“ They died , ”
74827	74833	74819	74819	he	0	“ Nearly a month ago . ”
74839	74870	74836	74836	me	0	“ Eva does n’t know . We were just talking over the weekend about wedding invitations and they came up . I assume Monica does n’t keep tabs on them . ”
74871	74883	74884	74884	Angus	73	“ She wrote the obituary that appeared in the local paper . ”
75009	75018	75005	75005	I	0	“ Two grandchildren ? Eva has a sibling ? ”
75038	75051	75032	75032	Angus	73	“ That mention and the photo made me take a deeper look . ”
75067	75072	75062	75062	I	0	“ Who is that ? ”
75073	75083	75032	75032	Angus	73	“ That ’s Monica Tramell — now Monica Dieck . ”
75115	75121	75103	75103	she	2357	“ I do n’t understand . ”
75122	75156	75103	75103	she	2357	“ I have n’t yet figured out what Eva ’s mother ’s actual name is , but the real Monica Tramell had a brother named Jackson who was briefly married to Lauren Kittrie . ”
75157	75160	75161	75161	Eva	2431	“ Lauren . ”
75166	75174	75161	75161	Eva	2431	“ What do we know about her ? ”
75175	75190	75103	75103	she	2357	“ For now , nothing , but that ’ll change . We ’re looking . ”
75199	75215	75191	75191	I	0	“ Is it possible we ’ve confused the Tramells and looked at the wrong family ? ”
75216	75221	75161	75161	Eva	2431	“ No , lad . ”
75249	75267	75242	75243	Ardbeg Uigeadail	212	“ Stanton would ’ve checked out Monica — Eva ’s mother — thoroughly before he married her . ”
75268	75283	75284	75284	he	212	“ You did n’t find out about Eva ’s past until she told you , ”
75439	75453	75432	75432	he	212	“ Benjamin Clancy is damned good . He would n’t have missed this . ”
75454	75459	75460	75460	He	212	“ We missed it . ”
75468	75489	75460	75460	He	212	“ If the Tramells had n’t passed away , we still would n’t know . The background check was clean . ”
75490	75502	75503	75503	I	0	“ How can it be clean , for fuck ’s sake ? ”
75512	75569	75460	75460	He	212	“ Eva ’s mother used Monica ’s name , birthdate , and family history , but she never opened a line of credit , which is how most identity theft is discovered . The bank account she ’s using was established twenty - five years ago and is a business account with a separate tax ID . ”
75635	75643	75644	75644	he	73	“ There ’s no trail , lad , ”
75653	75659	75644	75644	he	73	“ No crumbs to follow . ”
75660	75668	75644	75644	he	73	“ What about the real Monica Tramell ? ”
75669	75683	75644	75644	he	73	“ Her husband manages everything . In that sense , she hardly exists . ”
75696	75706	75707	75707	I	0	“ Eva does n’t know about any of this , ”
75711	75718	75707	75707	I	0	“ She would ’ve told me . ”
75771	75776	75777	75777	Angus	73	“ Aye , Gideon , ”
75799	75818	75786	75786	He	73	“ She loves you . Deeper and truer than I ’ve ever seen a lass love a man . ”
75839	75862	75833	75833	he	158	“ I need to know more . Everything . I ca n’t bring information like this to Eva in bits and pieces . ”
75863	75869	75870	75870	he	158	“ You ’ll have it , ”
75874	75878	75917	75917	Cary	348	“ IT ’S … ”
75897	75916	75892	75892	I	0	“ It ’s pretty , but it ’s not … right . It ’s not the right one . ”
75949	75977	75934	75934	he	348	“ You ’re kidding . I hand you a one - of - a - kind wedding dress designed just for you and you blow it off ? ”
75978	75996	75917	75917	Cary	348	“ I do n’t want a strapless dress . And this has a high - low hemline — ”
75997	76003	76004	76004	he	348	“ That ’s a train , ”
76008	76027	75917	75917	Cary	348	“ Then why can I see the shoes ? You should n’t be able to see the shoes . ”
76028	76047	75917	75917	Cary	348	“ It ’s a five - minute sketch . You can tell him to make the front longer . ”
76105	76112	76113	76113	I	0	“ It ’s too … contemporary , ”
76116	76120	76113	76113	I	0	“ Too modern . ”
76121	76126	76127	76127	He	348	“ Uh , yeah . ”
76138	76146	76127	76127	He	348	“ That ’s what makes it cool . ”
76147	76171	76172	76172	I	0	“ It ’s trendy , Cary . When I have kids , they ’ll look at it and wonder what I was thinking . ”
76188	76201	76172	76172	I	0	“ I want something timeless . Like Grace Kelly or Jackie Kennedy . ”
76202	76207	76208	76208	He	348	“ Kids , huh ? ”
76218	76236	76208	76208	He	348	“ If you hurry up , we can push strollers through the park together and plan playdates . ”
76237	76245	76208	76208	He	348	“ Ha ! Maybe in ten years . ”
76363	76366	76367	76367	Cary	348	“ Yeah , ”
76371	76397	76367	76367	Cary	348	“ It ’ll take ten years — and immaculate conception — for you to get knocked up if you do n’t start nailing him again . ”
76398	76401	76402	76402	I	0	“ Ugh . ”
76408	76426	76402	76402	I	0	“ Not that it ’s any of your business , but I rocked his world last night . ”
76427	76431	76432	76432	He	348	“ Did you ? ”
76440	76446	76432	76432	He	348	“ That ’s my girl . ”
76450	76461	76447	76447	I	0	“ Going to rock it again when he gets home . ”
76462	76493	76402	76402	I	0	“ I ’m jealous . I ’m not getting any . Zip . Zero . Zilch . My palm ’s going to have a permanent indentation from my lonely dick . ”
76503	76520	76496	76496	I	0	“ It ’s good to take a break for a while . Puts things in perspective . ”
76521	76529	76530	76530	he	348	“ You barely made it a week , ”
76533	76547	76548	76548	I	0	“ Ten days , actually . Ten horrible , hellacious , horrendous days . ”
76553	76560	76496	76496	I	0	“ Right ? Sucks . Bad . ”
76561	76613	76614	76614	I	0	“ I would n’t want to go through it again , but I ’m glad we were able to take sex out of the equation for a little bit . Made us focus on talking things out and enjoying just hanging out . When we finally let loose , it was … ”
76619	76622	76614	76614	I	0	“ Explosive . ”
76623	76630	76496	76496	I	0	“ You ’re making me hard . ”
76634	76639	76631	76631	I	0	“ What does n’t ? ”
76647	76659	76640	76640	He	348	“ I will not be ashamed of my healthy sex drive . ”
76660	76684	76614	76614	I	0	“ Just be proud of yourself for taking some time to figure out where you ’re going . I ’m proud of you . ”
76685	76692	76693	76693	He	348	“ Aww , thanks , Mom . ”
76701	76712	76693	76693	He	348	“ You know … I could be lying to you . ”
76713	76746	76614	76614	I	0	“ Nope . If you were fucking around , you ’d want me to know about it , because then I ’d kick your ass , which is part of the fun . ”
76761	76771	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ What ’s going to be fun is Ibiza . ”
76772	76775	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ Ibiza ? ”
76786	76792	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ For my bachelorette party ? ”
76793	76796	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ Yep . ”
76811	76821	76804	76804	I	0	“ How long is this party supposed to last ? ”
76830	76834	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ The weekend . ”
76835	76852	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ Not that he gets a say , but Gideon ’s not going to like it . ”
76853	76877	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ I smoothed him out . He ’s antsy about security , but he ’s going to be busy himself , in Brazil . ”
76882	76885	76878	76878	I	0	“ Brazil ? ”
76886	76897	76822	76822	Cary	348	“ You ’re like a parrot tonight , repeating everything . ”
76970	76997	76962	76962	My	0	“ I know that look . You ’re getting twitchy just thinking about him surrounded by Brazilian bikinis and the hot - blooded women wearing them . ”
76998	77004	76962	76964	My best friend	418	“ Shut up , Cary . ”
77005	77030	76962	76962	My	0	“ He ’s got the right crew to hit it hard , too . Especially that Manuel character . He ’s a major player . ”
77185	77193	77182	77182	Cary	348	“ You look ready to murder someone . ”
77194	77199	77200	77200	I	0	“ You ’re closest , ”
77204	77230	77182	77182	Cary	348	“ You ca n’t kill me . Who else will pack just the right outfits for you to make Gideon as jealous as you are ? ”
77231	77243	77244	77244	Cary	348	“ Sounds like I came home at just the right time . ”
77326	77333	77334	77334	Cary	348	“ What have you got there ? ”
77431	77437	77426	77426	he	418	“ You taste like wine . ”
77438	77444	77426	77426	he	418	“ Would you like some ? ”
77445	77448	77426	77426	he	418	“ Absolutely . ”
77643	77646	77647	77647	I	0	“ Anyway , ”
77652	77690	77647	77647	I	0	“ I feel like I ’ll know it when I see it , but I ’m running out of time . I ’m trying not to panic about it . I just do n’t want to settle . ”
77712	77728	77705	77705	His	418	“ You could wear jeans , angel , and be the most beautiful bride ever . ”
77742	77750	77735	77735	I	0	“ Where in Brazil are you going ? ”
77759	77762	77751	77751	Gideon	418	“ Rio . ”
77763	77766	77767	77767	I	0	“ Oh . ”
77873	77882	77883	77883	he	418	“ I heard Cary say you ’re jealous , ”
77904	77917	77901	77901	his	418	“ Is that why you picked Brazil ? So I ’d suffer ? ”
77918	77921	77922	77922	His	418	“ Angel . ”
77939	77952	77953	77953	His	418	“ I had nothing to do with the selection of the destination . ”
77962	77971	77953	77953	His	418	“ But I ’m glad you ’ll suffer . ”
77972	77975	77976	77976	I	0	“ Sadist . ”
77994	78013	77982	77982	Gideon	418	“ After your suggestion about Deanna , I was beginning to think you were getting bored with me . ”
78014	78019	78037	78037	he	418	“ That ’s hysterical . ”
78020	78025	78026	78026	he	418	“ Not to me , ”
78051	78066	78037	78037	he	418	“ I told you I did n’t like the idea of you hiring her . ”
78067	78114	78037	78037	he	418	“ Not right away you did n’t . You recommended I seduce her like you ’d tell me to pick up a bottle of wine on the way home from work . At least when I mentioned Rio , you tensed up and sulked about it . ”
78115	78121	78037	78037	he	418	“ There ’s a difference — ”
78122	78168	78037	78037	he	418	“ Between actively seducing a woman I ’ve fucked before and agreeing to a bachelor party I did n’t plan ? Absolutely . And it makes no sense why you ’d be okay with the first one and have a problem with the second one . ”
78172	78204	78169	78169	I	0	“ Because one is a business transaction in a controlled environment . The other is a last hurrah for sport fucking in the one of the sexiest cities in the world ! ”
78205	78210	78211	78211	His	0	“ You know better . ”
78226	78234	78235	78235	I	0	“ I ’m not worried about you , ”
78238	78266	78235	78235	I	0	“ It ’s the women who ’ll want you . And your friends , who ’ll get drunk and horny and want you to play , too . ”
78276	78291	78267	78267	His	0	“ And you think I ’m not strong enough to handle the peer pressure ? ”
78292	78307	78267	78267	His	0	“ I did n’t say that . Do n’t put words in my mouth . ”
78308	78319	78267	78267	His	0	“ I ’m just trying to clarify your convoluted thinking . ”
78320	78332	78333	78333	I	0	“ Look . Let ’s get back to the Deanna scenario . ”
78352	78406	78344	78344	I	0	“ This is how I pictured it before I made the suggestion . You in your office , leaning back against your desk in that way you do that ’s sexy as hell . Jacket on the coatrack , maybe a scotch on the rocks next to your hand for an informal touch . ”
78412	78499	78407	78407	I	0	“ Deanna ’s in the chair farthest from you , so she can get the full picture . You give her a slow once - over , say a few double entendres about getting things done together . She gets ideas and seals the deal with a signature on the dotted line . That ’s it . You never get closer than a few feet from her and you never sit down . The glass wall stays clear , so she wo n’t make a move . ”
78500	78510	78514	78514	my	0	“ You imagined all this in a split second ? ”
78511	78512	78514	78514	my	0	“ Well”—I
78515	78528	78514	78514	my	0	temple—“I have some memories rattling around up here that fueled the fire . ”
78529	78543	78544	78544	he	0	“ My memories of seduction in my office do n’t include anyone else , ”
78548	78553	78554	78554	I	0	“ Listen , ace . ”
78561	78578	78554	78554	I	0	“ It was a spontaneous thought that came to me because I was worried about you . ”
78584	78593	78579	78579	Gideon	418	“ Angels rush in . I get it . ”
78594	78598	78602	78602	I	0	“ Do you ? ”
78610	78638	78602	78602	I	0	“ I ’m always going to be possessive , Gideon . You ’re mine . I wish I could put a sign on you that says it . ”
78655	78678	78652	78652	I	0	“ You know how many women are going to pay attention to that when you ’re trolling through Rio with your crew ? ”
78679	78690	78639	78639	He	0	“ They ’ll pay attention when I point it out . ”
78691	78713	78652	78652	I	0	“ Then one of the guys will let slip that it ’s a bachelor party and they ’ll just try harder . ”
78714	78722	78639	78639	He	0	“ Trying wo n’t get them anywhere . ”
78729	78747	78723	78723	My	0	“ You ’ll be irresistible in graphite gray dress slacks and a black V - neck shirt — ”
78748	78758	78759	78759	He	0	“ You ’re remembering that night at the club . ”
78796	78810	78811	78811	he	0	“ I could n’t stop thinking about you after you left my office , ”
78814	78859	78811	78811	he	0	“ Could n’t get the vision of you out of my mind . Then I called you at work and you taunted me , telling me you were going home to play with your vibrator when my cock was hard and ready for you . ”
78906	78918	78919	78919	he	0	“ In my mind , I saw you on your bed , ”
78935	79002	78919	78919	he	0	“ Your legs spread . Your back arching . Your body naked and shiny with sweat as you pushed a thick plastic cock in and out of your creamy cunt . I was half crazed with the idea of it . I ’d never felt lust like that . It felt like I was in heat . The need to fuck was a fever inside me . ”
79003	79008	79009	79009	My	0	“ God , Gideon . ”
79034	79122	79026	79026	He	0	“ I went out before I arranged to meet you . I was going to find someone who would n’t say no like you did . I was going to take her to the hotel , spread her out , fuck her until the madness went away . Who she was did n’t matter . She was going to be faceless , nameless . I was n’t going to look at her while I was inside her . She was just a stand - in for you . ”
79146	79154	79155	79155	His	1308	“ I got close a couple times . ”
79161	79245	79155	79155	His	1308	“ Had a drink while I waited for each one to finish flirting and signal they were ready to leave . I figured I backed off the first time because she just was n’t doing it for me . The second time , I knew no one would do it for me . No one but you . I was furious . At you for denying me . At them for being inferior . At me for being too weak to forget you . ”
79246	79253	79254	79254	I	0	“ That ’s how I felt , ”
79257	79270	79254	79254	I	0	“ Every guy I met was wrong . They were n’t you . ”
79271	79290	79155	79155	His	1308	“ It ’s always going to be that way for me , Eva . Just you . Always . ”
79291	79300	79301	79301	I	0	“ I ’m not worried about you cheating , ”
79468	79480	79481	79481	I	0	“ The women who see you will want to do this , ”
79484	79495	79481	79481	I	0	“ Touch you like this . They ’ll imagine it . ”
79511	79522	79501	79501	Gideon	418	“ I ’ll be imagining you . Just like this . ”
79523	79541	79501	79501	Gideon	418	“ That ’ll only make it worse , because they ’ll see how bad you want it . ”
79542	79549	79550	79550	he	418	“ How badly I want you , ”
79605	79616	79617	79617	I	0	“ I can see them finding the best vantage point , ”
79622	79660	79617	79617	I	0	“ staring at you with fuck - me eyes . Running their fingers down their cleavage so you appreciate their assets . They shift on their feet , crossing and recrossing their legs because they want this . ”
79694	79736	79672	79672	He	418	“ Your mind ’s on me , so you ’re hard . And if you ’re sitting like this , with your legs spread , they can see how big your cock is and how ready you are to use it . ”
79764	79774	79777	79777	his	418	“ You look like this . Do n’t move . ”
79784	79817	79775	79775	I	0	“ You ’ll have a tumbler in this hand , with two fingers of dark cachaça inside it . You sip it every now and then , licking it off your lips . ”
79899	79907	79908	79908	I	0	“ You ’ll seem distant and remote , ”
79912	79972	79908	79908	I	0	“ Lost in your own thoughts . Bored by the frenetic energy and pounding music . The guys ebb and flow around you . Manuel always has a hot beauty on his lap . A different one every time you look . As far as he ’s concerned , there ’s more than enough of him to go around . ”
79976	79994	79973	79973	Gideon	418	“ And he has a fondness for Latinas . He totally approves of my choice in wives . ”
79995	79998	79999	79999	I	0	“ Wife , ”
80002	80008	79999	79999	I	0	“ Your first and last . ”
80009	80013	80014	80014	he	418	“ My only , ”
80017	80068	80014	80014	he	418	“ Hot - tempered . Hot - blooded . My one and only permanent one - night stand . I know exactly how it will be between us , and then you go and take me by surprise . You eat me alive , every time , and want more . ”
80090	80148	80069	80069	I	0	“ Arash stops by with a new drink for you every time he makes his way around the room . He tells you stories about what he ’s seen while circling and you briefly look amused , which drives the women watching you wild . That little flash of intimacy and warmth only makes them want more . ”
80149	80153	80154	80154	he	418	“ And Arnoldo ? ”
80164	80233	80069	80069	I	0	“ He ’s detached , like you . He ’s wounded and wary from his broken heart , but he ’s accessible . He flirts and smiles , but there ’s always that sense of something unreachable about him . The women who are too intimidated by you will go for Arnoldo . He ’ll make them forget you , even while he ’s forgetting about them altogether . ”
80243	80271	80240	80240	his	418	“ While I sit there stewing and brooding with a perpetual hard - on , missing you so badly I ca n’t have any fun at all ? ”
80272	80284	80285	80285	I	0	“ That ’s the way I ’m picturing it , ace . ”
80295	80329	80285	80285	I	0	“ And the women will be envisioning themselves coming up to you and sitting on your lap like I am . They ’ll want to push their hands up your shirt like this . ”
80372	80396	80353	80353	My	0	“ They ’ll fantasize about how hard your body is beneath your clothes , how your pecs will feel when they squeeze them . ”
80474	80480	80481	80481	I	0	“ No , stay still , ”
80484	80492	80481	80481	I	0	“ You would n’t touch them back . ”
80493	80503	80505	80505	he	418	“ They would n’t be near me at all . ”
80725	80732	80733	80733	he	418	“ Take it slow , angel , ”
80737	80757	80733	80733	he	418	“ Work it in . I ’ll be in you all night and I do n’t want you sore . ”
80765	80774	80775	80775	I	0	“ They would n’t imagine taking you slow , ”
80793	80812	80778	80778	Gideon	418	“ You ’re not thinking of other women now , angel . It ’s you you ’re picturing . ”
80931	80936	80937	80937	My	0	“ Oh , Gideon . ”
80988	81030	80980	80980	his	418	“ You do n’t want me wearing a sign . You want me wearing you , your tight , little cunt squeezing my cock . You imagine yourself topping me , as I just sit back and let you have it . ”
81049	81058	81031	81031	He	418	“ Or do you want me to participate ? ”
81069	81072	81064	81064	I	0	“ No . ”
81143	81153	81154	81154	he	418	“ They ’re watching you , are n’t they ? ”
81157	81222	81154	81154	he	418	“ Watching you . When I lift , they can catch a glimpse of you , see how large your cock really is . They want it , ache for it , but it ’s mine . You ’re the one watching me . You ca n’t take your eyes off me . For you , there ’s no one else in the room . ”
81223	81235	81236	81236	His	418	“ But I still do n’t touch you , do I ? ”
81246	81304	81236	81236	His	418	“ I sip the cachaça casually , as if I do n’t have the sexiest woman alive riding my dick in full view of everyone . I ’m not bored anymore , but then , I never was . I was waiting . For you . Knowing you were there because of the hum in my blood . ”
81520	81528	81529	81529	he	418	“ I ’m so hard inside you , ”
81544	81590	81529	81529	he	418	“ The music is loud , so no one hears the sounds I make , but you can feel them . You know you ’re driving me crazy . The fact that I do n’t show it turns you on as much as being watched . ”
81591	81595	81596	81596	I	0	“ Your control , ”
81604	81613	81614	81614	he	418	“ Because I ’m topping from the bottom , ”
81618	81656	81614	81614	he	418	“ You pretend to be in charge , but that ’s not what you want . I know your secrets , Eva . I ’ll know them all . There ’s nothing you can hide from me . ”
82049	82054	82055	82055	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
82067	82078	82055	82055	I	0	“ You ’re not avoiding the bed , are you ? ”
82079	82085	82086	82086	he	1324	“ No . I should , ”
82089	82098	82086	82086	he	1324	“ but no . I could n’t sleep . ”
82099	82107	82108	82108	I	0	“ Want me to wear you out ? ”
82138	82142	82127	82128	My husband	317	“ Come here . ”
82167	82173	82159	82159	I	0	“ Something ’s bugging you . ”
82203	82213	82200	82200	he	317	“ Is there anything you have n’t told me ? ”
82224	82228	82214	82214	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
82229	82233	82234	82234	His	317	“ Like anything . ”
82242	82250	82234	82234	His	317	“ Do you have any secrets left ? ”
82263	82278	82251	82251	I	0	“ Your birthday present . But I ’m not telling you what it is . ”
82286	82290	82291	82291	I	0	“ And you , ”
82299	82324	82291	82291	I	0	“ All the pieces of you that only I know . You are a secret I will keep until I breathe my last breath . ”
82336	82339	82325	82325	His	317	“ Angel . ”
82340	82347	82291	82291	I	0	“ Has something happened , Gideon ? ”
82362	82382	82357	82357	He	317	“ Would you tell me if someone you knew , someone close to you , was doing something illegal ? ”
82393	82406	82386	82386	my	0	“ What have you heard ? Is some gossip blog spreading lies ? ”
82411	82418	82407	82407	He	317	“ Answer the question , Eva . ”
82419	82427	82407	82407	He	317	“ No one ’s doing anything illegal ! ”
82428	82436	82437	82437	he	317	“ That ’s not what I asked , ”
82448	82464	82443	82443	I	0	“ Yes , I ’d tell you . Of course . I tell you everything . ”
82477	82495	82468	82468	His	317	“ You can trust me with anything , angel . It does n’t matter what it is . ”
82496	82500	82501	82501	I	0	“ I do . ”
82506	82518	82501	82501	I	0	“ I do n’t understand why you ’re talking like this . ”
82519	82529	82468	82468	His	317	“ I do n’t want any secrets between us . ”
82536	82556	82530	82530	I	0	“ You ’re the one who ’s been guiltiest about that . You never used to tell me anything . ”
82557	82564	82501	82501	I	0	“ I ’m working on that . ”
82565	82583	82530	82530	I	0	“ I know you are . That ’s why things are really good between us right now . ”
82590	82598	82501	82501	I	0	“ They are , are n’t they ? ”
82599	82602	82603	82603	I	0	“ Totally . ”
82609	82618	82603	82603	I	0	“ No more running , no more hiding . ”
82633	82639	82640	82640	I	0	“ What are we doing ? ”
82656	82665	82649	82649	He	317	“ You ’re going to wear me out . ”
82666	82669	82640	82640	I	0	“ Yay . ”
82720	82729	82709	82709	he	317	“ What are your plans for the day ? ”
82738	82762	82732	82732	I	0	“ I ’m going back to sleep when you leave . Just for an hour . Blaire Ash is stopping by at ten . ”
82763	82767	82768	82768	He	317	“ Is he ? ”
82775	82778	82768	82768	He	317	“ Why ? ”
82779	82820	82732	82732	I	0	“ I ’m changing things around . We ’re going to turn the guest bedroom into a home office with a Murphy bed . That way , we still have room for guests and I have a place to work . ”
82838	82845	82821	82821	Gideon	418	“ We did n’t discuss that . ”
82846	82849	82850	82850	I	0	“ True . ”
82863	82874	82850	82850	I	0	“ I did n’t want you to argue about it . ”
82924	82933	82934	82934	he	418	“ We should n’t be sharing a bed , ”
82938	82942	82944	82944	he	418	“ I disagree . ”
82954	82980	82944	82944	he	418	“ I tried to make the best of it , Gideon , but I ’m not happy with the idea of being apart like that . ”
82996	83012	82981	82981	He	418	“ It ’s not fair to make me choose between your happiness and your safety . ”
83013	83051	83052	83052	I	0	“ I know . But I ’m not making you choose , I already decided . I ’m aware that ’s not fair , either , but the call had to be made and I made it . ”
83072	83109	82981	82981	He	418	“ We made the call together . Then you apparently changed your mind without discussing it further . And flashing your tits at me — as stunning as they are — isn’t going to distract me . ”
83117	83138	83110	83110	I	0	“ If I wanted to distract you , I would n’t have brought the subject up in the first place . ”
83139	83146	83147	83147	he	1332	“ Cancel the consult , Eva , ”
83151	83160	83147	83147	he	1332	“ We need to talk about this first . ”
83161	83196	83110	83110	I	0	“ The consult already happened . We had to cut it short because the cops came over , but Blaire ’s already working on new designs . He ’s bringing me some ideas today . ”
83210	83222	83197	83197	Gideon	418	“ So your happiness comes first and to hell with mine ? ”
83223	83234	83147	83147	he	1332	“ You ’re not happy sharing a bed with me ? ”
83242	83266	83238	83238	his	418	“ Do n’t jerk me around . You ’re not taking into consideration what it would do to me if I hurt you . ”
83274	83277	83268	83268	my	0	“ Gideon — ”
83278	83292	83293	83293	he	418	“ And you ’re not thinking about what it would do to us , ”
83297	83375	83293	83293	he	418	“ I ’ll let you experiment with a lot of things , Eva , but nothing that ’s going to damage our relationship . If you want to fall asleep next to me , I ’ll be there . If you want to wake up with me beside you , I can do that , too . But the hours in between when we ’re both unconscious are too dangerous to gamble with on a fucking whim . ”
83533	83536	83537	83537	I	0	“ Okay , ”
83540	83590	83537	83537	I	0	“ Let ’s agree to this : Blaire will drop off his concepts and we ’ll look them over together later . In the meantime , we ’ll agree not to knock down any walls in the guest room . I think that ’s going too far , Gideon . ”
83591	83599	83659	83659	his	418	“ You did n’t think so before . ”
83600	83638	83537	83537	I	0	“ It ’s a stopgap that may become permanent and we do n’t want that . I mean , you do n’t want that , do you ? You want to work on sleeping together , right ? ”
83668	83713	83661	83661	he	418	“ Yes , I want that . It kills me that I ca n’t give you something so basic in our marriage . And knowing you ’re unhappy about it … I ’m sorry , angel . I ca n’t tell you how much . ”
83722	83752	83717	83717	I	0	“ We ’ll work on it . I should ’ve started by talking it out . Guess I pulled a Gideon on you — act first , explain later . ”
83758	83761	83762	83762	He	418	“ Touché . ”
83771	83781	83762	83762	He	418	“ Watch out for Blaire . He wants you . ”
83786	83792	83793	83793	I	0	“ He finds me attractive , ”
83796	83806	83793	83793	I	0	“ And he ’s a natural - born flirt . ”
83816	83824	83807	83807	Gideon	418	“ Has he been hitting on you ? ”
83825	83859	83860	83860	I	0	“ Nothing unprofessional . If he crossed a line I ’d fire him myself , but I think he probably finesses all his female clients . I bet it ’s good for business . ”
83863	83893	83860	83860	I	0	“ He cooled his jets when I told him I was getting used to your stamina and did n’t feel like I needed a separate bed for sleep anymore . ”
83899	83904	83894	83894	His	418	“ You did n’t . ”
83905	83960	83860	83860	I	0	“ I totally did . I can sleep when I ’m dead , I told him . In the meantime , if my husband wants to hit it with me a half - dozen times every night and he ’s as skilled as he is at doing it , who am I to complain ? ”
84065	84089	84059	84059	I	0	“ I ’m a blonde with big tits . Throw a giggle in there and I can usually get away with saying anything . ”
84090	84093	84094	84094	Gideon	418	“ Christ . ”
84106	84124	84094	84094	Gideon	418	“ Is it a compulsion of yours to share the details of our sex life with everyone ? ”
84125	84128	84129	84129	I	0	“ No . ”
84132	84139	84129	84129	I	0	“ But it ’s certainly fun . ”
84184	84198	84175	84175	he	168	“ Hey , Parker . It ’s Eva Tramell . How are you ? ”
84199	84214	84175	84175	he	168	“ I ’m good . You coming in today ? You ’re slacking lately . ”
84220	84248	84215	84215	I	0	“ I know . And yes , I ’m coming in . That ’s why I ’m calling . I want to work on something with you . ”
84249	84258	84175	84175	he	168	“ Yeah ? What ’s on your mind ? ”
84259	84296	84215	84215	I	0	“ We ’ve gone over situational awareness and what to do if you ’re cornered , how to get away . But what if I ’m completely taken off guard , like when I ’m sleeping ? ”
84301	84322	84297	84297	He	168	“ A hard knee shot in the balls will lay any man out . Gives you the opening you need . ”
84390	84409	84377	84377	I	0	“ But what if … How would you knee someone when they ’re lying on top of you ? ”
84410	84422	84423	84423	He	418	“ We can work it out . Choreograph some different scenarios . ”
84426	84431	84423	84423	He	418	“ Everything all right ? ”
84432	84437	84438	84438	I	0	“ Everything ’s great , ”
84447	84483	84438	84438	I	0	“ It just came up on a TV show I was watching last night and I realized that no matter how prepared you are , you ca n’t be situationally aware when you ’re sleeping . ”
84484	84503	84438	84438	I	0	“ No problem . I ’ll be at the warehouse in a couple hours and stay until closing . ”
84504	84509	84438	84438	I	0	“ Okay . Thanks . ”
84540	84547	84438	84438	I	0	“ Hey , what ’s up ? ”
84548	84564	84565	84565	I	0	“ I ’ve been thinking . You said something about a classic dress , right ? ”
84641	84651	84652	84652	he	348	“ What about one of Monica ’s bridal gowns ? ”
84655	84676	84652	84652	he	348	“ Something old and all that . You two have the same build . It would n’t take much alteration . ”
84677	84715	84716	84716	He	348	“ Ugh . Really ? No , Cary . If she ’d married my dad in it , maybe . But I ca n’t wear something she wore to marry a stepdad . That ’s just weird . ”
84719	84733	84716	84716	He	348	“ Yeah , you ’re right . She has great taste , though . ”
84743	84770	84734	84734	I	0	“ I do n’t think she keeps her wedding dresses , anyway . Not a great souvenir to have hanging around your new husband ’s house . ”
84771	84802	84652	84652	he	348	“ Okay , so it ’s a stupid idea . We can hunt for something vintage . A pal of mine knows every couture and designer consignment shop in Manhattan . ”
84808	84817	84652	84652	he	348	“ Cool . That ’s a good idea . ”
84818	84838	84734	84734	I	0	“ Sometimes , I ’m brilliant . I ’m tied up with Grey Isles today , but tonight works . ”
84839	84846	84652	84652	he	348	“ I have couples counseling tonight . ”
84847	84872	84734	84734	I	0	“ Oh , right . Have fun with that . Tomorrow ? Maybe we ’ll pick up a few things for Ibiza , too . ”
84911	84923	84734	84734	I	0	“ Tomorrow ’s good . I ’ll come to the apartment . ”
84924	84933	84908	84909	my friends	2473	“ Sweet . We ’ll pack , too . ”
85037	85044	85045	85046	Dr. Petersen	0	“ How are you both doing ? ”
85081	85088	85089	85089	I	0	“ We ’re better than ever , ”
85115	85124	85125	85126	Dr. Petersen	0	“ I received an invitation to your reception . ”
85129	85142	85125	85126	Dr. Petersen	0	“ My wife and I are very much looking forward to it . ”
85223	85228	85229	85229	I	0	“ Me , too . ”
85244	85251	85252	85253	Dr. Petersen	0	“ The last time we met , ”
85256	85271	85252	85253	Dr. Petersen	0	“ you ’d just quit your job , Eva . How has that been ? ”
85272	85289	85252	85253	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Easier than I thought . I ’ve been busy , though , so that helps . ”
85290	85295	85252	85253	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Helps with what ? ”
85301	85326	85296	85296	I	0	“ From feeling aimless . I ’m busier now . And I ’m working on things that actually make a difference in my life . ”
85327	85331	85252	85253	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Such as ? ”
85332	85366	85296	85296	I	0	“ The wedding , of course . And moving into the penthouse , which I ’m doing in baby steps . And planning some renovations , which I ’d like to talk about . ”
85367	85371	85372	85372	He	418	“ Of course . ”
85376	85393	85372	85372	He	418	“ Let ’s talk about those baby steps first . Is there any significance to that ? ”
85394	85412	85296	85296	I	0	“ Well , just that I ’m not doing it all at once . It ’s ongoing . ”
85413	85443	85372	85372	He	418	“ Do you view it as a way to ease into the commitment ? Previously , you ’ve acted very decisively . Eloping . Separating . Quitting your job . ”
85449	85466	85446	85446	me	0	“ It ’s a transition that affects Gideon and Cary as much as it does me . ”
85467	85475	85476	85476	Gideon	418	“ As far as I ’m concerned , ”
85479	85490	85476	85476	Gideon	418	“ the sooner she ’s moved in , the better . ”
85491	85498	85499	85499	I	0	“ I ’m just being careful . ”
85513	85520	85502	85503	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Is Cary having difficulty adjusting ? ”
85521	85527	85528	85528	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
85531	85552	85528	85528	I	0	“ He ’s not acting like he is . But I worry . He falls into bad habits without support . ”
85553	85564	85606	85606	Gideon	418	“ Do you have any thoughts about that , Gideon ? ”
85571	85584	85565	85565	He	0	“ I knew what I was getting into when I married her . ”
85585	85591	85592	85593	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Always a good thing . ”
85596	85605	85592	85593	Dr. Petersen	0	“ But that does n’t tell me much . ”
85623	85651	85606	85606	Gideon	418	“ As a married man yourself , Doctor , you know there are concessions a husband makes to keep the peace . Cary is one of mine . ”
85703	85725	85697	85698	Dr. Petersen	0	“ So you ’re attempting to balance the needs of both your husband and your best friend . Is that stressful ? ”
85726	85732	85733	85733	I	0	“ It ’s not fun , ”
85736	85755	85733	85733	I	0	“ but it ’s not really balancing , either . My marriage — and Gideon — comes first . ”
85775	85778	85779	85779	I	0	“ But , ”
85782	85814	85779	85779	I	0	“ I do n’t want to overwhelm Gideon and I do n’t want Cary to feel abandoned . Moving a small bag of stuff over every day makes the change gradual . ”
85856	85864	85865	85865	he	418	“ You ’ve mentioned everyone but you , ”
85869	85875	85865	85865	he	418	“ How do you feel ? ”
85876	85917	85949	85950	My husband	317	“ The penthouse is starting to feel like home . The only thing I ’m struggling with is our sleeping arrangements . We ’ve been sharing a bed , but Gideon wants us to sleep separately and I do n’t . ”
85918	85924	85925	85926	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Because of the nightmares ? ”
85934	85937	85938	85938	he	0	“ Yes , ”
85941	85948	85949	85950	My husband	317	“ Have you had any lately ? ”
85953	85960	85949	85950	My husband	317	“ Not the really bad ones . ”
85961	85976	85977	85977	Gideon	418	“ What constitutes a really bad nightmare ? One that you act out physically ? ”
85986	85989	85977	85977	Gideon	418	“ Yes . ”
85997	86016	85990	85991	The doctor	542	“ You understand the risk , Eva , but you still want to share a bed with Gideon . ”
86017	86023	86024	86024	My	0	“ Yes , of course . ”
86081	86089	86090	86091	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Many happily married couples sleep separately , ”
86095	86130	86090	86091	Dr. Petersen	0	“ The reasons are varied — the husband snores , the wife steals the covers , et cetera — but they find that sleeping apart is more conducive to marital harmony than sleeping together . ”
86143	86216	86131	86131	I	0	“ I like sleeping next to him . Sometimes , I wake up in the middle of the night and I watch him sleep . Sometimes , I wake up and I do n’t even open my eyes , I just listen to him breathing . I can smell him , feel his warmth . I sleep better when he ’s beside me . And I know he sleeps better , too . ”
86217	86220	86221	86221	Gideon	418	“ Angel . ”
86263	86296	86257	86257	I	0	“ I know it hurts you . I ’m sorry . I just need us to work toward having that . I do n’t want us to ever give up on it . ”
86297	86302	86303	86304	Dr. Petersen	0	“ What you describe , ”
86308	86352	86303	86304	Dr. Petersen	0	“ is intimacy , Eva . And it ’s one of the true joys of marriage . It ’s understandable that you crave it . Everyone does to some extent . For you and Gideon , however , it probably seems particularly important . ”
86353	86359	86360	86360	I	0	“ It does to me , ”
86363	86373	86374	86374	Gideon	418	“ Are you implying it ’s different for me ? ”
86378	86381	86382	86382	I	0	“ No . ”
86388	86407	86382	86382	I	0	“ Please do n’t get defensive . This is n’t your fault . I ’m not blaming you . ”
86408	86419	86420	86420	he	0	“ Do you know how shitty this makes me feel ? ”
86423	86438	86382	86382	I	0	“ I wish you would n’t take it personally , Gideon . It ’s — ”
86439	86456	86457	86457	he	0	“ My wife wants to watch me sleep and I ca n’t even give her that , ”
86460	86470	86457	86457	he	0	“ What is that , if not fucking personal ? ”
86471	86478	86479	86480	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Okay , let ’s discuss , ”
86490	86524	86479	86480	Dr. Petersen	0	“ The root of this conversation is a craving for intimate familiarity . Human beings , by nature , desire intimacy , but childhood sexual abuse survivors can find this need especially acute . ”
86536	86541	86542	86543	the doctor	542	“ In many cases , ”
86546	86602	86542	86543	the doctor	542	“ the abuser works hard to isolate the victim to help conceal their crime and make the victim dependent . The victims themselves very often withdraw from friends and family . Everyone else ’s lives seem so ordinary and the troubles of others so insignificant next to the terrible secret they feel forced to hide . ”
86653	86725	86649	86649	he	0	“ That deep loneliness was alleviated when you both opened up to each other , but being starved of true intimacy for so long leaves a mark . I urge you to consider alternative ways to achieve the closeness you crave , Eva . Create signals and rituals that are unique to your relationship , that do n’t threaten either one of you and bring you both a sense of connection . ”
86731	86738	86739	86739	he	0	“ We ’ll work on it , ”
86742	86781	86739	86739	he	0	“ And your nightmares , Gideon , are likely to continue to lessen in quantity and severity as we do . But this is just the beginning . We ’ve taken some first steps in a long journey . ”
86793	86797	86798	86798	I	0	“ A lifetime , ”
86840	86848	86849	86849	Raúl	2446	“ I’VE BEEN COMMUNICATING with Benjamin Clancy , ”
86861	86887	86849	86849	Raúl	2446	“ You and Mrs. Cross will be heading toward the airport at the same time , so you can travel together , if you like . ”
86888	86892	86893	86893	I	0	“ Of course . ”
86928	86950	86951	86952	A professional	1360	“ I ’ll call her and let her know we ’ll be picking her up . We ’ll need the limo . ”
87056	87069	87051	87051	Raúl	2446	“ We ’ll make separate transportation arrangements for her friends and yours . ”
87070	87078	87051	87051	Raúl	2446	“ How is Eva getting to Ibiza ? ”
87079	87083	87084	87084	he	2446	“ Private jet , ”
87087	87147	87084	87084	he	2446	“ chartered by Richard Stanton . I suggested they stay at the Hotel Vientos Cruzados Ibiza and Clancy agreed . It took some doing , as the resort is fully booked for the summer season , but the property manager was able to make it happen . They ’ve stepped up security in anticipation of Mrs. Cross ’s arrival . ”
87148	87151	87153	87153	Eva	2431	“ Good . ”
87230	87236	87237	87237	he	110	“ As we discussed previously , ”
87241	87289	87237	87237	he	110	“ we ’ll have our own team in place at the airport , and they ’ll follow Mrs. Cross over the weekend . They ’ve been instructed to stay in plainclothes and blend in , providing backup for Clancy ’s team and interceding only when absolutely necessary . ”
87390	87407	87387	87387	Raúl	2446	“ I ’ll touch base with Clancy to discuss the protocol for getting to the airport . ”
87408	87413	87387	87387	Raúl	2446	“ Thanks , Raúl . ”
87427	87454	87421	87421	Angus	73	“ I ’ll be hieing off to take Lucky to your sister . She ’s texting me every hour to see if I ’ve left yet . ”
87511	87523	87502	87502	Angus	73	“ Have fun , lad . It ’ll do you good . ”
87527	87535	87524	87524	I	0	“ Call me if you find anything . ”
87536	87540	87541	87541	He	73	“ Of course . ”
87570	87575	87576	87576	she	0	“ Hi , ace , ”
87585	87596	87576	87576	she	0	“ Ca n’t stop thinking about me , can you ? ”
87597	87606	87613	87613	her	0	“ Tell me you were thinking about me . ”
87607	87610	87576	87576	she	0	“ Always . ”
87701	87714	87715	87715	I	0	“ You and I are going to ride to the airport together , ”
87719	87722	87715	87715	I	0	“ Alone . ”
87723	87726	87727	87727	She	0	“ Oh . ”
87733	87739	87727	87727	She	0	“ That ’ll be nice . ”
87740	87749	87715	87715	I	0	“ I ’m shooting for more than nice . ”
87750	87753	87754	87754	Her	0	“ Ohhh … ”
87773	87781	87754	87754	Her	0	“ Got a little transportation fetish yourself ? ”
87892	87899	87900	87900	I	0	“ I have an Eva fetish , ”
87913	87916	87917	87917	She	2431	“ Good . ”
87922	87929	87917	87917	She	2431	“ Is the weekend over yet ? ”
87942	87953	87932	87932	Cary	348	“ Soon , angel . I ’ll let you go . ”
87954	87964	87998	87998	she	2431	“ Do n’t ever let me go , Gideon . ”
88012	88022	88023	88023	I	0	“ I ’ll let you get back to it , ”
88026	88038	88023	88023	I	0	“ So you can be ready when Raúl comes for you . ”
88039	88053	88054	88054	she	2431	“ Never mind him . I ’ll be ready to come for you , ”
88109	88116	88093	88093	He	116	“ You ready for the weekend ? ”
88117	88127	88128	88128	I	0	“ As ready as I ’m going to be . ”
88142	88159	88093	88093	He	116	“ You ’ll be happy to hear that Anne Lucas ’s assault complaint is going away . ”
88175	88180	88160	88160	I	0	“ As it should . ”
88181	88222	88093	88093	He	116	“ I have n’t heard if she ’ll be charged with falsely reporting an incident . In the meantime , if she attempts contact with you , Eva , or Cary in any way , I need to know immediately . ”
88227	88231	88223	88223	I	0	“ Of course . ”
88236	88245	88232	88232	He	116	“ Where ’s your head at right now ? ”
88251	88280	88232	88232	He	116	“ I just got off the phone with one of the Vidal Records board members . Christopher is continuing to work on acquiring the capital for a buyout . ”

88301	88314	88335	88335	she	169	“ If I only had him to worry about , I would . ”
88389	88396	88433	88433	I	0	“ What does the board think ? ”
88397	88417	88433	88433	I	0	“ It ’s viewed as a family feud and they want me to find a quick , painless resolution . ”
88418	88432	88433	88433	I	0	“ Is that possible ? You ’ve never gotten along with your brother . ”
88438	88444	88433	88433	I	0	“ It ’s a nonstarter . ”
88474	88483	88471	88471	He	116	“ Sorry , man . That ’s tough . ”
88926	88929	88930	88930	I	0	“ Here , ”
88973	88980	88958	88958	She	2431	“ You should ’ve come in . ”
88981	88990	88991	88991	I	0	“ You and me with a bed nearby ? ”
89004	89029	88991	88991	I	0	“ I would ’ve taken advantage , if I did n’t think Cary would bang on the door and bitch about missing your flight . ”
89083	89089	89072	89072	They	1403	“ You look super sexy . ”
89112	89119	89120	89120	she	2431	“ You usually wear dark colors , ”
89124	89134	89120	89120	she	2431	“ Too hot for that where we ’re going . ”
89135	89141	89142	89142	She	2431	“ You ’re too hot . ”
89220	89228	89211	89211	She	2431	“ There ’s going to be traffic . ”
89229	89232	89211	89211	She	2431	“ Damn . ”

89576	89596	89597	89597	Her	2431	“ You ca n’t . The groom is n’t supposed to see the wedding dress before the big day . ”
89605	89620	89597	89597	Her	2431	“ You saw the dress I wore when we got married the first time ! ”
89630	89641	89642	89642	I	0	“ It was only a dress when I saw it , ”
89645	89657	89642	89642	I	0	“ It was n’t a wedding dress until you wore it . ”

89733	89741	89726	89726	she	2431	“ Are you picturing something in particular ? ”
89754	89773	89746	89746	Her	2431	“ A tux . You ’re always gorgeous . But in a tuxedo , you ’re something else . ”
89912	89920	89959	89959	her	2431	“ A tux it is , then . ”
89932	89940	89921	89921	Her	2431	“ But it ’s a beach wedding . ”
89941	89948	89962	89962	she	2431	“ I ’ll make it work . ”
89949	89957	89921	89921	Her	2431	“ Yes , I bet you can . ”

90036	90041	90042	90042	she	2431	“ In my mouth , ”

90240	90250	90226	90226	I	0	“ Take it deeper … yes , like that … ”
90279	90287	90288	90288	I	0	“ I wo n’t finish like this , ”

90467	90478	90454	90454	her	2431	“ You ’ll be right here , angel . Always . ”
90482	90493	90494	90494	Manuel	219	“ Mano , you ca n’t be working right now , ”

99892	99917	99885	99885	her	345	“ I had hoped you two would have a quiet , normal life . But the world is n’t going to let that happen . ”

100086	100133	100077	100077	I	0	“ It ’s going to be okay . We wo n’t always be so interesting to people . And we ’re going away for a month after the wedding . That ’s nearly a lifetime with no news about us . The media will move on . ”
100134	100139	100140	100140	she	345	“ I hope so , ”
100143	100165	100140	100140	she	345	“ You ’re getting married on Saturday . I ca n’t believe it . There ’s still so much to do . ”
100210	100222	100223	100223	I	0	“ Why do n’t you come over to the penthouse tomorrow ? ”
100226	100257	100223	100223	I	0	“ I would love for you to see it and we can discuss everything that still needs to be decided . We ’ll have lunch in and just hang out . ”
100262	100275	100258	100258	Her	345	“ What a wonderful idea ! I would love that , Eva . ”

100535	100552	100527	100527	He	418	“ Do n’t worry , angel . I ’ll give you more when I get home . ”
100553	100564	100495	100495	He	418	“ I want to throw something at you right now . ”

100663	100683	100660	100660	He	418	“ I know . When I get home , would you like me to fuck you while wearing it ? ”

100777	100783	100784	100784	he	418	“ It ’s your favorite , ”
100800	100805	100806	100806	he	418	“ Home , right ? ”
100809	100828	100730	100730	I	0	“ Yes , my mom will be here in a few hours and I have calls to make . ”
100835	100847	100829	100829	He	418	“ Take a nap , grumpy angel . Dream about me . ”

101046	101053	101054	101055	My mom	345	“ Yes , it ’s great . ”

101122	101150	101115	101115	She	345	“ Which it wo n’t . All of the staff are going to make sure they do everything right . This is their boss ’s big day . ”
101151	101154	101155	101155	She	345	“ Yes . ”
101161	101174	101155	101155	She	345	“ You ’re right . They ’ll want everything to be perfect . ”
101175	101181	101115	101115	She	345	“ And it will be . ”
101237	101242	101243	101244	my mom	345	“ What is it ? ”
101247	101262	101263	101263	My	0	“ I do n’t know . Gideon wants me to turn the TV on . ”
101361	101365	101366	101367	my mother	345	“ My God , ”
101370	101376	101366	101367	my mother	345	“ What is he doing ? ”
101463	101470	101471	101472	my mom	345	“ Well , that ’s subtle , ”
101475	101485	101471	101472	my mom	345	“ Why is he giving this any more attention ? ”
101490	101497	101486	101486	I	0	“ He ’s got a plan . ”
101533	101545	101546	101549	one of the hosts	1614	“ Should we even be having bachelor and bachelorette parties anymore ? ”
101552	101566	101567	101567	Gideon	418	“ Well , that ’s one of the things I can clear up , ”
101577	101601	101567	101567	Gideon	418	“ Since Eva and I married last month and I ’m no longer a bachelor , it could n’t be a bachelor party . ”
101643	101646	101647	101647	I	0	“ Wow , ”
101650	101655	101647	101647	I	0	“ He outed us . ”
101750	101753	101754	101754	he	418	“ Obviously , ”
101764	101826	101754	101754	he	418	“ I could n’t be in New York and Brazil at the same time . The photo that went viral was digitally altered to remove the club ’s logo . You can see that it ’s embroidered into the curtains of the VIP lounge . All it took was the right software and a couple of clicks to make it disappear . ”
101827	101834	101835	101838	one of the hosts	1614	“ But the girls were there , ”
101841	101851	101835	101838	one of the hosts	1614	“ and what was happening with them was real . ”
101852	101865	101866	101866	he	418	“ True . I had a life before my wife came along , ”
101872	101881	101866	101866	he	418	“ I ca n’t change that , unfortunately . ”
101882	101907	101908	101908	She	1614	“ She had a life before you , too . She ’s the Eva mentioned in , um , a Six - Ninths song . ”
101912	101918	101908	101908	She	1614	“ ‘ Golden Girl . ’ ”
101930	101937	101938	101938	he	418	“ Yes , that ’s her , ”
101986	101989	102017	102017	Gideon	418	“ Golden Girl ”
102008	102016	102017	102017	Gideon	418	“ How do you feel about that ? ”
102026	102042	102017	102017	Gideon	418	“ If I were a songwriter , I ’d compose ballads about her , too . ”
102097	102106	102107	102107	I	0	“ Ooh , he ’s good at this , ”
102123	102154	102114	102115	My mom	345	“ He ’s sincere , but still aloof and confident enough to seem like the legendary Gideon Cross . And he gave them a ton of photos to work with . ”
102225	102247	102218	102221	One of the hosts	1614	“ There ’s a book coming out about you , too , is n’t there ? Written by your former fiancée ? ”
102310	102315	102316	102316	he	418	“ Ghostwritten , actually , ”
102319	102344	102316	102316	he	418	“ By someone with an ax to grind . I ’m afraid Mrs. Giroux is being taken advantage of and ca n’t see it . ”
102345	102357	102358	102358	She	345	“ I did n’t realize that . Who ’s the ghostwriter ? ”
102371	102386	102316	102316	he	418	“ I ’m not at liberty to say who ’s actually writing the book . ”
102393	102409	102387	102388	The host	1616	“ But you know him ? Or her ? And they do n’t like you . ”
102410	102419	102464	102465	My husband	317	“ That ’s correct — on both counts . ”
102420	102433	102387	102388	The host	1616	“ Is it an ex - girlfriend ? A former business partner ? ”
102445	102463	102434	102443	The one host who ’d been mostly listening switched gears	1616	“ About Corinne … Why do n’t you tell us what the story is there , Gideon ? ”
102479	102521	102464	102465	My husband	317	“ Mrs. Giroux and I dated in college . We were engaged for a time , but even then , the relationship was n’t going anywhere . We were immature and , truthfully , too ignorant to know what we wanted . ”
102522	102527	102608	102608	Corinne	984	“ That ’s it ? ”
102528	102588	102464	102465	My husband	317	“ Being young and confused is n’t very interesting or salacious , is it ? We remained friends after she married . I ’m sorry she feels the need to commercialize that particular time in our lives now that I ’m married . I ’m sure this is as awkward for Jean - François as it is for me . ”
102589	102607	102608	102608	Corinne	984	“ That ’s her husband , right ? Jean - François Giroux . Do you know him ? ”
102660	102667	102657	102657	Gideon	418	“ We ’re in business together . ”
102668	102677	102657	102657	Gideon	418	“ Have you talked about this with him ? ”
102678	102690	102657	102657	Gideon	418	“ No . I do n’t discuss it all , usually . ”
102699	102713	102657	102657	Gideon	418	“ I ’m a newlywed . I have other things on my mind . ”
102720	102745	102714	102714	I	0	“ Yay ! That was my idea . I told him to keep reminding people she ’s married and that he knows her husband . ”
102762	102772	102773	102774	my mom	331	“ You knew he was going to do this ? ”
102810	102832	102797	102797	she	331	“ No . I had no idea . We talked about the Giroux thing a while ago . Are you okay ? ”
102841	102848	102833	102833	She	331	“ I ’ve got a headache . ”
102849	102865	102866	102866	I	0	“ Hang on till this is over and I ’ll get you something for that . ”
102908	102917	102901	102902	my mother	331	“ You ’re leaving ? What about lunch ? ”
102918	102933	102949	102949	she	331	“ I ’m tired , Eva . I ’m going home to lie down . ”
102934	102946	102947	102947	I	0	“ You could take a nap here in the guest room . ”
103023	103042	103006	103006	She	331	“ I ’ll be fine . We covered the most important things . I ’ll call you later . ”
103077	103082	103083	103083	SCOTT	514	“ MR . CROSS . ”
103090	103099	103083	103083	SCOTT	514	“ Will you be in today after all ? ”
103116	103132	103111	103111	Angus	73	“ I just have to take care of something . I ’ll be in tomorrow . ”
103207	103218	103219	103219	he	73	“ You ’ve had a busy few days , lad , ”
103227	103233	103234	103234	I	0	“ Never a dull moment . ”
103242	103249	103234	103234	I	0	“ Tell me you have something . ”
103254	103298	103250	103250	Angus	73	“ Little more than I had to start with : a marriage license with a fictitious hometown and Jackson Tramell ’s death certificate , which has Lauren Kittrie listed as his spouse . He was dead less than a year after they we d. ”
103308	103317	103299	103299	I	0	“ Lauren lied about where she was from ? ”
103321	103327	103318	103318	He	73	“ Easy enough to do . ”
103328	103332	103334	103334	him	73	“ But why ? ”
103344	103350	103334	103334	him	73	“ There ’s something else . ”
103351	103360	103361	103361	he	73	“ Manner of death is listed as undetermined , ”
103365	103375	103361	103361	he	73	“ Jackson took a bullet to the right temple . ”
103380	103392	103361	103361	he	73	“ They could n’t decide if it was suicide or homicide ? ”
103393	103407	103361	103361	he	73	“ Aye . It couldnae be determined conclusively one way or the other . ”
103433	103436	103437	103437	I	0	“ Fuck . ”
103445	103457	103437	103437	I	0	“ I just want a photo , for God ’s sake . ”
103458	103491	103437	103437	I	0	“ It ’s been a long time , Gideon . A quarter of a century . Maybe someone from her hometown would remember her , but we dinnae know where that is . ”
103513	103524	103501	103501	I	0	“ You think someone went through and tidied things up . ”
103525	103547	103556	103556	He	73	“ It ’s possible . Also possible that the police report of Jackson ’s death was truly misplaced over the years . ”
103548	103555	103501	103501	I	0	“ You do n’t believe that . ”
103567	103615	103556	103556	He	73	“ I brought in a lass to pose as an IRS agent looking for Lauren Kittrie Tramell . She questioned Monica Dieck , who said she has n’t seen her former sister - in - law in many years and to her knowledge , Lauren is deceased . ”
103632	103652	103616	103616	I	0	“ Monica was scared , lad . When she heard Lauren ’s name she went white as a ghost . ”
103663	103683	103658	103658	I	0	“ What the fuck does that mean ? None of this is getting me any closer to the truth . ”
103684	103695	103616	103616	I	0	“ There ’s someone else who might have the answers . ”

103757	103785	103752	103752	Angus	73	“ From what we ken of Eva ’s mother , protecting her daughter has always been a priority . I cannae see her putting Eva at risk . ”
103786	103831	103723	103723	I	0	“ Her overprotectiveness is exactly my concern . She ’s been tracking Eva ’s movements for God knows how long . I assumed it was because of Nathan Barker . But maybe he was just part of the reason . Maybe there ’s more . ”
103832	103843	103752	103752	Angus	73	“ Raúl and I are already working on revised protocols . ”

104093	104102	104081	104081	I	0	“ I thought you ’d like the surprise . ”
104103	104115	104119	104119	she	2431	“ Well , yeah . But still . That was huge . ”
104303	104324	104281	104281	he	158	“ Hey , I get it . I like you , too , but I do n’t lick your face . ”
104396	104405	104390	104390	I	0	“ How did things go with your mother ? ”
104406	104420	104426	104426	She	528	“ Good , I guess . We ’re pretty much ready for Sunday . ”

He sent me a picture of it , but it ’s been in storage so long , I could n’t really make it out . So he scanned a photo of her wearing it on her wedding day and it ’s perfect ! It ’s totally what I did n’t know I wanted ! ”

104960	104963	104964	104964	She	2345	“ Fiend . ”
104969	105029	104964	104964	She	2345	“ I feel like it ’ll be good for the relatives on that side to see me in it . I ’ve been worried that they ’ll feel out of place , but now I ’ll be wearing the dress , so they have to feel like they ’re included in a big way . Do n’t you think ? ”
105030	105033	105034	105034	I	0	“ Agreed . ”

105075	105088	104964	104964	She	2345	“ Always . But for now , just a kiss will do . ”
105089	105092	105046	105046	She	2345	“ Hmm . ”
105117	105124	105096	105096	she	2345	“ It ’s impressive , son . ”

105480	105497	105498	105498	He	348	“ All the time in the world would n’t have seen me build something like this . ”
105528	105558	105582	105582	He	348	“ It ’ll be a lot of work , keeping this standing . Same with a marriage . Eventually , you ’ll have to put one before the other . ”

105939	105948	105949	105949	She	2431	“ Do n’t look at me like that . ”
105960	106013	105949	105949	She	2431	“ He ’s lonely , Gideon . He ’s on his own , without his family . It ’s a rough time for him . I figured I ’d make something simple for dinner and we could watch a movie . Take his mind off the divorce for a while , maybe . ”
106048	106051	106041	106041	I	0	“ Fine . ”
106071	106079	106080	106081	Dr. Petersen	0	“ I just finished watching your interview , ”
106091	106118	106085	106085	he	0	“ My wife told me about it earlier and I was able to catch it on the Internet . Very well done . I enjoyed it . ”
106130	106143	106124	106124	I	0	“ A necessary evil , but I agree , it went well . ”
106144	106149	106080	106081	Dr. Petersen	0	“ How ’s Eva ? ”
106150	106163	106124	106124	I	0	“ Are you asking me how she reacted to seeing that photo ? ”

106182	106187	106188	106188	I	0	“ She ’s okay . ”
106203	106208	106188	106188	I	0	“ We ’re good . ”
106318	106333	106363	106363	He	1682	“ You and Eva both say things are good . What does that mean ? ”

106382	106408	106363	106363	He	1682	“ The photo ’s a good one . There were times in our relationship when a photo like that would ’ve really screwed us up . ”
106409	106415	106363	106363	He	1682	“ This time was different . ”
106416	106466	106363	106363	He	1682	“ Very . Eva and I discussed having my bachelor party in Rio before I left . She ’s very jealous . She always has been and I do n’t mind . In fact , I like it . But I do n’t like her torturing herself with it . ”
106467	106474	106363	106363	He	1682	“ Jealousy is rooted in insecurity . ”
106475	106523	106363	106363	He	1682	“ Let ’s change the word , then . She ’s territorial . I will never touch another woman for the rest of my life and she knows that . But she has an active imagination . And that photo was everything she feared in living color . ”
106564	106617	106363	106363	He	1682	“ Eva was thousands of miles away when the damn thing exploded online and I had nothing in the way of proof . I had only my word and she believed me . No questions . No doubt . I explained as best I could and she accepted it as the truth . ”
106618	106623	106524	106525	Dr. Peterson	248	“ That surprises you . ”

106633	106652	106630	106630	I	0	“ You know , now that I ’m talking about this , it really did n’t surprise me . ”
106653	106656	106524	106525	Dr. Peterson	248	“ No ? ”
106657	106704	106630	106630	I	0	“ We both had a rough moment there , but we did n’t fuck it up . It was like we knew how to make it right between us . And we knew that we would . There was n’t any doubt about that , either . ”
106709	106722	106705	106705	He	0	“ You ’re being very candid . In the interview and now . ”
106726	106745	106723	106723	I	0	“ Amazing what a man will do when faced with losing the woman he ca n’t live without . ”
106746	106761	106630	106630	I	0	“ You were angry about her ultimatum before . Resentful . Are you still ? ”

106789	106839	106781	106781	she	1683	“ She wants me to talk , I ’ll talk . It does n’t matter what I throw at her , what mood I ’m in when I tell her , how horrible she feels when she hears it … She can deal . And she loves me more . ”
106866	106877	106853	106854	Dr. Petersen	0	“ I ’ve never heard you laugh like that before . ”
106885	106893	106878	106878	I	0	“ Do n’t get used to it . ”
106894	106917	106853	106854	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Oh , I do n’t know about that . More talking . More laughter . They ’re connected , you know . ”
106918	106925	106878	106878	I	0	“ Depends on who ’s talking . ”
106933	106943	106926	106926	His	0	“ You stopped talking when your mother stopped listening . ”
106948	106959	106960	106960	he	0	“ It ’s said that actions speak louder than words , ”
106964	106982	106960	106960	he	0	“ but we still need words . We need to speak and we need to be heard . ”
106994	107008	107009	107009	He	0	“ Your wife is listening to you , Gideon . She believes you . ”
107013	107051	107009	107009	He	0	“ I ’m listening and I believe you . So you ’re talking again and getting a different response from the one you ’ve conditioned yourself to expect . It opens things up , does n’t it ? ”
107052	107060	107117	107118	Dr. Petersen	0	“ Opens me up , you mean . ”
107064	107085	107061	107061	He	0	“ It does . To love and acceptance . To friendship . Trust . A whole new world , really . ”
107097	107107	107089	107089	I	0	“ What am I supposed to do with that ? ”
107108	107116	107117	107118	Dr. Petersen	0	“ More laughter is a good start . ”
107131	107139	107117	107118	Dr. Petersen	0	“ We ’ll figure out the rest . ”
107204	107212	107215	107215	I	0	“ Heard me coming , did you ? ”
107284	107287	107288	107288	he	1013	“ Hi , ”

109681	109711	109670	109670	I	0	“ But she was quite serious , so I ’ve made the offer . If you ’re interested , Scott can put you together with someone in human resources . ”

110152	110163	110109	110109	she	2357	“ It ’s highly contagious . Caught it from you . ”
110164	110170	110171	110171	Her	2357	“ Oh , did you ? ”
110183	110191	110192	110193	Steven Ellison	97	“ There ’s the big man himself , ”

110349	110369	110391	110391	She	2431	“ You ’re welcome to . The more , the merrier . We ’re heading to Bryant Park Grill . ”

111135	111142	111143	111143	Mark	116	“ So here ’s the thing , ”
111151	111165	111143	111143	Mark	116	“ Part of the reason Eva quit was because of the LanCorp proposal … ”
111186	111194	111166	111166	She	2357	“ Ryan Landon offered you a job . ”
111199	111205	111195	111195	His	564	“ How ’d you know ? ”
111216	111226	111206	111206	She	2357	“ You ’re not taking it , are you ? ”
111227	111230	111231	111231	Mark	116	“ No . ”
111239	111315	111231	111231	Mark	116	“ It would have been a lateral move . Nothing like the bump I ’ll get with Cross Industries . More than that , though , I remembered you telling me that there ’s bad blood between Landon and Cross . I looked it up after you quit . Knowing the background , the whole thing was n’t sitting right — him declining to work with us , then trying to poach me right after . ”
111316	111328	111329	111329	Eva	2431	“ Could be he just wants you , without the agency , ”
111335	111342	111332	111332	Steven	97	“ That ’s what I said . ”
111386	111393	111394	111394	Mark	116	“ You do n’t believe that , ”
111402	111405	111406	111406	she	2431	“ No , ”
111409	111478	111406	111406	she	2431	“ I do n’t . I ’ll be honest , I baited them . Told them Gideon and I are very fond of you and look forward to working with you again . I wanted to see if they ’d bite . I figured if it was a great offer , I was doing you a favor . And if it was n’t , no harm no foul . ”
111482	111499	111479	111479	He	1742	“ But why would you do that ? Do n’t you want me at Cross Industries ? ”
111500	111508	111509	111509	I	0	“ Of course we do , Mark , ”
111512	111519	111509	111509	I	0	“ Eva was honest with them . ”
111520	111527	111528	111528	she	1743	“ I was testing the waters , ”
111531	111562	111528	111528	she	1743	“ I debated saying something to you , but I did n’t want you to feel awkward if he offered you a great job that you might seriously consider taking . ”
111563	111571	111572	111572	Steven	97	“ So what do you do now ? ”
111575	111578	111579	111579	Eva	2431	“ Now ? ”
111582	111645	111579	111579	Eva	2431	“ Gideon and I are planning a vow renewal ceremony and then taking off for a long honeymoon . Ryan Landon is n’t a problem that ’s going away any time soon . He ’ll be around , doing his thing . I just wo n’t underestimate him . And Mark is going to start a great new job with Cross Industries . ”
111708	111714	111695	111695	Mark	116	“ Sounds good to me . ”
111718	111728	111729	111729	Eva	2431	“ Do you want to play naughty secretary again ? ”
111770	111779	111780	111780	I	0	“ I do have to work sometime today , ”
111801	111812	111784	111784	She	2431	“ How can I be of service , Mr. Cross ? ”
111825	111842	111813	111813	I	0	“ What do you think about me asking Chris to stand with me at our wedding ? ”
111858	111861	111853	111853	She	2431	“ Really ? ”
111862	111865	111813	111813	I	0	“ Thoughts ? ”
111874	111889	111869	111869	she	2431	“ I ’d like to hear yours first , before I give you mine . ”
111930	111949	111912	111914	my best friend	2431	“ After Rio , I was going to ask Arnoldo , once I ’d discussed it with you . ”
111950	111958	111959	111959	she	2431	“ I ’d be okay with that , ”
111970	111985	111959	111959	she	2431	“ It ’s a decision you should make for yourself and not for me . ”
111986	112003	111912	111914	my best friend	2431	“ He understands what we have together and that it ’s good for both of us . ”
112007	112012	112004	112004	She	2431	“ I ’m glad . ”
112013	112018	112019	112019	I	0	“ Me , too . ”
112024	112030	112019	112019	I	0	“ But after last night … ”
112031	112038	112004	112004	She	2431	“ Which part of last night ? ”
112039	112064	112019	112019	I	0	“ Dinner with Chris . It got me thinking . Things have changed . And there was something Dr. Petersen said . I just … ”
112080	112134	112065	112065	She	2431	“ I want someone who knows everything to be standing with me when you come down the aisle . I do n’t want there to be any pretense . Not for something this important . When we face each other and say our vows again , I need that to be … real . ”
112135	112140	112141	112141	She	2431	“ Oh , Gideon . ”
112172	112177	112178	112178	she	2431	“ You beautiful man , ”
112181	112192	112178	112178	she	2431	“ You do n’t even know how romantic you are . ”
112210	112221	112193	112193	I	0	“ Do n’t cry . I ca n’t stand it . ”
112236	112246	112247	112247	she	2431	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m this happy , ”
112259	112309	112247	112247	she	2431	“ It does n’t seem real sometimes . Like I ’m dreaming , and I ’m going to wake up and realize I ’m still on the floor in the lobby , looking at you for the first time and imagining all this because I want you so badly . ”
112349	112355	112338	112338	Her	2431	“ Chris will be delighted . ”
112366	112371	112361	112361	I	0	“ You did this . ”
112382	112386	112387	112387	she	2431	“ Did I ? ”
112401	112423	112387	112387	she	2431	“ It ’s all you , ace . I ’m just the lucky girl who gets a front - row seat . ”
112531	112536	112526	112526	Her	2431	“ I love you . ”

112591	112622	112586	112586	She	2431	“ And you have to work . But you ca n’t stay late . I ’m going to have fun helping you into your tux — and out of it . ”
112682	112685	112693	112693	Scott	514	“ Gideon . ”

112827	112833	112834	112834	I	0	“ This is a surprise , ”
112844	112852	112834	112834	I	0	“ What brings you into the city ? ”
112853	112859	112860	112860	She	85	“ I just left Corinne . ”
112880	112906	112860	112860	She	85	“ She ’s in pieces over that interview you gave yesterday . Completely destroyed . You have to go see her . Talk to her . ”
112921	112928	112907	112907	I	0	“ Why would I do that ? ”
112929	112935	112936	112936	she	85	“ For God ’s sake , ”
112949	112962	112936	112936	she	85	“ You need to apologize . You said some very hurtful things — ”
112963	112984	112907	112907	I	0	“ I told the truth , which is likely more than can be said about that book she ’s publishing . ”
112985	113019	112936	112936	she	85	“ She did n’t know you had a history with that woman … that ghostwriter . She told her editor she could n’t work with that person as soon as she found out . ”
113020	113059	112907	112907	I	0	“ I do n’t care who writes the book . A different author wo n’t change the fact that Corinne ’s violating my privacy and putting something out in the world with the potential to hurt my wife . ”
113064	113122	113060	113060	Her	1753	“ I ca n’t even talk about your wife , Gideon . I ’m upset — no . I ’m furious that you would get married without your family , your friends . Does n’t that tell you anything ? That you had to do something so important without the blessing of the people who love you ? ”
113123	113134	113135	113135	My	0	“ Are you implying that no one would ’ve approved ? ”
113139	113186	113135	113135	My	0	“ That ’s certainly not true , but even if it were , choosing someone to spend your life with is n’t decided with a majority rule . Eva and I married privately because it was intimate and personal and did n’t need to be shared . ”
113187	113225	113226	113226	she	1754	“ But you shared the news with the world ? ! Before you shared it with your family ! I ca n’t believe you could be so thoughtless and insensitive . You need to make things right , ”
113230	113262	113226	113226	she	1754	“ You have to be responsible for the pain you inflict on others . I did n’t raise you this way . I ca n’t tell you how disappointed I am . ”
113338	113355	113329	113329	I	0	“ You do n’t get to lecture me about inflicting pain or feeling disappointed , Mother . ”
113368	113377	113356	113356	Her	1754	“ Do n’t take that tone with me . ”
113378	113392	113356	113356	Her	1754	“ You knew what was done to me . And you did nothing . ”
113393	113402	113403	113403	She	1754	“ We ’re not talking about this again . ”
113411	113420	113421	113421	I	0	“ When have we ever talked about it ? ”
113425	113441	113421	113421	I	0	“ I told you , but at no point were you open to discussing it . ”
113442	113450	113356	113356	Her	1754	“ Do n’t make this my fault ! ”
113451	113456	113421	113421	I	0	“ I was raped . ”
113510	113515	113516	113516	I	0	“ I was raped , ”
113526	113554	113524	113524	Steadier	258	“ For close to a year , every week . A man you invited into your home fondled me . Sodomized me . Over and over again . ”
113555	113559	113560	113560	She	2357	“ Do n’t . ”
113568	113578	113560	113560	She	2357	“ Do n’t say those ugly , awful things . ”
113579	113631	113524	113524	Steadier	258	“ It happened . Repeatedly . While you were only a few rooms away . He ’d be nearly panting with excitement when he showed up . He ’d stare at me with this sick gleam in his eyes . And you could n’t see it . Refused to see it . ”
113632	113638	113560	113560	She	2357	“ That ’s a lie ! ”
113673	113694	113668	113668	she	2431	“ What ’s the lie , Mother ? That I was raped ? Or that you chose to ignore it ? ”
113695	113700	113701	113701	she	2431	“ Stop saying that ! ”
113706	113721	113701	113701	she	2431	“ I took you to be examined . I tried to find the proof — ”
113722	113730	113668	113668	she	2431	“ Because my word was n’t enough ? ”
113731	113750	113701	113701	she	2431	“ You were a disturbed child ! You lied about everything . Anything . The most obvious things . ”
113751	113779	113668	113668	she	2431	“ That gave me some control ! I had no power over anything in my life — aside from the words that came out of my mouth . ”
113780	113798	113799	113799	She	2431	“ And I was supposed to just magically divine what was truth and what was a lie ? ”
113807	113825	113799	113799	She	2431	“ You were seen by two doctors . You would n’t let the one anywhere near you — ”
113826	113847	113668	113668	she	2431	“ And have another man touch me there ? Can you even grasp how terrifying that thought was to me ? ”
113848	113854	113799	113799	She	2431	“ You let Dr. Lucas — ”
113855	113863	113864	113864	I	0	“ Ah , yes . Dr. Lucas . ”
113868	113928	113864	113864	I	0	“ Where did you get his name , Mother ? From the man molesting me ? Or from your doctor , who was overseeing his dissertation ? Either way , he steered you right toward his brother - in - law , knowing the well - respected Dr. Lucas would say anything to protect the reputation of his family . ”
113943	113948	113949	113949	I	0	“ He sedated me , ”
113986	113995	113970	113970	he	0	“ He examined me . Then he lied . ”
113996	114003	114004	114004	she	1757	“ How would I know that ? ”
114017	114021	114022	114022	I	0	“ You knew , ”
114026	114069	114022	114022	I	0	“ I remember your face afterward , when you told me Hugh was n’t coming back and to never bring it up again . You could barely look at me , but when you did , I saw it in your eyes . ”
114101	114110	114111	114111	I	0	“ Did you think Chris would leave you ? ”
114115	114171	114111	114111	I	0	“ Did you think it was too much for your new family to take ? For years , I thought you told him — I heard you mention Dr. Lucas to him — but Chris did n’t know . Tell me what reason a wife would have to keep something like that from her husband . ”
114207	114211	114194	114194	My	0	“ Say something ! ”
114212	114231	114232	114232	She	331	“ You ’re wrong . Wrong . It ’s all twisted up for you . You do n’t … ”
114238	114250	114232	114232	She	331	“ It did n’t happen that way . You ’re confused … ”
114455	114486	114450	114450	I	0	“ Let ’s end this . I wo n’t be going to see Corinne . And I wo n’t apologize for telling the truth . I ’m done with that . ”
114586	114594	114583	114583	I	0	“ Are you sure you ’re okay ? ”
114635	114639	114640	114640	His	418	“ Stop asking . ”
114645	114650	114640	114640	His	418	“ I ’m fine . ”
114651	114667	114640	114640	His	418	“ When a woman says she ’s fine , it means she ’s anything but . ”

129020	129067	128954	128954	I	0	“ She was right by my side , but I knocked her down to get her out of the way . Knocked the breath right out of her . She passed out and when she came to , I told her it was a false alarm . ”
129068	129073	129074	129074	He	1975	“ Oh , Gideon . ”
129078	129084	129074	129074	He	1975	“ That was n’t wise . ”
129085	129102	128954	128954	I	0	“ It was the right decision . There ’s nothing she can do about what happened . ”

129160	129189	129156	129156	I	0	“ Until I know what the threat is , I wo n’t have her out in the open , which is exactly where she ’d want to be ! ”
129190	129198	129139	129139	his	1975	“ That ’s her choice to make . ”

129288	129305	129227	129227	I	0	“ She would n’t put her safety first . She ’d want to be with Stanton . ”

129389	129403	129404	129404	I	0	“ Do n’t tell me what would be best for her right now , ”
129408	129433	129404	129404	I	0	“ I wo n’t let her go there . She would be haunted for the rest of her life if she saw … that . ”
129440	129457	129434	129434	He	1978	“ The longer you wait , the more difficult this will be for both of you . ”
129458	129485	129434	129434	He	1978	“ I ’m going to tell her as soon as she wakes up . You ’re going to come over here and help me do that . ”
129486	129489	129434	129434	He	1978	“ Gideon — ”
129490	129513	129514	129514	I	0	“ I ’ve talked to her father in California . He ’ll be on his way soon . And Cary ’s here . ”

129557	129605	129631	129632	my wife	2357	“ You ’re not seeing that Eva ’s biggest source of strength and comfort is you , Gideon . And by failing to disclose something of this magnitude and being dishonest about it initially , you ’ve put her most depended - upon foundation on shaky ground . ”
129606	129616	129617	129617	I	0	“ You think I do n’t know that ? ! ”
129634	129649	129617	129617	I	0	“ I ’m … Jesus . I ’m terrified she wo n’t forgive me . ”
129677	129691	129667	129667	I	0	“ But I would do it again . This situation , these stakes … ”
129692	129755	129650	129651	Dr. Petersen	0	“ All right . You ’ll need to talk to her about all of this as soon as she wakes up . Be frank about what you ’re feeling , and focus on that rather than logic or your rationale . She may not agree with you or see your point , but understanding the emotional impetus behind your actions will help . ”
129756	129760	129761	129761	I	0	“ Do you ? ”
129764	129805	129650	129651	Dr. Petersen	0	“ I do , yes . Which is n’t to say I would n’t have recommended a different course of action , but I understand . I ’m going to give you another number where you can reach me directly . ”
129818	129845	129846	129846	he	1980	“ Talk to Eva . Afterward , if you still want me there , I ’ll come by . I ca n’t promise to respond immediately , ”

130515	130523	130495	130495	I	0	“ Eva . We need to talk . ”
130535	130540	130528	130528	she	2357	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
130541	130572	130495	130495	I	0	“ Splash some water on your face while I fix you a cup of coffee , okay ? And wait here in the bedroom until I bring it to you . ”
130576	130581	130573	130573	She	2357	“ You sound serious . ”
130582	130593	130573	130573	She	2357	“ I am . And you need to be awake . ”
130594	130597	130603	130603	Eva	2431	“ Okay . ”

130886	130908	130880	130880	I	0	“ I lied to you . I ’m going to defend that decision when I ’m done , but for now … ”
130913	130920	130909	130909	Her	2431	“ Spit it out , ace . ”
130921	130947	130948	130948	I	0	“ You were right about the gunshots you heard . One of the photographers opened fire on us last night . Your mother was hit . ”

131003	131010	131011	131011	I	0	“ She was shot , Eva . ”
131025	131034	131011	131011	I	0	“ It was fatal . I ’m sorry . ”
131040	131075	131035	131035	Her	2431	“ I do n’t have any answers to give you right now . They have the shooter in custody and Raúl has told me that Detectives Graves and Michna were assigned to the case . ”
131076	131082	131083	131083	she	2431	“ They ’re homicide cops , ”

131114	131124	131083	131083	she	2431	“ Why would someone want to kill my mother ? ”
131125	131181	131083	131083	she	2431	“ I do n’t know , Eva . It might have been random . Could be he missed his target . We could call Graves or Michna — you still have their cards , right ? They might not tell us anything , but I ’m expecting them to come by and take our statements . ”
131182	131191	131083	131083	she	2431	“ Why ? I do n’t know anything . ”

131428	131475	131521	131521	she	2345	“ She was already gone , Eva . I wo n’t lie to you again — I did n’t know whether anyone had been hit when I got you out of there . The most important thing was to get you somewhere safe . After that — ”
131476	131480	131387	131387	Her	2003	“ Never mind . ”

131829	131852	131824	131824	He	2014	“ It will hit her , eventually . For now , she ’s dealing with it the only way she knows how . ”
131853	131874	131798	131798	she	2431	“ ‘ Eventually ’ is n’t quantifiable ! I just need to know when … how … what to do . ”

132001	132030	131798	131798	she	2431	“ The bloodshot eyes , the morning stubble . You do n’t look like the husband Eva counts on to keep it together and do everything he can . ”

132302	132319	132294	132294	Chris	1667	“ You ’re both going to get through this . You have family and friends looking — ”
132320	132324	132294	132294	Chris	1667	“ What family ? ”
132332	132338	132339	132339	I	0	“ No , do n’t , ”
132362	132384	132351	132351	I	0	“ Look , I ’m glad you ’re here . I did n’t expect it , but I ’m glad . … ”
132393	132400	132401	132401	he	1667	“ Then learn to expect it , ”
132405	132449	132401	132401	he	1667	“ Because I ’m not backing off this time , Gideon . We ’re family . Maybe now we can start to think about what that means to all of us . You and me . Your mother , Christopher , and Ireland . ”
132544	132559	132539	132539	I	0	“ Christopher would need a complete personality transplant to ever be family to me . ”
132566	132579	132560	132560	Chris	1667	“ I know you and Christopher do n’t get along , but — ”
132580	132594	132595	132595	I	0	“ Through no fault of mine . Let ’s be clear about that . ”
132609	132621	132595	132595	I	0	“ Has he ever discussed with you why he hates me ? ”
132656	132665	132648	132648	Chris	1667	“ He does n’t hate you , Gideon . ”
132896	132904	132886	132886	I	0	“ I need to show you something . ”
132968	132980	132981	132981	I	0	“ I do n’t know how much of this is true , ”
132984	133022	132981	132981	I	0	“ Hugh ’s notes about his sessions with me are all lies . This reads like he was building a profile of me to use as a defense , in case we ever filed charges against him . ”
133023	133028	132940	132940	Chris	1667	“ We should have . ”
133038	133045	132940	132940	Chris	1667	“ How did you get these ? ”
133046	133088	132981	132981	I	0	“ It does n’t matter . What ’s important is that he has notes from four different sessions with Christopher . One of them was supposedly a group session with me . Either that ’s a fabrication or I ’ve forgotten . ”
133089	133097	132940	132940	Chris	1667	“ Which do you think it is ? ”
133098	133117	133118	133118	I	0	“ I really ca n’t say . There are … chunks of my childhood I ca n’t remember . ”

133163	133180	133129	133129	Chris	1667	“ I do n’t know — you’ll have to ask Christopher — but I doubt it . ”

133185	133229	133230	133230	My	0	“ The dates and times on Hugh ’s notes put Christopher ’s sessions directly following mine . If those time stamps are correct — which would be wise if he was covering his tracks — then he would n’t have it in him . ”
133252	133286	133248	133248	Hugh	123	“ He was a sick piece of shit , but — listen , there ’s no tidy way to say this . He never had anything left after he was done with me . ”

133422	133456	133411	133411	he	123	“ Christopher told me once , recently , that I ’d wanted him dead since the day he was born . I had no idea what he was talking about , but now … ”

133564	133580	133555	133555	Chris	1667	“ You do n’t have to convince me , Gideon . Your word is enough . ”

134036	134047	134033	134033	I	0	“ And the tall Scotsman over there is Angus McLeod . ”

134149	134155	134156	134156	Chris	1667	“ I ’ll get it , ”

134421	134429	134430	134430	Grave	279	“ You did n’t see the shooter ? ”
134433	134493	134505	134505	Eva	2431	“ No . I heard Raúl shout and I got Eva on the ground . It ’s protocol for the security team to evacuate at the first sign of trouble . They escorted us away in the opposite direction and I did n’t look back . My focus was on my wife , who was unconscious at the time . ”
134494	134504	134538	134538	Michna	170	“ You did n’t see Monica Stanton go down ? ”
134517	134537	134512	134512	I	0	“ No . I had no idea anyone had been injured until several minutes after we left the scene . ”

134565	134625	134556	134556	She	2431	“ I hit the sidewalk pretty hard . Gideon rolled over me , holding me down . I could n’t breathe , and then someone covered Gideon . They were both so heavy … I thought I heard two , maybe three shots . I ’m not sure . When I came to , I was in the limo . ”
134626	134629	134630	134630	Michna	170	“ Okay . ”

134746	134750	134751	134751	He	73	“ Of course . ”
134758	134768	134751	134751	He	73	“ He ’s the one who shot Mrs. Stanton ? ”
134769	134797	134829	134829	Her	2431	“ Yes . His name is Roland Tyler Hall . Have you ever had contact with this man , Mr. Cross ? Ever recall speaking with him ? ”
134798	134801	134802	134802	I	0	“ No , ”
134817	134828	134813	134813	Eva	2431	“ Was he stalking her ? Some kind of obsession ? ”
134908	134919	134896	134896	Graves	183	“ It ’s not your mother Hall was fixated on . ”
135099	135108	135109	135109	I	0	“ He did n’t sell all of these , ”
135117	135151	135112	135112	Graves	183	“ Most of the photos Hall took for himself . When money ran low , he ’d sell a few . He has n’t worked in months and lives out of his car . ”

135328	135346	135318	135318	Cary	348	“ Was this guy just a really bad shot ? Or did he confuse Monica for Eva ? ”
135347	135354	135355	135355	I	0	“ He was n’t stalking Eva , ”
135401	135408	135392	135392	Graves	183	“ Hall is obsessed with you . ”
135632	135641	135642	135642	I	0	“ I want to be sure I understand , ”
135657	135664	135642	135642	I	0	“ This man was stalking Gideon ? ”
135672	135681	135665	135666	My dad	348	“ Was Hall targeting my daughter or Cross ? ”
135682	135689	135690	135690	Graves	183	“ Hall believes Cross betrayed him , ”

135741	135753	135725	135725	she	698	“ If he could n’t have Gideon , no one could ? ”
135754	135758	135759	135759	She	698	“ Not quite . ”
135764	135815	135759	135759	She	698	“ Hall believes he has an ‘ entwined destiny ’ with you — some kind of cosmic pact — and that your marriage breaks this pact between you . Killing you is the only way to prevent his life from going in a direction he does n’t want to go . ”
135816	135824	135825	135825	Cary	348	“ Is that supposed to make sense ? ”
135842	135850	135851	135851	Michna	170	“ Hall ’s fixation is n’t sexual , ”
135884	135897	135879	135879	he	348	“ It ’s not even romantic . He claims he ’s heterosexual . ”
135913	135920	135898	135898	Graves	183	“ You both know this woman . ”
135937	135941	135942	135942	Cary	348	“ Fuck me , ”
135960	135967	135968	135968	Chris	1667	“ I saw her last night , ”

135993	135998	135999	136000	my dad	348	“ Who is that ? ”
136009	136015	136016	136016	Graves	183	“ Dr. Anne Leslie Lucas , ”
136019	136051	136016	136016	Graves	183	“ She ’s the psychiatrist who was treating Hall , although she met with him at a second office away from her primary practice , using the alias Dr. Aris Matevosian . ”
136061	136067	136052	136052	Gideon	418	“ I know that name . ”
136077	136080	136068	136068	Graves	183	“ How ? ”
136081	136091	136092	136092	He	418	“ Just a moment . I ’ll show you . ”
136170	136179	136180	136181	my father	348	“ Will someone explain who Dr. Lucas is , ”
136184	136193	136180	136181	my father	348	“ and her relevance to Hall and Monica ? ”
136194	136206	136207	136207	Michna	170	“ We ’ll let Cross fill us all in on that , ”
136210	136219	136220	136220	I	0	“ They had a sexual relationship awhile back , ”
136300	136308	136309	136309	I	0	“ She got wrapped up in it , ”
136313	136366	136309	136309	I	0	“ and wanted to leave her husband , so Gideon broke it off . She has n’t been able to move on or get past it . She showed up at my building once , and tried approaching Cary a couple times , wearing a wig , pretending to be someone else . ”
136377	136396	136367	136367	Graves	183	“ We reviewed her complaint . You and Cross confronted her , separately , on two different occasions . ”
136397	136403	136404	136405	My dad	348	“ Damn it , Eva . ”
136417	136422	136404	136405	My dad	348	“ You know better . ”
136423	136427	136428	136428	I	0	“ Know what ? ”
136432	136460	136428	136428	I	0	“ I still do n’t understand what this all means . She was harassing my best friend and my husband . I told her to back off . ”
136481	136499	136476	136476	Michna	170	“ A prescription for Corinne Giroux written by Dr. Aris Matevosian . Why do you have this ? ”
136500	136511	136512	136512	Gideon	418	“ There was a time , a couple months ago , ”
136522	136567	136512	136512	Gideon	418	“ when Corinne became erratic . I discovered she ’d been seeing a therapist who prescribed antidepressants , which were causing her mood swings . I took a picture of the label so I ’d know who to contact if she continued having problems . ”
136634	136642	136643	136643	he	348	“ So Anne was Hall ’s therapist , ”
136652	136657	136643	136643	he	348	“ Why the alias ? ”
136658	136665	136666	136666	Grave	279	“ She thought she was smart , ”
136670	136729	136666	136666	Grave	279	“ We ’re smarter . And we have Hall , who is very disturbed but also very cooperative . He confessed the minute we sat down with him . He was also clever — or paranoid — enough to secretly record all of his sessions with Dr. Lucas , which we recovered during a search of his vehicle . ”
136730	136739	136740	136740	I	0	“ Did she put him up to this ? ”
136752	136766	136767	136767	Michna	170	“ I do n’t think Hall was ever playing with a full deck , ”
136770	136799	136767	136767	Michna	170	“ but he used to have a job , a place to live , and no particular interest in Cross . Anne Lucas did a number on him . ”
136813	136861	136800	136800	Graves	183	“ He mentioned to her that he dropped out of school after the Cross Ponzi scheme wiped out his grandparents . It was n’t something he held a grudge over , but she got him thinking that his life and Cross ’s are paralleled in some way . ”
136862	136871	136872	136872	I	0	“ Can she go to jail for that ? ”
136879	136907	136872	136872	I	0	“ What she did — that ’s part of the reason my mom ’s … gone . She ca n’t just get away with that , right ? ”
136908	136918	136919	136919	Graves	183	“ We picked her up about an hour ago . ”
136929	136944	136919	136919	Graves	183	“ When her lawyer shows up , we ’ll take a crack at her . ”
136945	136959	136960	136960	Michna	170	“ The DA ’s office will determine the full extent of the charges , ”
136963	136989	136960	136960	Michna	170	“ but Hall ’s recordings , plus security footage of both Lucas and Hall entering and leaving her secondary office , gave us probable cause . ”

137002	137006	137007	137007	Graves	183	“ Of course . ”

137058	137069	137070	137070	Michna	170	“ Did either of you speak with her at all ? ”
137073	137076	137077	137077	Gideon	418	“ No . ”
137089	137099	137100	137100	I	0	“ I flipped her the bird from a distance , ”
137113	137137	137100	137100	I	0	“ She had this smirk on her face . Maybe that ’s why she was there , so she could see what happened . ”

137158	137171	137172	137172	Graves	183	“ All right . We ’ve got what we need for now , ”
137176	137201	137172	137172	Graves	183	“ We ’ll just take Mr. McLeod ’s statement regarding the Westport incident and be on our way . Thank you for your time . ”
137212	137215	137216	137216	Graves	183	“ Eva . ”
137234	137243	137227	137227	she	2080	“ I ’m very sorry for your loss . ”

137377	137380	137365	137365	We	2083	“ Yes ? ”

137558	137561	137548	137548	He	418	“ Yes . ”
137576	137586	137562	137562	He	418	“ I feel like I ’m invisible to you . ”
137587	137592	137562	137562	He	418	“ I see you . ”
137593	137596	137597	137597	He	418	“ I … ”
137612	137627	137597	137597	He	418	“ I ’m sorry , Eva . Sorry about Anne … about last night … ”
137628	137632	137597	137597	He	418	“ I know . ”
137719	137723	137724	137724	He	348	“ Damn it . ”
137736	137749	137724	137724	He	348	“ Yell at me . Hit me . For God ’s sake — ”
137750	137753	137724	137724	He	348	“ Why ? ”
137754	137757	137758	137758	He	348	“ Why ? ”
137768	137790	137758	137758	He	348	“ Because this is my fault ! Anne was my problem and I did n’t manage her . I did n’t — ”
137791	137802	137803	137803	I	0	“ You ’re not responsible for her actions , Gideon , ”
137814	137829	137803	137803	I	0	“ Why would you believe you were ? That does n’t make any sense . ”
137844	137883	137837	137837	he	348	“ You ’re not making sense ! Why are n’t you mad that I did n’t tell you about your mother ? You lost it when I hired Mark and did n’t tell you . You left me — ”
137888	137915	137837	137837	he	348	“ You ’re not leaving me over this , Eva . We ’ll work through it … we ’ll figure out how to get past it . ”
137916	137923	137924	137924	I	0	“ I ’m not leaving you . ”
137929	137937	137924	137924	I	0	“ You need to sleep , Gideon . ”
137938	137941	137942	137942	He	348	“ God . ”
137974	137979	137980	137980	he	348	“ Where are you ? ”
137983	137989	137980	137980	he	348	“ Come back to me . ”
138078	138081	138082	138082	Gideon	418	“ Eva . ”
138150	138153	138154	138154	he	348	“ Yes , ”
138160	138169	138154	138154	he	348	“ God , Eva . I love you . ”
138235	138242	138243	138243	he	348	“ Tell me you love me , ”
138246	138261	138243	138243	he	348	“ That you ’ll forgive me . Next week … next year … someday … ”
138262	138267	138268	138268	He	348	“ I love you . ”
138297	138306	138307	138307	he	348	“ I ’ll make it up to you , ”
138310	138317	138307	138307	he	348	“ I ’ll find a way . ”
138318	138321	138351	138352	my mom	345	“ Shh … ”
138369	138374	138354	138354	I	0	“ Kiss me again . ”
138429	138432	138433	138433	He	418	“ Angel . ”
138438	138444	138433	138433	He	418	“ Your dad ’s waiting . ”
138513	138527	138507	138507	Gideon	418	“ Let me be here for you . Do n’t shut me out . ”
138528	138535	138536	138536	I	0	“ I ’m not trying to . ”
138557	138563	138507	138507	Gideon	418	“ There ’s something wrong . ”
138564	138569	138570	138570	he	418	“ Yes . Everything , ”
138574	138589	138570	138570	he	418	“ It ’s all fucked up . I do n’t know what to do . ”
138590	138597	138507	138507	Gideon	418	“ No . Wrong inside me . ”
138598	138614	138615	138615	He	418	“ Eva . How can you say that ? There ’s nothing wrong with you . ”
138625	138630	138631	138631	I	0	“ You nicked yourself . ”
138643	138651	138631	138631	I	0	“ You never do that , either . ”
138652	138663	138664	138664	He	418	“ What ’s going on in that head of yours ? ”
138670	138679	138680	138680	he	418	“ I do n’t know what to do , ”
138684	138693	138680	138680	he	418	“ I do n’t know what to do . ”
138830	138838	138839	138839	Gideon	418	“ We can step into my office , ”
138863	138868	138856	138857	my dad	348	“ Lead the way . ”
138880	138883	138884	138885	My dad	348	“ Eva . ”
138895	138904	138891	138891	I	0	“ I need to speak to Cross alone . ”
138905	138908	138884	138885	My dad	348	“ Why ? ”
138909	138924	138891	138891	I	0	“ I ’ve got things to say that you do n’t need to hear . ”
138931	138934	138925	138925	I	0	“ No . ”
138941	138949	138935	138935	He	348	“ We ’re not arguing about this . ”
138950	138981	138935	138935	He	348	“ Dad , I ’m not a child . Anything you have to say to my husband has something to do with me and I think I should be involved . ”
138982	138988	138989	138989	Gideon	418	“ I have no objection , ”
139012	139015	138997	138998	My father	348	“ Fine . ”
139047	139056	139057	139057	he	1667	“ Whenever you ’re done for the day , ”
139066	139085	139057	139057	he	1667	“ I ’ll explain when I see you . All right . Talk to you then , son . ”
139086	139094	139095	139095	Gideon	418	“ I need my office a minute , ”
139103	139106	139107	139107	His	1667	“ Sure . ”
139116	139135	139107	139107	His	1667	“ I ’ll pull out some plates and things for lunch . We all need to eat something . ”
139280	139283	139284	139284	He	305	“ Angel . ”
139306	139311	139312	139313	My dad	348	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
139347	139352	139353	139353	I	0	“ I ’m okay , ”
139370	139376	139377	139377	Gideon	418	“ You need to eat , ”
139380	139385	139386	139386	I	0	“ So do you , ”
139389	139404	139386	139386	I	0	“ The sooner you two get done , the faster we can do that . ”
139434	139441	139442	139442	he	348	“ I spoke to my family , ”
139446	139461	139442	139442	he	348	“ They still want to come and be here for Eva . And me . ”
139480	139503	139462	139462	Gideon	418	“ Okay . We were going to fly them direct to North Carolina . We ’ll have to adjust the flight plan . ”
139504	139510	139511	139512	my dad	348	“ I would appreciate that , ”
139517	139528	139462	139462	Gideon	418	“ It ’s fine . Do n’t worry about it . ”
139529	139537	139538	139538	I	0	“ Then why do you look worried ? ”
139547	139605	139462	139462	Gideon	418	“ It ’s just … It ’s a madhouse on the street right now . We can bring your family in through the garage , but if word gets out that they ’re in town , they may have to deal with media and photographers at their hotel or anywhere else they may go in the city . ”
139606	139614	139615	139616	my dad	348	“ They ’re not coming to sightsee , ”
139619	139629	139630	139630	Gideon	418	“ That ’s not what I meant , Victor . ”
139634	139654	139630	139630	Gideon	418	“ I ’m just thinking out loud . I ’ll work it out . Consider it taken care of . ”
139689	139723	139678	139678	I	0	“ If they want to come , we should go to the Outer Banks like we planned . We already have the rooms reserved for them . It ’ll be quiet and private . ”
139762	139777	139755	139755	I	0	“ We had catering arranged . We ’d have food and beverages for everyone . ”
139783	139797	139778	139778	Gideon	418	“ I had Scott talk to Kristine . We pulled out of everything . ”
139798	139840	139778	139778	Gideon	418	“ It ca n’t have been more than a few hours ago . The hotel probably has n’t filled the room block in that short of time . And the caterer already has the things well under way at this point . ”
139841	139852	139853	139853	he	418	“ You really want to go to the beach house ? ”
139895	139907	139889	139890	no one	2336	“ Okay , then . I ’ll take care of it . ”
139942	139961	139939	139939	he	348	“ What happened changes everything . For all of us . I want to move to New York . ”
139976	139979	139965	139965	I	0	“ Really ? ”
139980	140009	140010	140010	He	348	“ It ’s going to take some time for me to deal with work and selling my house , but I ’m going to get the ball rolling . ”
140015	140037	140010	140010	He	348	“ I need to be closer than the other side of the damn country . You ’re all I ’ve got . ”
140038	140048	140072	140072	his	348	“ Oh , Dad . You love your job . ”
140049	140055	140010	140010	He	348	“ I love you more . ”
140056	140064	140065	140065	Gideon	418	“ What will you do for work ? ”
140126	140136	140141	140141	his	317	“ That ’s what I wanted to talk about , ”
140146	140154	140155	140155	Gideon	418	“ Eva needs a dedicated security chief , ”
140159	140179	140155	140155	Gideon	418	“ I ’ve got Angus and Raúl stretched to their limits and my wife needs her own security team . ”
140193	140200	140185	140185	I	0	“ What ? No , Gideon . ”
140205	140230	140201	140201	His	317	“ Why not ? It would be ideal . There ’s no one I could trust more to protect you than your own father . ”
140231	140267	140185	140185	I	0	“ Because it ’s … weird . Okay ? Dad ’s his own man . It would be awkward to have my father on my husband ’s payroll . It ’s just … not right . ”
140268	140280	140281	140281	he	317	“ Angus is the closest I ’ve had to a father , ”
140285	140293	140281	140281	he	317	“ and he works the same job . ”
140301	140336	140281	140281	he	317	“ I do n’t think any less of him . And Chris , as the head of a company in which I have controlling interest , also could be said to work for me . ”
140337	140342	140343	140343	I	0	“ That ’s different , ”
140347	140350	140351	140352	My dad	348	“ Eva . ”
140360	140373	140351	140352	My dad	348	“ If I can handle it , you should be able to . ”
140381	140397	140374	140374	I	0	“ Are you serious ? Were you thinking about this before he brought it up ? ”
140404	140438	140398	140398	He	348	“ I ’ve been thinking about it since he called me about … your mom . Cross is right : There ’s no one I trust more than myself to keep you safe . ”
140439	140456	140457	140457	I	0	“ Safe from what ? What happened last night … It ’s not an everyday thing . ”
140499	140538	140539	140539	His	2345	“ Eva , I ’ve seen you more on television , the Internet , and in magazines than I have in person this entire last year and you were living in San Diego for most of that time . ”
140543	140577	140539	140539	His	2345	“ God willing you ’ll never be at risk , but I ca n’t take that chance . Besides , Cross is planning on hiring someone anyway . Might as well be me . ”
140578	140582	140583	140583	I	0	“ Were you ? ”
140593	140603	140590	140590	He	2345	“ Yes . It ’s been on my mind . ”
140604	140611	140583	140583	I	0	“ I do n’t like it . ”
140612	140619	140620	140620	His	2345	“ I ’m sorry , angel . ”
140641	140662	140635	140636	My dad	348	“ I wo n’t accept any perks or compensation outside the scope of what you ’re paying your other men . ”
140683	140711	140663	140663	Gideon	418	“ Angus and Raúl both agreed to let me share their salaries with you . I ’ve also laid out what you can expect , to start . ”
140712	140719	140720	140720	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe this , ”
140723	140737	140720	140720	I	0	“ You were this far along and did n’t say anything to me ? ”
140738	140771	140663	140663	Gideon	418	“ I worked on it earlier this morning . It has n’t come up before now and I was n’t going to say anything unless your father mentioned moving to the city . ”
140801	140807	140784	140785	My dad	418	“ Is this for real ? ”
140808	140842	140843	140843	Gideon	418	“ Consider that Angus has been with me for more years of my life than not . He also has considerable covert and military training . In short , he ’s earned it . ”
140852	140886	140843	140843	Gideon	418	“ Raúl has been with me a shorter amount of time , so he ’s not where Angus is — yet . But he also has a broad range of training and skills . ”
140901	140907	140894	140894	he	418	“ Okay . This is … ”
140908	140968	140843	140843	Gideon	418	“ More than you were likely expecting , but that spreadsheet gives you the info you need to gauge the offered compensation compared to my other chiefs . You can see that it ’s fair . It ’s predicated on the expectation that you will consent to further training and attain the necessary permits , licenses , and registrations . ”
141001	141005	140994	140994	he	418	“ All right . ”
141006	141017	141018	141018	Gideon	418	“ You ’ll note that a housing allowance is included , ”
141036	141059	141018	141018	Gideon	418	“ If you would like , there ’s a unit next door to Eva ’s former apartment that ’s available and furnished . ”
141104	141111	141112	141113	my dad	418	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
141116	141123	141124	141124	Gideon	418	“ Another thing to think about , ”
141127	141181	141124	141124	Gideon	418	“ is the reality of your daughter being my wife . Certainly we would be mindful of your personal role in Eva ’s life and be respectful of that . But respecting your place as her father means we wo n’t be brazen . It does n’t mean we wo n’t be intimate . ”
141216	141230	141204	141205	my father	418	“ I ’ll keep that in mind while I ’m thinking things over . ”
141237	141250	141231	141231	Gideon	418	“ All right . Was there anything else we needed to cover ? ”
141257	141262	141251	141252	My dad	418	“ Not right now . ”
141279	141298	141299	141300	My husband	418	“ You know where to find me , angel , when you ’re ready to tear into me . ”
141307	141320	141299	141300	My husband	418	“ In the meantime , let ’s get some food into you . ”
141629	141634	141623	141624	my mom	345	“ Hi , Trey . ”
141635	141683	141739	141739	I	0	“ Eva . I … I probably should n’t be intruding at a time like this , but I saw the news and I was calling you before I thought about it being a bad idea . I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am . ”
141708	141716	141684	141684	I	0	“ I appreciate you thinking of me . ”
141717	141738	141739	141739	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe what happened . If there ’s anything I can do , please let me know . ”
141781	141829	141830	141830	He	2143	“ Look , Trey , I do n’t want to lay a guilt trip on you , but you should know that my mother meant a lot to Cary . She was like a surrogate mom to him . He ’s really hurting a lot right now . ”
141833	141841	141830	141830	He	2143	“ I ’m sorry to hear that . ”
141842	141851	141852	141852	I	0	“ I meant to call you … before . ”
141860	141925	141852	141852	I	0	“ To see how you ’re doing , but also — well , there ’s more . I wanted to tell you that I know you have to do what ’s best for you . That said , if you ’re thinking at all that you might want something with Cary , you should make up your mind quickly . The door is closing . ”
141926	141936	141937	141937	he	0	“ Let me guess . He ’s seeing someone , ”
141941	141972	141852	141852	I	0	“ No , just the opposite . He ’s taking some time for himself and reevaluating what he wants . You know he broke it off with Tatiana , right ? ”
141973	141980	141852	141852	I	0	“ That ’s what he says . ”
141981	142001	141852	141852	I	0	“ If you do n’t trust him to tell the truth , it ’s good you broke things off . ”
142002	142007	142008	142008	He	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
142015	142023	142008	142008	He	0	“ That ’s not what I meant . ”
142024	142054	141852	141852	I	0	“ Cary ’s healing , Trey . Pretty soon , he ’s going to be ready to move on . It ’s just something you need to think about . ”
142055	142075	142008	142008	He	0	“ All I ’ve done is think about it . I still do n’t know what the answer is . ”
142084	142114	142076	142076	I	0	“ Maybe you ’re asking the wrong question . Are you happier with him or without him ? Figure that out and I think the rest will become clear . ”
142115	142121	141852	141852	I	0	“ Thank you , Eva . ”
142122	142160	142161	142161	I	0	“ For what it ’s worth , you and I kinda took the same route . Gideon and I always said we were going to make it work , but that was … I do n’t know … ”
142168	142205	142161	142161	I	0	“ Bravado . Stubbornness . That was part of our problem , we knew it was a house of cards . We were n’t taking the steps to make us solid . Does that make sense ? ”

149380	149387	149367	149367	I	0	“ I ’m the lucky one . ”
149388	149421	149333	149333	he	418	“ You ’ve changed my life , Eva . And you did the impossible : you transformed me . I like who I am now . I never thought that would happen . ”
149422	149428	149429	149429	I	0	“ You were always wonderful , ”
149433	149448	149429	149429	I	0	“ I loved you when I saw you . I love you more now . ”
149449	149463	149464	149464	He	0	“ There are n’t words to tell you what you mean to me . ”
149470	149504	149464	149464	He	0	“ But I hope that when you see this ring on your hand , you ’ll remember that you shine as brightly as diamonds in my life and you ’re infinitely more precious . ”
149533	149545	149518	149518	I	0	“ You ’re the best thing that ever happened to me . ”
149671	149676	149677	149677	I	0	“ This is perfect , ”
149730	149735	149736	149736	I	0	“ I love you ! ”
149768	149771	149765	149765	he	317	“ Crossfire . ”
150063	150066	150054	150055	her mother	698	“ Cross . ”
150155	150161	150162	150162	He	2261	“ I need a minute . ”
150175	150180	150162	150162	He	2261	“ Lead the way . ”
150267	150308	150260	150260	He	110	“ Mrs. Stanton left behind over twenty - five years ’ worth of handwritten journals and a backup computer drive with electronic journal entries . She asked that I pass them along to Eva in the event of her death . ”
150318	150327	150315	150315	I	0	“ I ’ll make sure she gets them . ”
150400	150415	150416	150416	he	110	“ You ’ll need to judge the best time to give them to her , ”
150419	150430	150416	150416	he	110	“ And you may decide she should never see them . ”
150431	150435	150437	150437	I	0	“ I see . ”
150455	150458	150459	150459	Clancy	110	“ Regardless , ”
150463	150498	150459	150459	Clancy	110	“ you now have a new financial responsibility that you ’ll have to take over on Lauren ’s behalf . It ’s not inconsiderable , but you wo n’t have any trouble managing it . ”
150521	150532	150518	150518	he	110	“ You started researching her story after the Tramells died . ”
150533	150543	150518	150518	he	110	“ But you ’d cleaned most of it up . ”
150561	150634	150518	150518	he	110	“ What I could . I dug into her past when Mr. Stanton became serious about their relationship . When I confronted her , she told me what I ’m about to tell you — none of which is known to Mr. Stanton . I ’d like to keep it that way . He was happy . Who she was did n’t affect him , so he does n’t need to know . ”
150659	150692	150654	150654	Clancy	110	“ You ’ll get more out of the journals . I have n’t read them , but Lauren ’s story is certainly more compelling than the dry facts I ’ll give you . ”
150693	150700	150654	150654	Clancy	110	“ I understand . Go ahead . ”
150701	150764	150654	150654	Clancy	110	“ Lauren Kittrie was raised in a small town on the outskirts of Austin , Texas . Her family was poor . Her mother abandoned her and her twin sister with their father , who worked as a hand on a local ranch . He was a busy man , not much interested in or capable of raising two beautiful headstrong girls . ”
150791	150797	150798	150798	he	0	“ As you can imagine , ”
150801	150843	150798	150798	he	0	“ they got noticed . Toward the end of high school , they ’d caught the attention of a group of wealthy college students from Austin . Punks , with a dangerous sense of entitlement . The leader was Jackson Tramell . ”
150847	150852	150798	150798	he	0	“ She married him . ”
150853	150858	150859	150859	he	0	“ That was later , ”
150863	150918	150859	150859	he	0	“ Lauren was savvy about men from the outset . She wanted out of the life her parents had , but she knew trouble when she saw it . She rebuffed him , many times . Her sister , Katherine , was n’t as smart . She thought Tramell could be her ticket out . ”
150926	150937	150919	150919	Unease	293	“ How much of this do I need to hear ? ”
150938	151014	151074	151074	Restless	294	“ Against Lauren ’s advice , Katherine went out with him . When she did n’t come home either that night or the next day , Lauren called the police . Katherine was discovered by a local farmer in his field , barely conscious thanks to a toxic combination of street drugs and alcohol . She ’d been violently assaulted . Although it was n’t proven , it was suspected that multiple individuals were involved . ”
151015	151018	150919	150919	Unease	293	“ Jesus . ”
151019	151026	151027	151027	Clancy	110	“ Katherine was in bad shape , ”
151031	151073	151027	151027	Clancy	110	“ The hallucinogenic drugs in her system combined with the physical trauma of gang rape caused permanent brain damage . She needed round - the - clock care for an indefinite period of time , something their father could n’t afford . ”
151093	151182	151027	151027	Clancy	110	“ Lauren went to the Tramells , confronted them about their son and what she suspected he ’d done . He denied it and no one was able to prove a connection to him , owing to a lack of physical evidence at that time . But he saw an opportunity and took it . Lauren was the one he ’d wanted , so he got his parents to cover the expenses of basic care for Katherine in return for Lauren herself and her silence about the assault . ”
151252	151283	151246	151246	Clancy	110	“ Jackson wanted sex . Lauren negotiated with his parents to secure marriage , which she thought would provide some sort of guarantee that Katherine would always be looked after . ”
151302	151321	151284	151284	I	0	“ For a span of months , the situation between Lauren and Jackson was stable . They lived — ”
151322	151325	151284	151284	I	0	“ Stable ? ”
151334	151356	151284	151284	I	0	“ She just about sold herself to the man who orchestrated the gang rape of her twin sister . My God … ”
151401	151407	151408	151408	Clancy	110	“ The situation was stable , ”
151411	151417	151408	151408	Clancy	110	“ until she met Victor . ”
151446	151504	151442	151442	His	110	“ She became pregnant with Eva . When Jackson found out the baby was n’t his , he tried to take care of it — with his fists . Although they lived in his parents ’ home , the older Tramells never interceded during arguments between the two . Lauren feared for the life of her child . ”
151505	151510	151511	151511	I	0	“ She shot him . ”
151532	151543	151511	151511	I	0	“ The undetermined manner of death — she killed him . ”
151572	151588	151567	151567	I	0	“ The Tramells helped Lauren get away with it . They had to . Why ? ”
151589	151667	151544	151544	Clancy	110	“ During the time Lauren was with Jackson , she quietly documented anything and everything she could use against him later . The Tramells valued their reputation — and the reputation of their debutante daughter , Monica — and they just wanted Lauren , and all the problems she ’d caused , gone . Lauren left with the clothes on her back and the understanding that , moving forward , Katherine ’s care was entirely her responsibility . ”
151668	151676	151677	151677	I	0	“ So it was all for nothing , ”
151680	151688	151677	151677	I	0	“ She was right where she started . ”
151697	151703	151677	151677	I	0	“ Katherine ’s still alive . ”
151785	151819	151774	151774	Clancy	110	“ And as I mentioned at the outset , Katherine ’s care is now your financial responsibility . Whether you disclose any of this to Eva is something you ’ll have to weigh . ”
151824	151833	151820	151820	I	0	“ Why are you trusting me with this ? ”
151839	151894	151834	151834	He	110	“ I saw you throw yourself over Eva when Hall opened fire . That , along with how you dealt with Barker , tells me you ’ll do anything to protect her . If you think it ’s in her best interests to know , you ’ll tell her when the time is right . ”
151918	151921	151927	151927	Eva	2431	“ Hey . ”
151942	151949	151950	151950	she	2431	“ What are you doing here ? ”
151962	151980	151950	151950	she	2431	“ I was looking all over for you . Clancy had to tell me where you were . ”
151981	151987	151988	151988	I	0	“ I had a drink , ”
151998	152003	152012	152012	she	2431	“ How many drinks ? ”
152019	152038	152012	152012	she	2431	“ You ’ve been in here awhile , ace . We have to take Dad to the airport . ”
152148	152153	152154	152154	I	0	“ I love you , ”
152165	152169	152170	152170	she	345	“ You okay ? ”
152179	152182	152183	152183	I	0	“ Yes . ”
152194	152199	152183	152183	I	0	“ Let ’s go . ”
152201	152211	152183	152183	I	0	“ WHAT AN ODD CHOICE for a honeymoon hotel . ”
152265	152272	152273	152273	I	0	“ It ’s a private joke , ”
152296	152315	152273	152273	I	0	“ I told Gideon I have a Tarzan fantasy , so he found us a luxury tree house . ”

152377	152384	152371	152372	My mother	345	“ I wo n’t even comment . ”
152414	152444	152402	152402	she	345	“ I ’m so glad your father has decided to move to New York . It gives me peace of mind to know he ’ll be there for you . ”
152445	152458	152404	152404	her	345	“ Yeah , well … I ’m getting used to the idea . ”
152522	152530	152531	152531	I	0	“ I ’ve been reading your diaries , ”
152534	152538	152531	152531	I	0	“ I know . ”
152554	152568	152544	152544	I	0	“ Why did n’t you share any of your past with me before ? ”
152569	152574	152575	152575	Her	345	“ I meant to . ”
152581	152618	152575	152575	Her	345	“ When you were little , I planned to one day . Then Nathan … happened , and you were recovering from that . And you met Gideon . I always thought there would be time . ”

But then I realized her mind protected her from that one night of hell . She does n’t remember it . And as simple as her thoughts are now , she finds a childlike joy in everything . ”

154289	154322	154323	154323	I	0	“ I think it ’s sending the wrong message . You know , the overwhelmed wife / mother / businesswoman can only find quiet time by distracting the family with the GenTen . ”
