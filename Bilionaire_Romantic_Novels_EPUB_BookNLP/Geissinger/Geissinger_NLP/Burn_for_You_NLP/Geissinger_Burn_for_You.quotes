231	242	243	243	I	1777	“ Garlic is for vampires , not werewolves , Eeny , ”
317	328	343	343	Hoyt	267	“ That ai n’t no werewolf , or no vampire , ”
408	417	419	419	Hoyt	267	“ I recognize his face from the papers , ”
421	437	419	419	Hoyt	267	“ That there is the boodoo tête de cabri , Mr. Boudreaux Bourbon Jr. himself . ”
438	449	450	450	I	1777	“ Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit , ”
724	736	737	737	I	1777	“ How did I miss his name on the reservations list ? ”
740	761	737	737	I	1777	“ If I ’d known he was coming , I ’d have made sure to give him the best table ! ”
765	794	762	762	Eeny	954	“ Pepper just seated a family of eight at the best table . It ’s an anniversary party , boo . They ’ll probably be there for hours . ”
842	849	850	850	I	1777	“ Y’all get back to work ! ”
937	946	947	947	I	1777	“ Henri , I need more pepper jelly ! ”
1151	1158	1143	1143	I	1777	“ Pepper ! What on earth — ”
1159	1175	1177	1177	Pepper	47	“ That egg - suckin ’ son of a motherless goat can kiss my ass ! ”
1321	1327	1315	1315	I	1777	“ What ’s going on ? ”
1337	1345	1328	1328	Pepper	47	“ That man who just came in — ”
1350	1354	1346	1346	My	1777	“ Mr. Boudreaux ? ”
1365	1555	1355	1355	Pepper	47	“ He said he wanted a table , and I told him unfortunately we were fully committed , and he said what the hell did that mean , and I tried to nicely explain that we did n’t have any available tables , and then he said all snottylike , ‘ Do n’t you know who I am ! ’ and demanded I find him a table , and I said I just told you there are n’t any tables available , sir , and there ’s a waiting list a mile long , but he cut me off and said — really mean , too , he ’s like a crossbred dog!—that his name was all over our menu and if I did n’t get him a table , he ’d make sure our name was all over the papers , and not in a good way , either , because he knew all the press ! So it was like he threatened me , and when I got upset , he growled at me to stop sniveling ! Sniveling ! Does n’t that just dill my pickle ! ”
1609	1626	1629	1629	she	47	“ All right , Pepper , first thing — calm down . Take a deep breath . ”
1632	1681	1629	1629	she	47	“ Good . Now go back out there and tell him — nicely , please — that the owner will be out to speak with him in a few minutes . Then show him to the bar and have Gilly give him a drink . On the house . ”
1682	1685	1627	1627	Grudgingly	53	“ But — ”
1686	1689	1690	1690	I	1777	“ Pepper , ”
1697	1783	1690	1690	I	1777	“ That is Jackson Boudreaux . Not only could the man buy and sell this town a hundred times over , he ’s no doubt connected with all kinds of highfalutin folks , which means that if he feels mistreated , all those people are gon na hear about it , which is n’t good for business . I ’m sorry he was n’t nice to you , but you need to learn how to handle peacocks like that without getting your own feathers ruffled . ”
1796	1832	1790	1790	I	1777	“ And remember , the biggest bullies are the biggest babies inside . So just picture him in a nappy with a bottle stuck in his mouth , and do n’t let him intimidate you . ”
1844	1866	1840	1840	Pepper	47	“ I ’d rather picture him with a bucket of crawdads shoved up his tight ass in place of that stick . ”
1879	1884	1885	1885	I	1777	“ Charming , Pepper , ”
1889	1893	1885	1885	I	1777	“ Now go . ”
2288	2298	2281	2282	Jackson Boudreaux	487	“ I do n’t like to be kept waiting . ”
2429	2482	2426	2426	he	315	“ Your hostess is incompetent . The music is too loud . And your drink menu is pretentious . ‘ Romeo and Julep ? ’ ‘ The Last of the Mojitos ? ’ Awful . If I were going on first impressions , I ’d guess your food is awful , too . ”
2502	2539	2493	2493	My	1777	“ And if I were going on first impressions , I ’d guess you were one of the homeless panhandlers who harass the tourists over on the boulevard , and throw you out of my restaurant . ”
2568	2580	2559	2559	I	1777	“ Bianca Hardwick . Pleased to meet you , Mr. Boudreaux . ”
2608	2621	2625	2625	he	320	“ Miss Hardwick . It ’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance . ”
2635	2648	2625	2625	he	320	“ Call me Bianca , please . I apologize for the wait . ”
2662	2680	2649	2649	Jackson	487	“ If I wanted to call you Bianca , I would have . Where ’s my table ? ”
2753	2761	2749	2751	this arrogant jerk	323	“ Oh , it ’s here somewhere . ”
2780	2820	2772	2772	I	1777	“ As soon as a table becomes available , we ’ll squeeze you in where we can . So nice of you to drop by . Now if you ’ll excuse me , I have to get back to — ”
2821	2825	2826	2826	he	320	“ Miss Hardwick , ”
2836	2845	2826	2826	he	320	“ Where . Is . My . Table ? ”
3023	3097	3019	3019	I	1777	“ Maybe you were right about the music being too loud . It must have obstructed your hearing , because I just told you that we ’d get you a table as soon as one becomes available . Or perhaps you ’d prefer I throw someone out ? Maybe that nice elderly couple by the piano ? They look much less deserving of enjoying their meal than you do , am I right ? ”
3192	3196	3189	3189	He	59	“ How long ? ”
3208	3227	3189	3189	He	59	“ You made my hostess cry . How long of a wait do you think that ’s worth ? ”
3235	3264	3232	3232	he	59	“ I ’m not a man to be toyed with , Miss Hardwick . As I told your hysterical hostess , I know all the prominent food critics — ”
3268	3274	3265	3265	I	1777	“ How lucky for them ! ”
3275	3302	3265	3265	I	1777	“ — and as my name is featured prominently on most of the dishes on your menu , I ’d expect you ’d be more accommodating — ”
3303	3315	3265	3265	I	1777	“ Technically , Boudreaux is your family ’s name , correct ? ”
3316	3333	3265	3265	I	1777	“ — because I make it my business to protect anything with my name on it — ”
3334	3347	3265	3265	I	1777	“ Excuse me , how did my menu suddenly become your property ? ”
3348	3394	3265	3265	I	1777	“ — and if your food is as bad as everything else I ’ve experienced so far , including your attitude , I wo n’t hesitate to speak with my industry contacts , along with my attorneys about your infringement on my family ’s trademark . ”
3407	3422	3400	3400	I	1777	“ You ’re threatening to sue me ? You ca n’t possibly be serious ! ”
3485	3531	3466	3466	I	1777	“ I do n’t care who you are , Mr. Boudreaux , or how much bad press you can bring me , or how many overpaid attorneys you have . Your manners are atrocious . Growl at me again and I will throw you out . ”
3548	3579	3532	3532	I	1777	“ You ’ll get the next available table . In the meantime , have another drink on me . Maybe the alcohol will turn you back into a human being . ”
3766	3778	3763	3763	Eeny	954	“ Looks like that boy has n’t eaten in a year ! ”
3783	3794	3779	3779	I	1777	“ Only the souls of all who ’ve displeased him . ”
3798	3838	3795	3795	She	954	“ I see LaDonna Quinn would like to give him somethin’ else to chew on besides your spicy baby back ribs . Lawd , that dress she ’s wearin ’ is so tight you can almost see her religion . ”
3881	3894	3896	3896	Eeny	954	“ Ooh — and here comes Marybeth Lee struttin ’ her stuff ! ”
3969	3988	3966	3966	I	1777	“ Maybe he ’s gay . I ’ve never seen a man immune to Marybeth ’s double Ds . ”
3992	4027	3989	3989	Eeny	954	“ Judgin ’ by the way his eyes were glued to your behind when you were stormin ’ away from him at the bar , I ’d say that boy is definitely not gay . ”
4033	4041	4030	4030	I	1777	“ He was looking at my ass ? ”
4053	4077	4042	4042	Eeny	954	“ What , you need to introduce a man to your mama before he ’s allowed to get an eyeful of your booty ? ”
4081	4096	4078	4078	I	1777	“ No , that ’s not — he ’s just — what a jerk ! ”
4132	4145	4118	4118	She	954	“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t think he ’s handsome . ”
4149	4170	4146	4146	I	1777	“ Handsome ? How could I tell ? It ’s impossible to see past the forked tongue and the horns ! ”
4176	4181	4171	4171	Eeny	954	“ Mm - hmm . ”
4182	4195	4196	4196	I	1777	“ Do n’t you have some work to be doing , Eeny ? ”
4210	4246	4207	4207	She	954	“ I ’m just sayin ’ , if LaDonna and that scandalmonger Marybeth are spendin ’ so much time throwin ’ their hussy selves in his direction , it ai n’t because he ’s ugly . ”
4247	4275	4171	4171	Eeny	954	“ No , it ’s because he ’s stinking rich . And besides , you called him a werewolf . You ca n’t think he ’s handsome ! ”
4282	4303	4276	4276	She	954	“ Oh , honey . I think all this time you ’ve been without a man has made you blind . ”
4325	4336	4317	4317	I	1777	“ Lord , why do I even employ these people ? ”
4341	4377	4337	4337	Hoyt	267	“ I ’m guessin ’ that ’s one of them ‘ moot ’ questions , ’cause we both know you would n’t have a dessert menu worth eatin ’ if it was n’t for me — ”
4378	4393	4394	4395	bossed Eeny	954	“ Oh , shut your pie hole and get back to work , Hoyt ! ”
4405	4432	4394	4395	bossed Eeny	954	“ I swear , if I have to hear one more time about your mad skills with pastry dough , I ’ll keel over and die ! ”
4466	4494	4433	4433	Hoyt	267	“ Aw , c’m on now dawlin ’ . You know it ai n’t my dough - kneadin ’ skills that make you weak in the knees . ”
4495	4498	4500	4500	Eeny	954	“ Ack , ”
4506	4514	4500	4500	Eeny	954	“ You ’re delusional , old man . ”
4519	4543	4515	4515	Hoyt	267	“ And you , suggie bee , are a sassy li’l blackberry . C’m on over here and give old Hoyt a kiss . ”
4544	4553	4555	4555	Eeny	954	“ Pffft ! Do n’t hold your breath ! ”
4572	4581	4555	4555	Eeny	954	“ Bianca ! He ’s asking for you ! ”
4673	4687	4670	4670	I	1777	“ What does he want ? Did Marlene already bring him the check ? ”
4688	4702	4703	4703	Pepper	47	“ Yes ! And then he called me over and gave me this ! ”
4714	4746	4747	4747	She	47	“ And when I asked what it was for , he said all meanlike , ‘ I do n’t like to see a woman cry . ’ Can you believe that ? ”
4752	4781	4747	4747	She	47	“ If I ’d known I ’d get a Benjamin as a tip if I cried , I would ’ve been bawling on the customers from day one ! ”
4883	4886	4887	4887	I	1777	“ Eeny , ”
4899	4917	4887	4887	I	1777	“ make sure these get out to table six . I ’ll be back in two shakes . ”
4918	4923	4924	4924	she	347	“ Uh - oh , ”
4932	4952	4924	4924	she	347	“ Somebody get the fire extinguisher . I think poor Mr. Boudreaux is about to go up in flames . ”
4956	4961	4953	4953	I	1777	“ Poor my patootie , ”
4998	5005	4995	4995	I	1777	“ You asked to see me ? ”
5116	5125	5108	5108	he	344	“ There ’s an error on my check . ”

5182	5203	5133	5133	His	344	“ Believe me , I ’m perfectly aware how long you ’ve been here and how much you ’ve eaten . ”
5279	5296	5270	5270	he	344	condescension—“My opinion of you and your restaurant ca n’t be swayed with freebies , Miss Hardwick . ”
5330	5405	5327	5327	I	1777	“ I ’m not interested in your opinion , Mr. Boudreaux . Your meal is on the house because I love your family ’s bourbon and it inspired me to create this menu , which I happen to be very proud of , and which has made a lot of people happy . I would ’ve comped you even if you did n’t act like the sun comes up just to hear you crow . ”
5445	5451	5441	5441	He	344	“ I insist on paying — ”
5452	5460	5441	5441	He	344	“ I ’m not taking your money . ”
5616	5620	5621	5621	he	344	“ Miss Hardwick , ”

5664	5687	5646	5646	Boy	354	“ And you , Mr. Boudreaux , are the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard . Have yourself a nice evening . ”
5917	5925	5927	5927	Rayford	1721	“ How was the food , sir ? ”
5945	5948	5942	5942	I	1777	“ Adequate . ”
5970	6003	6004	6004	He	1721	“ Her mama was a great cook , too . Davina ’s restaurant was around for , oh , twenty years I think before Hurricane Katrina blew through and wiped it out . ”
6007	6081	6004	6004	He	1721	“ I had many a meal there back in the day . Every time I came to visit my baby brother , I made sure to stop by . Never forgot Davina ’s jambalaya . It was like havin’ a mouthful of heaven . And it was n’t only the food that kept me comin ’ back . Miss Davina Hardwick was one of the finest - lookin ’ women I ever seen . ”
6621	6630	6632	6632	Rayford	1721	“ You feelin ’ all right , sir ? ”
6643	6649	6632	6632	Rayford	1721	“ Of course . Why ? ”
6650	6662	6667	6667	Rayford	1721	“ Because you look a little funny . Sick , maybe . ”
6716	6721	6722	6722	I	1777	“ Damn , girl , ”
6733	6750	6722	6722	I	1777	“ Those are n’t bags under your eyes , that ’s a full set of luggage . ”
7092	7095	7096	7096	she	390	“ Well , ”
7099	7125	7096	7096	she	390	“ I know you do n’t look so rough because of a man , chère , so come on in and tell me the story . ”
7126	7135	7096	7096	she	390	“ Actually it is because of a man . ”
7373	7388	7368	7369	my mother	390	“ Well let me put on my glasses so I can hear you better ! ”
7451	7460	7461	7461	I	1777	“ It ’s a long story , Mama , ”
7467	7473	7461	7461	I	1777	“ And not worth retelling . ”
7492	7497	7477	7477	Her	390	“ No saucy bits ? ”
7498	7503	7461	7461	I	1777	“ Not even one . ”
7523	7531	7508	7508	she	390	“ Did you have breakfast , chère ? ”
7535	7541	7532	7532	I	1777	“ Coffee and some aspirin . ”
7542	7551	7552	7552	she	390	“ That ’s not breakfast , silly child ! ”
7555	7566	7552	7552	she	390	“ Get your skinny behind in this house and eat ! ”
7643	7657	7658	7658	she	390	“ I made collard greens , shrimp and grits , and Cajun benedict , ”
7664	7683	7658	7658	she	390	“ And I ’ve got okra gumbo and my famous jambalaya simmerin ’ on the stove for later . ”

7826	7833	7835	7836	my mother	390	“ Leave him be , Bianca , ”
7841	7854	7835	7836	my mother	390	“ C’m on now , I ’m making you up a plate . ”
7929	7941	7926	7926	I	1777	“ Another sleepover ? Is this getting serious with you two ? ”
7957	7986	7987	7987	She	390	“ No man could ever compete with your father , chère , God bless his soul , but that does n’t mean I ’ll stop them from trying . ”
7991	8002	7987	7987	She	390	“ And my word , the Colonel is certainly trying . ”
8003	8027	8076	8079	The “ fool boy	79	“ Ugh . It ’s depressing that you get more action than I do . I can already feel the emotional scars forming . ”
8028	8075	7987	7987	She	390	“ Please , child , you ’re not that fragile . And how many times do I have to tell you to get back out there ? Do n’t let that fool boy put a hex on your love life . He is n’t worth it ! ”
8077	8080	8087	8087	Trace	79	“ fool boy ”
8178	8186	8164	8164	I	1777	“ So what did Doc Halloran say ? ”
8207	8225	8204	8204	she	1754	“ Just what I told you he ’d say , baby . I ’m right as rain . ”
8229	8242	8226	8226	I	1777	“ But you ’ve had that cough for months now , Mama . ”

8345	8354	8331	8331	She	1754	“ Just a side effect of getting old . ”
8360	8390	8355	8355	I	1777	“ Am I hearing things , or did the fabulous Miss Davina Hardwick just say the word old ? I did n’t think it was even in your vocabulary ! ”
8391	8396	8397	8398	My mother	1754	“ Hush , you ! ”
8410	8418	8397	8398	My mother	1754	“ Or the whole neighborhood will hear ! ”

8535	8554	8524	8525	My mother	1754	“ Nothing for you to be worrying about , just girl talk . Sit yourself down and eat . ”
8566	8585	8558	8558	he	408	“ I ’ve already got a belly full of sweetness from spending the night with you , woman . ”
8617	8632	8605	8606	my mother	1754	“ Why you silver - tongued devil . Whatever will I do with you ? ”
8681	8691	8692	8692	he	408	“ I can think of one or two things ! ”
8718	8724	8725	8725	she	1754	“ Only one or two ? ”
8734	8746	8725	8725	she	1754	“ I thought you had more imagination than that , tahyo ! ”
8768	8779	8758	8758	I	1777	“ Someone please kill me . Just kill me now . ”
8780	8804	8805	8805	Mama	1754	“ I told you not to talk to yourself , child , you sound like one of the hobos over on the boulevard ! ”

8961	8982	8957	8958	The Colonel	408	“ This would n’t have anything to do with your visit from a certain Mr. Jackson Boudreaux , would it ? ”
8983	8987	8957	8958	The Colonel	408	“ Jackson Boudreaux ! ”
9000	9024	8957	8958	The Colonel	408	“ Good Lord in heaven , what were you doing with him ? I hear that boy ’s meaner than a wet panther ! ”

9150	9162	9163	9164	my mother	390	“ Keep it up and I ’ll cancel your birth certificate ! ”
9167	9175	9176	9176	I	1777	“ — rabid crawdad in my life , ”
9206	9231	9202	9203	The Colonel	408	“ You did n’t think the boy got the nickname ‘ the Beast ’ by bein ’ all rainbows and butterflies , did you ? ”
9308	9314	9315	9315	Mama	1754	“ Snapped his head off ? ”
9370	9405	9357	9357	she	1754	“ Just goes to show that money is no substitute for class , chère . The true measure of a man is how he treats those less fortunate than him , make no mistake . ”
9477	9479	9473	9474	my mother	390	“ down ”
9490	9492	9473	9474	my mother	390	“ down ”
9562	9576	9577	9577	I	1777	“ Anyway it does n’t matter because I ’ll never see him again , ”
9584	9604	9577	9577	I	1777	“ Now I really need to get a move on or I ’ll be late for the produce shipment — ”
9631	9634	9635	9635	I	1777	“ Mama ! ”
9662	9667	9668	9668	she	1754	“ I ’m fine , ”
9675	9691	9668	9668	she	1754	“ I ’m just a little dry , chère , I need a glass of — ”

9810	9816	9817	9817	she	1754	“ Thank you , baby , ”
9826	9831	9817	9817	she	1754	“ That ’s better . ”
9902	9939	9890	9890	I	1777	“ Mama . You better spit out the truth right now or I ’m gon na cream your corn , as Daddy used to say . What did Doc Halloran really tell you about that cough ? ”
9984	9995	9980	9980	she	390	“ Owen , would you please give us a moment ? ”
10019	10025	10010	10011	The Colonel	408	“ Of course , Davina . ”
10287	10291	10292	10292	I	1777	“ Fuck yes , ”
10300	10305	10292	10292	I	1777	“ Do n’t stop . ”
10466	10473	10474	10474	she	390	“ Oh , you like that , ”
10478	10488	10474	10474	she	390	“ Let ’s find out what else you like . ”
10751	10754	10755	10755	she	390	“ Jax , ”
10897	10901	10902	10902	she	390	“ Oh God , ”
10905	10914	10902	10902	she	390	“ God , yes . Please — Jax — ”
10915	10921	10922	10922	I	1777	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
11056	11059	11060	11060	I	1777	“ Bianca ! ”
11187	11192	11193	11193	I	1777	“ Jesus , Jackson , ”
11216	11224	11193	11193	I	1777	“ You need to get out more . ”
11462	11468	11470	11470	Rayford	1721	“ Mornin ’ , sir , ”

11611	11649	11597	11597	I	1777	“ Yes , sir , Charlie ’s just gettin ’ him cleaned up now . They should both be down for breakfast in a few minutes . Will you be dinin ’ at home this mornin ’ ? ”
11703	11710	11711	11711	I	1777	“ I do n’t know yet . ”
11714	11719	11711	11711	I	1777	“ Does Charlie — ? ”
11720	11726	11727	11727	he	1721	“ She does , sir , ”
11743	11787	11727	11727	he	1721	“ I asked her yesterday if she ’d be able to fill in for a day or two until we could find a new chef . I already rang the service , so we should have a few applicants to interview by tomorrow . ”
11797	11822	11727	11727	he	1721	“ I doubt Charlie has Bianca Hardwick ’s talent , but she can probably make a sandwich for you and somethin’ appropriate for Cody . ”
11889	11892	11881	11881	I	1777	“ What ? ”
11899	11906	11881	11881	I	1777	“ Good morning , Mr. Boudreaux ! ”
11989	12040	11986	11986	He	92	“ I ’m just calling to go over some last - minute details for the event on the fifteenth . Most importantly , I ’d like to speak with your chef so we can finalize the menu and have the menu cards printed up . Is now a good time ? ”
12049	12052	12053	12053	I	1777	“ No , ”
12056	12066	12071	12071	genius	477	“ it is n’t . I ’ll . . . ”
12073	12088	12071	12071	genius	477	“ I ’ll fax the menu over to you no later than tomorrow night . ”
12089	12094	12096	12096	Matthew	92	“ Oh , great ! ”
12111	12152	12153	12153	He	92	“ Looking forward to it ! The donors are always so keen to see what ’s on the menu . You would n’t believe how seriously this group takes food . The better the food , the better the donations ! ”
12156	12168	12153	12153	He	92	“ Oh — and the wine list ! I completely forgot ! ”
12195	12206	12207	12207	I	1777	“ I ’ll have it all over to you tomorrow ! ”
12256	12272	12253	12253	I	1777	“ Where do you think Gregory would ’ve left his notes about the benefit dinner ? ”
12293	12303	12304	12304	he	1721	“ He did n’t leave any notes , sir , ”
12307	12347	12348	12348	Rayford	1721	“ He packed up everything he had — recipe books , notebooks , them fancy Japanese knives — and cleared outta here like a scalded cat . Do n’t expect he ’ll be takin ’ your calls , either , ”
12352	12380	12348	12348	Rayford	1721	“ seein ’ as how he said you were colder than a penguin ’s balls and he would n’t piss on you if you were on fire . ”
12420	12423	12424	12424	I	1777	“ Fuck , ”
12494	12501	12503	12503	Eeny	954	“ You all right , boo ? ”
12580	12586	12619	12619	Chuckling	94	“ I ’m . . . ”
12604	12618	12600	12600	I	1777	“ Fine . Just tired is all . Could n’t sleep last night . ”
12628	12637	12619	12619	Chuckling	94	“ That explains those bags under your eyes . ”
12646	12664	12643	12643	Hoyt	267	“ Looks like you been et by a wolf and shit over a cliff , dawlin ’ . ”
12676	12683	12666	12666	I	1777	“ Somebody had to say it ! ”
12692	12724	12684	12684	I	1777	“ Really ? Somebody had to say I look like I was eaten by a wolf and shit over a cliff ? That ’s something someone really needed to tell me ? ”
12732	12748	12749	12749	He	94	“ Aw , now c’m on , Miss Bianca , I ’m only teasin ’ . ”
12757	12765	12749	12749	He	94	“ Y’all actually look like somebody died . ”
12793	12799	12800	12800	I	1777	“ I ’m just tired , ”
12812	12821	12800	12800	I	1777	“ Now could everyone please get to work ? ”
12855	12863	12864	12864	she	954	“ Make you a gris - gris , ”
12870	12880	12864	12864	she	954	“ for protection against whatever ’s ailin ’ you . ”
13053	13062	13037	13037	she	954	“ You mad at that jambalaya , Bianca ? ”
13095	13113	13092	13092	I	1777	“ No , and please do n’t say anything about how bad I look , I already — ”
13200	13211	13196	13196	She	954	“ Hey , what do you think of these earrings ? ”
13241	13268	13237	13237	Hoyt	267	“ Ai n’t nobody lookin ’ at ya earrings , couillon . And pull down that skirt , I kin see clear to the promised land ! ”
13269	13276	13277	13277	I	1777	“ They ’re lovely , Pepper , ”
13324	13344	13321	13321	Pepper	47	“ I bought them with the tip I got last night from Mr. Boudreaux . The heels , too . ”
13386	13392	13393	13393	I	1777	“ How nice for you , ”
13396	13414	13393	13393	I	1777	“ Now tell me why you ’re in the kitchen and not up front at the desk . ”
13415	13434	13456	13456	Pepper	47	“ Oh yeah ! That ’s what I came to tell you . It ’s about Mr. Boudreaux . ”
13450	13455	13435	13435	I	1777	“ What about him ? ”
13459	13472	13456	13456	Pepper	47	“ He ’s here . And he wants to talk to you . ”
13487	13501	13483	13483	him	96	“ Tell him I ’m busy . I ca n’t get away now . ”
13520	13541	13515	13515	Her	47	“ Um . He sort of . . . you know . Demanded to see you . Like he does . ”
13549	13577	13542	13542	I	1777	“ Today you do n’t seem quite as inclined to shove a bucket of crawdads where the sun does n’t shine like you did yesterday , Pepper . ”
13582	13591	13578	13578	She	47	“ He might have given me another tip . ”
13620	13626	13578	13578	She	47	“ What does he want ? ”
13630	13651	13627	13627	Pepper	47	“ All he said was , and I ’m quoting , ‘ Bring the owner to me . Now . ’ ”
13715	13725	13712	13712	I	1777	“ That man could give the baby Jesus hemorrhoids ! ”
13785	13842	13781	13781	I	1777	“ You go tell Mr. Boudreaux that the owner is as busy as a one - legged cat in a sandbox . I wo n’t be coming out to see him , now or ever . If he ’s got something to say to me , he can have his blasted lawyer write me a letter . ”
13849	13865	13843	13843	Pepper	47	“ Um . . . I do n’t think that ’ll go over , Bianca . ”
13866	13881	13882	13882	I	1777	“ Good , let him be the one to lose sleep for a change , ”
13928	13932	13933	13933	Pepper	47	“ All right . ”
13940	13953	13933	13933	Pepper	47	“ But I do n’t think he ’s gon na like it . ”
14022	14029	14010	14010	Pepper	47	“ I tried to tell you ! ”
14130	14133	14134	14134	I	1777	“ You , ”
14144	14162	14134	14134	I	1777	“ are not welcome in my kitchen . Now turn your uppity butt around and get out . ”
14243	14247	14248	14248	he	77	“ Everybody out ! ”
14285	14290	14291	14291	I	1777	“ Everybody stay put ! ”
14294	14303	14291	14291	I	1777	“ The next person who moves is fired ! ”
14380	14384	14385	14385	Jackson	487	“ Miss Hardwick , ”
14400	14415	14385	14385	Jackson	487	“ Where ’s your attorney ? Or are you serving me the papers yourself ? ”
14425	14428	14416	14416	He	77	“ Attorney ? ”
14434	14445	14416	14416	He	77	“ Oh . No , I ’m not suing you . ”
14468	14476	14465	14465	He	77	“ I have a job for you . ”
14602	14605	14564	14564	I	1777	“ No . ”
14688	14697	14685	14685	he	267	“ This is an incredible opportunity for you — ”
14709	14744	14698	14698	My	1777	“ How thoughtful of you to think of little ol’ me for your precious opportunity ! I ’ve been waiting so long for such a tantalizing offer ! Whatever would I do without you ? ”
14769	14796	14766	14766	he	267	“ Everyone . Out . Now . If she fires you , I ’ll pay you each a year ’s salary and find you other jobs . ”
14943	14957	14940	14940	I	1777	“ We open in ten minutes . I have two hundred reservations tonight . ”
14961	14966	14958	14958	He	522	“ You look tired . ”
15019	15047	15058	15058	He	522	“ And you look like you were raised in the woods by a tribe of cannibals . All you ’re missing is a bone in your beard . ”
15086	15102	15083	15083	I	1777	“ Am I going to have to call the police to get you to leave ? ”
15103	15133	15165	15165	He	522	“ The chief of police and I serve together on the board of the Peace Officers Association . I ’m sure Gavin would be happy to take your call . ”
15144	15153	15138	15138	my	1777	“ You enjoy this , do n’t you ? ”
15154	15157	15165	15165	He	522	“ What ? ”
15158	15164	15138	15138	my	1777	“ Throwing your weight around . ”
15218	15234	15214	15214	he	522	“ About as much as you enjoy being told what to do , I think . ”
15235	15242	15214	15214	he	522	“ I do n’t take orders . ”
15243	15284	15285	15285	His	522	“ Neither do I. And for the record , I do n’t enjoy throwing my weight around , but every once in a while it ’s the most convenient way to get what I want . And I want you . ”
15295	15303	15285	15285	His	522	“ To come to work for me . ”
15328	15363	15364	15364	He	522	“ I do n’t want to work for you . I do n’t need to work for you . And even if I did , I could n’t . Look around — I’m busy . ”
15390	15486	15364	15364	He	522	“ It ’s a catering job . A onetime thing . I ’m having a benefit dinner and auction at my home for a charity , and I need someone to create the menu and oversee the food and wine for the event . And cook , of course . You ’d be in charge of the entire thing . You can bring in whatever staff you need to assist you . There will be press . A lot of press . I ’d give you and your restaurant full credit in the event materials . ”
15698	15714	15695	15695	I	1777	“ I ’m flattered you ’d think of me , but the answer is no . ”
15722	15731	15719	15719	he	1793	“ Your fee would be twenty thousand dollars . ”
15751	15760	15741	15741	I	1777	“ Tw . . . twenty . . . ”
15761	15765	15766	15766	he	1793	“ Thousand dollars , ”
15865	15882	15861	15861	Jackson	487	“ I ’m sure you can find a use for that kind of money . Right ? ”
15937	15967	15933	15934	the Beast	522	“ Right . The event ’s in two weeks . I ’m having three hundred guests . I need a full menu with wine pairings by this time tomorrow . ”
15973	15990	15968	15968	My	1777	“ Three hundred people ? Two weeks ? Are you kidding me ? That ’s impossible ! ”
16001	16010	15993	15993	I	1777	“ No , it ’s twenty thousand dollars . ”
16011	16016	15968	15968	My	1777	“ Wait a minute — ”
16017	16025	15993	15993	I	1777	“ I ’ll pay you up front . ”
16085	16107	16082	16082	he	537	“ I ’ll send a car for you at ten o’clock tomorrow morning so you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen . ”
16227	16234	16224	16224	Eeny	954	“ Your chariot awaits , boo . ”
16374	16402	16371	16371	I	1777	“ Please do n’t forget to process the shellfish and get it on ice . And the Nieman Ranch delivery should be here no later than noon . ”
16406	16442	16371	16371	I	1777	“ Expectin ’ Carl to be on time with the meat is like expectin ’ to see a gorilla ridin ’ a tricycle down the sidewalk . That boy is slower than a Sunday afternoon . ”
16487	16495	16497	16497	Eeny	954	“ Well off you go , Cinderella , ”
16505	16517	16497	16497	Eeny	954	“ Do n’t want your chariot to turn into a pumpkin ! ”
16518	16531	16532	16532	I	1777	“ I ’m glad this is so amusing to you , Eeny , ”
16553	16584	16546	16546	she	954	“ It ’s good for you to get out with a man every once in a while . Keeps the juices flowin ’ , if you know what I mean . ”
16591	16600	16585	16585	My	1777	“ This is n’t a date , Eeny . ”
16601	16607	16608	16608	she	954	“ Oh , I know , ”
16612	16648	16649	16649	she	954	“ But judgin ’ by the way Jackson Boudreaux looks at you like you turn his brain to scrambled eggs , it ai n’t all business , either . At least for him . Lawd ! ”
16658	16668	16649	16649	she	954	“ Who ’s that tall drink o ’ water ? ”
16761	16768	16771	16771	him	557	“ Must be Jackson ’s driver . ”
16777	16788	16771	16771	him	557	“ Wonder if he ’s as mean as his boss . ”
16789	16794	16796	16796	Eeny	954	“ Mm - mmm ! ”
16802	16821	16796	16796	Eeny	954	“ He could be meaner’n a drawer of snakes and I ’d still take him for a roll . ”
16862	16867	16859	16859	I	1777	“ Thanks for sharing , ”
16879	16885	16886	16886	he	560	“ Mornin ’ , ladies , ”
16891	16908	16886	16886	he	560	“ Do n’t you two look prettier than a picture standin ’ there by the window ! ”
16928	16932	16933	16933	I	1777	“ Good morning . ”
16941	16951	16933	16933	I	1777	“ I ’m Bianca , and this is Ambrosine . ”
16952	16957	16958	16958	she	390	“ Call me Eeny , ”
16964	16970	16958	16958	she	390	“ How do you do ? ”
16971	16981	16982	16982	he	560	“ It ’s a pleasure to meet you both , ”
16994	17062	16982	16982	he	560	“ I must admit , I ’ve been dyin ’ to come in and get a taste of your cookin ’ since you opened , Miss Bianca , but I just have n’t found the time . I was a real big fan of your mama ’s restaurant . And might I say you bear a striking resemblance to your mama , too . Those beautiful cheekbones . ”
17100	17117	17147	17147	He	561	“ Thank you , that ’s a lovely thing to say . Mr. . . . ? ”
17118	17134	17135	17135	He	561	“ Where are my manners ! I ’m Rayford Hayes , Mr. Boudreaux ’s majordomo . ”
17141	17146	17135	17135	He	561	“ At your service . ”
17200	17205	17197	17197	I	1777	“ Shall we go ? ”
17206	17213	17214	17214	He	561	“ Yes , ma’am . Eeny . ”
17234	17241	17214	17214	He	561	“ Have yourself a wonderful day . ”
17263	17272	17273	17273	she	565	“ You do the same , Mr. Hayes , ”
17283	17288	17273	17273	she	565	“ Toodle - oo ! ”
17315	17323	17312	17312	he	561	“ Everything all right , Miss Bianca ? ”
17324	17344	17295	17295	Rayford	1721	“ Yes , but . . . would it be all right if I rode up front with you ? ”
17349	17353	17345	17345	He	561	“ With me ? ”
17366	17398	17354	17354	I	1777	“ It ’s just that I ’m not accustomed to being chauffeured . It seems a little . . . well , let ’s just say it ’s not my style . ”
17408	17419	17420	17420	He	561	“ Why of course . Whatever makes you most comfortable . ”
17437	17442	17420	17420	He	561	“ Right this way . ”
17487	17495	17496	17496	I	1777	“ This is a very nice car , ”
17528	17536	17525	17525	Rayford	1721	“ You do n’t sound too impressed . ”
17550	17593	17543	17543	I	1777	“ I do n’t even own a car . I live six blocks from the restaurant and walk to work every day . I could n’t tell you what kind of car this is if you held a gun to my head . ”
17602	17621	17594	17594	Rayford	1721	“ I ’ll be sure not to tell that to Mr. Boudreaux . It might break his heart . ”
17630	17638	17639	17639	I	1777	“ Have you worked for him long ? ”
17654	17674	17622	17622	He	1721	“ I ’ve worked for his family for most of my life . Known Jackson since he was born . ”
17687	17690	17679	17679	I	1777	“ Really ? ”
17694	17735	17691	17691	He	1721	“ Went to work for Clemmy and Brig before I even had hair on my chin . Started out in the stables , muckin ’ stalls , worked my way into the laundry , eventually got promoted to the kitchens . ”
17762	17800	17858	17859	Oh boy	575	“ From there I learned everything there was to know about runnin ’ a grand house . Though Jackson ’s estate is much smaller than his parents ’ , it ’s still an awful lot of work . ”
17817	17831	17858	17859	Oh boy	575	“ So how did you come to be with him in New Orleans ? ”
17847	17857	17837	17837	Rayford	1721	“ That ’s not my story to tell , Miss. ”
17881	17912	17858	17859	Oh boy	575	“ Got it . Sorry . My mama ’s always telling me I talk too much . Says my gift of the gab is a shade closer to a curse . ”
17924	17963	17913	17913	He	575	“ How is your mama , anyway ? I did n’t know her well , just an occasional customer like I said , but I was real sorry to hear about what happened to her restaurant during Katrina . ”
17983	18020	17971	17971	I	1777	“ She ’s fine , thank you for asking . I just saw her this morning . We only live a few blocks apart so I like to stop by on my way to the restaurant . ”
18089	18094	18096	18096	Rayford	1721	“ Here we are , ”
18134	18141	18131	18131	Rayford	1721	“ Beautiful , is n’t she ? ”
18196	18239	18191	18191	Rayford	1721	“ Rivendell ’s got ten bedrooms , twelve bathrooms , and over fifteen thousand square feet on a five - acre lot . Jackson bought up the property on both sides and tore down the houses so he could have more privacy . ”
18247	18262	18240	18240	I	1777	“ Rivendell ? The house is named after the elven realm in The Hobbit ? ”
18270	18276	18263	18263	Rayford	1721	“ You a Tolkien fan ? ”
18280	18299	18277	18277	I	1777	“ A book fan in general . I ’m a little obsessed , really . I read everything . ”
18300	18305	18306	18306	Rayford	1721	“ Do you now , ”
18325	18363	18277	18277	I	1777	“ My father used to always read to me before bed when I was little . I guess I fell in love with books way back then , and it ’s been an ongoing affair ever since . ”
18364	18377	18378	18378	Rayford	1721	“ You ’ll be wantin ’ to see the library , then , ”
18381	18395	18378	18378	Rayford	1721	“ I swear we ’ve got more books than the Library of Congress . ”
18555	18569	18570	18570	Rayford	1721	“ You ’re lookin ’ a little spooked over there , Miss Bianca . ”
18575	18579	18570	18570	Rayford	1721	“ You okay ? ”
18580	18587	18588	18588	I	1777	“ Fine as frog ’s hair ! ”
18610	18625	18607	18607	Rayford	1721	“ Good . He ’s lookin ’ forward to seein ’ you , too . ”
18643	18651	18640	18640	Rayford	1721	“ Ah ! Speak of the devil ! ”
18781	18789	18778	18778	He	1721	“ Why are you sitting in front ? ”
18833	18847	18848	18848	I	1777	“ And a fine good morning to you , too , Mr. Boudreaux , ”
18852	18875	18848	18848	I	1777	“ I see you ’re in your usual sunshine - and - rainbows mood . Did you misplace your human pills again ? ”
19006	19013	19001	19001	I	1777	“ Is he always this charming ? ”
19025	19036	19019	19019	He	1721	“ Not everyone has the gift of the gab , Miss. ”
19046	19069	19043	19043	he	1721	“ And if you ’re treated like a stray dog long enough , you start to believe it and act like one . ”
19172	19180	19181	19181	I	1777	“ I should ’ve brought a sweater , ”
19217	19224	19226	19226	Rayford	1721	“ You get used to it , ”
19228	19271	19226	19226	Rayford	1721	“ The heat ’s always on , but marble ’s real stubborn about warmin ’ up , and this time of year we get a cold breeze comin ’ off the water , which does n’t help . The kitchen ’s better . ”
19313	19317	19318	19318	I	1777	“ Holy Christmas ! ”
19329	19339	19326	19326	Rayford	1721	“ Told you we had a lot of books . ”
19460	19465	19455	19455	me	1777	“ Do you read ? ”
19487	19494	19495	19495	I	1777	“ I ’ve been known to , ”
19521	19577	19518	19518	I	1777	“ Just before he died , my father asked me what I thought heaven was like . I told him heaven was a library that had a lot of comfortable chairs , good lighting , and every book ever written . If I lived here , I ’d spend all my time in this room . ”
19619	19627	19628	19628	he	606	“ That explains your interesting cocktail menu , ”
19644	19650	19635	19635	I	1777	“ Interesting ? Not pretentious ? ”
19682	19693	19694	19694	He	606	“ It ’s only pretentious if you ’re faking it . ”
19707	19715	19694	19694	He	606	“ So the classics are your favorite ? ”
19764	19773	19774	19774	I	1777	“ The classics were my father ’s favorites , ”
19778	19789	19774	19774	I	1777	“ I created the cocktail menu in honor of him . ”
19808	19813	19814	19814	he	606	“ I ’m sorry , ”
19818	19824	19814	19814	he	606	“ I did n’t know . ”
19825	19836	19837	19837	Jackson	487	“ That ’s because you did n’t bother to ask . ”
19853	19865	19847	19847	Rayford	1721	“ Ahem . Should we proceed to the kitchen , sir ? ”
19905	19908	19910	19910	Rayford	1721	“ Well , ”
19917	19933	19910	19910	Rayford	1721	“ I think you ’d best go buy yourself a lottery ticket , Miss Bianca . ”
19947	19970	19998	19998	His	1721	“ Mr. Boudreaux has n’t apologized to anyone in as long as I can remember . Today must be your lucky day . ”
19971	19974	19975	19975	I	1777	“ Rayford , ”
19982	19997	19975	19975	I	1777	“ Please do n’t make me curse . My mama does n’t like it . ”
20017	20030	20032	20032	Jackson	487	“ . . . and all the pans are in these drawers , ”
20174	20186	20187	20187	Jackson	487	“ The side patio will be used for a staging area , ”
20210	20249	20187	20187	Jackson	487	“ The south lawn will be tented and set up with the dining tables . The silent auction is scheduled to begin at four with cocktails and passed hors d’oeuvres , and the dinner seating begins at six . ”
20250	20259	20285	20285	He	616	“ Which event coordinator are you working with ? ”
20288	20333	20285	20285	He	616	“ She ’s got all the rentals already covered , including china , glassware , linens , tables , all of it . Everything will be set the day before , so there should be no one in your way when you get started . ”
20349	20362	20285	20285	He	616	“ I ’ll need to talk to her about the buffet setup — ”
20363	20370	20371	20371	he	616	“ It ’s not a buffet , ”
20374	20380	20371	20371	he	616	“ Dinner will be served . ”
20388	20391	20385	20385	I	1777	“ Served ? ”
20401	20421	20395	20395	Jackson	487	“ I ’ve hired waitstaff . And bartenders . All you have to worry about is making the food . ”
20504	20520	20494	20494	My	1777	“ Great . I ’d like to talk to the coordinator today , if possible . ”
20521	20551	20553	20555	the charity gala	618	“ I ’ll have Rayford give you her contact information before you leave . And the coordinator from the Wounded Warrior Project wants to speak with you , too . ”
20603	20612	20600	20600	I	1777	“ Oh , you were in the military ? ”
20651	20656	20637	20637	He	561	“ About the menu . ”
20753	20761	20750	20750	he	561	“ This will do . Wine pairings ? ”
20765	20768	20762	20762	I	1777	“ No . ”
20782	20785	20777	20777	he	561	“ No ? ”
20786	20796	20769	20769	Jackson	487	“ Bourbon pairings . Specifically , Boudreaux Bourbon pairings . ”
20830	20833	20824	20824	he	561	“ Explain . ”
20843	20873	20840	20840	I	1777	“ When I told you I loved your family ’s bourbon , it was the truth . There ’s a good reason it ’s the world ’s bestselling spirit — ”
20874	20883	20884	20884	Jackson	487	“ Yes . Millions of dollars of marketing , ”
20898	20913	20887	20887	I	1777	“ No . It ’s because it ’s the best bourbon money can buy . ”
20923	20944	20919	20919	he	561	“ You already have the job , Miss Hardwick . You do n’t have to blow smoke up my ass . ”
20951	20987	20945	20945	Face	124	“ I never blow smoke into anyone ’s orifices , Mr. Boudreaux . Your bourbon is the best , or I would n’t put it in my food and serve it to my blasted customers ! ”
21094	21102	21108	21108	his	561	“ Look . All this food I ’ve proposed”—I
21109	21133	21108	21108	his	561	hands—“was chosen specifically because it would pair well with and highlight the unique aspects of the various lines of bourbon that you sell . ”
21134	21140	21141	21141	he	561	“ That my family sells , ”
21182	21186	21187	21187	I	1777	“ Excuse me , ”
21191	21316	21187	21187	I	1777	“ That your family sells . My idea was that since you were putting on this event , as opposed to Joe Billionaire whose family makes urinal cakes , it would be nice to showcase the artistry and craftsmanship of your family ’s products . I think it would be a real treat for your guests , make it more personal . I mean , if you ’re going to all this trouble to make this event special , why not dazzle them with all the bells and whistles ? Show them what the Boudreaux family name stands for . Show them what two hundred years of perfecting the craft of distilling tastes like . Give ’em the steak , not just the sizzle ! ”
21347	21350	21351	21351	he	561	“ Christ , ”
21361	21368	21351	21351	he	561	“ would my father love you . ”
21390	21428	21386	21386	I	1777	“ With the passed hors d’oeuvres , we ’ll start with a sparkling prosecco - based cocktail featuring the silver - label bourbon . It ’s called an Old Cuban . . . you ’ll love it . ”
21449	21537	21557	21557	he	561	“ And we ’ll have a classic mojito using Boudreaux Special Select white rum , which will pair wonderfully with the first course . The main course features braised beef , which will be delicious with the black label — all that smoky , muscular character will really bring out the flavors in the meat — and for dessert we can make a Honey - Hattan with the honey bourbon to pair with the ginger - orange cheesecake . My mouth is watering just thinking of it ! ”
21560	21574	21557	21557	he	561	“ You actually do love my family ’s bourbon , do n’t you ? ”
21589	21594	21575	21575	He	561	“ Do n’t you ? ”
21609	21622	21599	21599	his	561	“ Sure , the same way I love getting a root canal . ”
21649	21748	21749	21749	His	561	“ Mr. Boudreaux , I know what I ’m doing . It ’s really difficult to pair cocktails with food , especially through an entire meal , which is another thing that ’s going to make it so special . I ’ll bet good money that none of your guests has ever had a curated bourbon pairing with a four - course dinner . Trust me . It ’s going to be fantastic . And the better they think it is , the bigger they ’ll open their wallets . Which is really the whole point , right ? ”
21781	21786	21787	21787	he	561	“ Call me Jackson , ”
21800	21816	21797	21797	I	1777	“ If I wanted to call you Jackson , I would have , Mr. Boudreaux . ”
21823	21830	21831	21831	he	561	“ I suppose I deserve that , ”
21835	21862	21831	21831	he	561	“ In my defense , I ’d had a terrible day when we first met . I might have been a little more blunt than usual . ”
21866	21913	21863	21863	I	1777	“ Blunt ? Try tactless ! Try rude ! And by the way , other people have bad days all the time and do n’t turn into high - and - mighty mood monsters and start insulting everyone in sight . It ’s called common courtesy . ”
21933	21951	21929	21929	He	561	“ If you were mine , I ’d take you over my knee for that little speech . ”
21981	21984	21998	21998	Jackson	487	“ Jingle Bells ”
21999	22002	22003	22003	Boudreaux	487	“ the Beast ”
22014	22017	22018	22018	He	561	“ Cody ! ”
22073	22089	22070	22070	his	631	“ I ’m so sorry , Mr. Boudreaux , he just got away from me ! ”
22140	22157	22158	22158	Jackson	487	“ It ’s all right , Charlie . Have a seat . I ’ll take him . ”
22230	22244	22216	22216	Charlie	1721	“ Oh , no , sir , I can see you ’re busy . ”
22248	22253	22245	22245	Jackson	487	“ I said sit . ”
22268	22272	22273	22273	she	487	“ Good morning , ”
22286	22292	22273	22273	she	487	“ I ’m Charlotte Harris . ”
22299	22311	22293	22293	I	1777	“ Bianca Hardwick . It ’s a pleasure to meet you . ”
22317	22359	22312	22312	Charlie	1721	“ You ’re the new chef ! Oh , thank heavens . I ’m afraid my repertoire goes about as far as scrambled eggs and toast . Poor Mr. Boudreaux has been surviving on scraps since Gregory quit , and I — ”
22360	22371	22373	22373	Jackson	487	“ She ’s only helping with the benefit , Charlie , ”
22482	22500	22479	22479	I	1777	“ Well , since I ’m here , would you like me to make something for lunch ? ”
22516	22530	22531	22531	she	637	“ Oh , no , I could n’t ask you to do that , ”
22549	22571	22542	22542	I	1777	“ Sure you could . Sit a spell and let me see what ’s in that airplane hangar of a refrigerator . ”
22614	22628	22602	22602	I	1777	“ I mean . . . unless you ’d rather I did n’t . ”
22660	22663	22664	22664	he	43	“ Lady ! ”
22667	22672	22664	22664	he	43	“ Hi , lady ! ”
22703	22712	22713	22713	I	1777	“ Hi , Cody . I ’m Bianca . ”
22729	22733	22726	22726	Cody	43	“ Jingle bells ! ”
22741	22757	22737	22737	Jackson	487	“ Yes , Miss Hardwick . I think we would all like that very much . ”
22813	22820	22804	22804	I	1777	“ Please , call me Bianca . ”
23217	23223	23215	23215	Jackson	487	“ — like some pepper ? ”
23258	23266	23215	23215	Jackson	487	“ What ? What did you say ? ”
23287	23302	23267	23267	Bianca	58	“ I said would you like some fresh - ground pepper with your pasta ? ”
23364	23367	23391	23391	She	58	“ No ! ”
23378	23390	23375	23375	She	58	“ Allrighty then . No need to alert the entire state . ”
23408	23424	23391	23391	She	58	“ I ’d love some pepper , thank you ! This smells amazing , Bianca . ”
23425	23435	23437	23437	Bianca	58	“ There was n’t much left in the fridge , ”
23441	23458	23437	23437	Bianca	58	“ but pasta and a few sautéed veggies always makes for a quick and tasty meal . ”
23459	23470	23472	23472	Charlie	1721	“ Sweet of you to make Cody mac and cheese , ”
23511	23539	23480	23480	He	43	“ In my experience , kids will always go for a bowl of mac and cheese , no matter how much of a picky eater they are . ”
23540	23547	23549	23549	Charlie	1721	“ Do you have little ones ? ”
23609	23621	23606	23606	Bianca	58	“ I do n’t , much to my mama ’s disappointment . ”
23738	23749	23735	23735	Bianca	58	“ Someday , though , hopefully . I love kids . ”
23928	23951	23952	23952	she	58	“ And now I really need to get back to the restaurant . I ’ll give both coordinators a call this afternoon , ”
23959	23971	23952	23952	she	58	“ and let you know if I have any other questions . ”
23972	23975	23976	23976	I	1777	“ Fine , ”
24020	24035	24017	24017	I	1777	“ Rayford will give you the check for your fee on your way out . ”
24081	24091	24092	24092	she	58	“ It ’s always a pleasure , Mr. Boudreaux , ”
24319	24322	24306	24306	I	1777	“ Whoa ! ”
24336	24360	24306	24306	I	1777	“ Easy , girl . I know I ’m handsome as sin , but there ’s no need to throw yourself at me . ”
24383	24389	24390	24390	I	1777	“ Do n’t flatter yourself . ”
24397	24408	24390	24390	I	1777	“ I just was n’t watching where I was going . ”
24540	24552	24537	24537	He	79	“ Where you going in such a hurry , bumble bee ? ”
24569	24574	24575	24575	I	1777	“ Away from you , ”
24600	24603	24604	24604	he	79	“ Wait , ”
24610	24618	24604	24604	he	79	“ I want to talk to you . ”
24619	24622	24623	24623	I	1777	“ No . ”
24638	24643	24644	24644	he	79	“ Bianca , please , ”
24657	24666	24644	24644	he	79	“ I really want to talk to you . ”
24704	24788	24701	24701	I	1777	“ I know you ’re not really clear on this , Trace , so let me break it down for you . When a woman says no , she does n’t mean yes . She does n’t mean maybe . She does n’t mean please try to talk me out of it because I really do n’t mean it , but I just want you to work a little harder . She means no . N. O. Now get out of my way . ”
24789	24800	24701	24701	I	1777	“ But you never gave me a chance to explain — ”
24801	24804	24701	24701	I	1777	“ Explain ! ”
24813	24885	24701	24701	I	1777	“ Explain what ? That you tripped and fell and your penis accidentally landed inside my best friend ? And the checkout girl at Halley ’s Market ? And the waitress at Dooley ’s ? And whoever the bimbo was who kept texting you for a booty call at two a.m. ? That ’s a lot of tripping , Romeo . You need to see a doctor for your balance problem . ”
24898	24913	24888	24888	he	79	“ I know I was an idiot , but I swear I ’ve changed . ”
24918	24929	24914	24914	My	1777	“ Really ? Got a brain transplant , did you ? ”
24936	24943	24933	24933	Trace	79	“ No . I found God . ”
24959	24989	24951	24951	I	1777	“ Well good for you ! Hallelujah ! Now get your slutty butt out of my face before I lose my temper and send you off to meet Him ! ”
25027	25029	25020	25020	he	79	“ fixed ”
25050	25078	25039	25040	this Trace	79	“ It ’s been two years , Bianca . I swear , I ’m a different man . Please , I just want to talk to you . ”
25087	25120	25079	25079	I	1777	“ I get it . This is like a thirteen - step program , right ? You have to apologize to me or else you wo n’t get past the pearly gates ? ”
25124	25158	25121	25121	He	79	“ I think you mean twelve step . And no , that ’s not it . I just . . . You cut me off and never took any of my calls again — ”
25159	25169	25170	25170	I	1777	“ I ’d rather talk to a bill collector , ”
25174	25186	25170	25170	I	1777	“ At least I know it ’d be an honest conversation . ”
25243	25329	25239	25239	He	267	“ I ’m sorry . That ’s all I wanted to say . I treated you badly , and you did n’t deserve it . I did n’t want to stalk you after we broke up , but I kept hoping I ’d run into you somewhere . And here you are . So . . . I ’m sorry . I really did love you , even though I did what I did . It just took losing you to make me realize it . ”
25353	25370	25350	25350	he	267	“ Actually , I still love you , bumble bee . I think I always will . ”
25457	25482	25443	25443	I	1777	“ I ca n’t say it was nice to see you , Trace , but it was definitely interesting . Good luck to you . ”
25548	25556	25557	25557	Eeny	954	“ Um , whatchya doin’ , boo ? ”
25566	25574	25575	25575	I	1777	“ Making sure I was n’t followed , ”
25590	25593	25594	25594	She	954	“ Followed ? ”
25597	25610	25594	25594	She	954	“ Your meetin ’ with the werewolf went that bad , huh ? ”
25641	25691	25623	25623	I	1777	“ Ugh . That was a whole other disaster . Remind me to have a shot of liquor before I talk to Jackson Boudreaux again . Maybe he ’ll make sense if I ’m tipsy . But I was n’t talking about him . I was talking about Trace . ”
25730	25745	25721	25721	she	954	“ Trace ! Lawd ! What on earth you doin’ talkin ’ to him ? ”
25746	25756	25757	25757	I	1777	“ Believe me , it was n’t my idea . ”
25779	25816	25721	25721	she	954	“ Well what did he say ? More importantly , how did he look ? Does he still have all those big ol’ muscles in all the right places , or did he let himself go ? ”
25820	25836	25817	25817	I	1777	“ The day Trace Adams lets himself go is the day the earth stops spinning . ”
25837	25849	25817	25817	I	1777	“ So he looked good ? What was he wearin ’ ? ”
25859	25882	25850	25850	I	1777	“ Eeny . Focus . The man is a liar and a cheater . It does n’t matter how good he looks . ”
25888	25917	25883	25883	She	954	“ Can you just tell me if he was wearin ’ those tight jeans like he always used to that accentuated his nice big package and tight butt ? ”
25929	25940	25918	25918	I	1777	“ No . He was wearing a pair of sweatpants . ”
26110	26113	26115	26115	Eeny	954	“ Sweatpants ! ”
26127	26146	26117	26117	She	954	“ Lawd , what a waste . That ’s like hangin ’ curtains on the statue of David . ”
26362	26377	26378	26378	Mama	1754	“ Buck up , child , you look like you ’re at a funeral ! ”
26393	26398	26399	26399	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry . ”
26409	26437	26399	26399	I	1777	“ You ’re right . What can I do for you ? Can I get you anything ? Water ? A snack ? Something else to read ? ”
26466	26483	26463	26463	Mama	1754	“ Hoo ! There ’s my snack right there . You think he likes older women ? ”
26489	26500	26484	26484	I	1777	“ I think those chemicals are going to your head . ”
26507	26520	26501	26501	She	1754	“ Are you saying you do n’t think I could hit that ? ”
26524	26534	26521	26521	I	1777	“ Hit that ? Are you a rapper now ? ”
26540	26570	26571	26571	She	1754	“ If I were , I ’d want to be Jay Z. Married to Beyoncé , can you imagine ? That boy has no idea how lucky he is ! ”
26582	26606	26571	26571	She	1754	“ And if he does n’t watch out , Kanye West is gon na get all up in there and steal his woman . ”
26612	26630	26607	26607	I	1777	“ I ’d ask if you ’ve been drinking , but I ’m afraid of the answer . ”
26631	26636	26637	26637	she	1754	“ Speaking of drinking , ”
26657	26669	26637	26637	she	1754	“ I got a real interesting phone call the other day . ”
26670	26673	26674	26674	I	1777	“ Oh ? ”
26720	26725	26727	26727	Mama	1754	“ Mmm - hmm , ”
26729	26733	26727	26727	Mama	1754	“ From Trace . ”
26748	26755	26734	26734	My	1777	“ Trace ! You ’re joking ! ”
26756	26767	26768	26768	She	1754	“ I ’m serious as a car crash , chère . ”
26783	26793	26768	26768	She	1754	“ Why did n’t you mention you saw him ? ”
26794	26804	26805	26805	I	1777	“ Because I was trying to forget , obviously , ”
26808	26821	26805	26805	I	1777	“ And what business did he have calling you ? The nerve ! ”
26822	26840	26841	26841	She	1754	“ Oh , do n’t you worry , I gave him a good piece of my mind . ”
26849	26866	26841	26841	She	1754	“ Funny , he agreed with everything I said about him . And then he apologized . ”
26872	26901	26867	26867	I	1777	“ Oh , Mama , you know better than to listen to that snake oil salesman . You should ’ve hung up the second you recognized his voice . ”
26902	26906	26907	26907	she	1754	“ I did , ”
26912	26933	26907	26907	she	1754	“ Until he called me back and told me that losing you was the biggest mistake he ’d ever made . ”
26934	26937	26938	26938	I	1777	“ Gag , ”
26941	26953	26938	26938	I	1777	“ And that he ’d do anything to get you back . ”
26954	26963	26907	26907	she	1754	“ Oh , for the love of God . ”
26964	26971	26938	26938	I	1777	“ Which was his other point . ”
26977	26997	26972	26972	I	1777	“ Please do n’t tell me you believe his whole ‘ I ’ve been saved by Jesus ’ spiel ! ”
27018	27040	27013	27013	she	1754	“ For some people , hitting rock bottom is the only way they can start a new journey toward the top . ”
27041	27071	26998	26998	She	1754	“ Rock bottom ! He ’s a ho , Mama , not an alcoholic ! Land ’s sake , he slept with my best friend ! In my bed ! ”
27100	27132	27133	27133	Her	1754	“ I know he did , baby , and that was an awful thing to do . All I ’m saying is . . . occasionally good people make stupid mistakes . ”
27138	27174	27133	27133	Her	1754	“ And honestly , lately I ’ve been thinking a lot about all the mistakes I ’ve made in my life . Sometimes it takes something really bad to put all the good in perspective . ”
27175	27179	27180	27180	I	1777	“ Sweet Jesus , ”
27187	27196	27180	27180	I	1777	“ He ’s put a spell on you . ”
27206	27226	27197	27197	She	1754	“ Nobody ’s put a spell on me . I ’m too thick - headed for it to work . ”
27241	27294	27197	27197	She	1754	“ But after sixty - four years on this earth , I know when a man ’s lying , and I know when a man ’s telling the truth . And when Trace said he still loved you and would do anything to get you back , he was telling the truth . ”
27302	27351	27295	27295	I	1777	“ I ca n’t believe we ’re having this conversation . You saw how devastated I was after we broke up . You remember how much weight I lost and how I cried every day and how I could n’t get out of bed for weeks , right ? ”
27352	27356	27357	27357	she	692	“ I remember , ”
27361	27393	27357	27357	she	692	“ But I also know you have n’t even looked at another man since him . Which makes me think all those feelings you had for him might still be there . ”
27400	27415	27398	27398	me	1777	“ Oh , no . Please tell me you did n’t tell him that . ”
27437	27444	27425	27425	I	1777	“ Mama ! You did n’t ! ”
27456	27485	27445	27445	She	692	“ Do n’t you raise your voice to me , young lady . I am not gon na leave this earth without seeing you settled , you hear ? ”
27486	27493	27494	27494	I	1777	“ You ’re not going anywhere ! ”
27509	27602	27504	27504	She	692	“ And I ’m gon na tell you something else — your own daddy was n’t the saint you think he was . Before we were married that man chased every skirt he saw , and when I found out , I left him flat as a penny run over by a freight train . But he begged me to forgive him , and I ’m glad I did because we were happily married for more than thirty years and he gave me the best gift I ’ve ever gotten — you . ”
27616	27757	27613	27613	She	693	“ Men are n’t like us , baby . They ’re dumb as doughnut holes when it comes to love . But once they decide to commit — not say they ’re committing , but deep in their heart actually make the commitment — they never waver . Your father did n’t waver for thirty years , even when his own parents cut him off without a cent because he married me . He did n’t waver when we found out I could n’t have any more babies , even though he wanted a big family . He did n’t waver through good times or bad , sickness or health , for all the years after he took a vow to love and cherish me . In the end the only thing powerful enough to put us apart was death . ”
27763	27893	27758	27758	Her	694	“ And sometimes I ’m not sure that did it , either . I can still feel him when I ’m low . Every once in a while I smell his cologne , even when I ’m in a room all by myself . Just this morning I rolled over in bed and felt a hand on my forehead , but when I opened my eyes there was no one there . I do n’t know what that means , but I do know this . If your father , God rest his soul , could turn out to be the honest man and true friend and loyal husband he was for all those years , chère , there ’s hope for anyone . Even a scallywag like Trace . ”
27912	27922	27909	27909	I	1777	“ You never told me any of that before . ”
27938	27946	27923	27923	She	695	“ I ’ve never been dying before . ”
27947	27953	27954	27954	I	1777	“ You ’re not dying , ”
27961	27977	27978	27978	She	695	“ We ’re all dying , baby . It ’s just a matter of when . ”
27989	28019	27978	27978	She	695	“ I ’ve had a wonderful life . Maybe better than I deserve . I ’m not afraid to go , so do n’t you be afraid , either . ”
28026	28041	28020	28020	I	1777	“ How can you not be afraid ? I ’m so afraid for you . ”
28050	28065	28066	28066	she	695	“ Because your daddy ’s waiting for me on the other side , baby , ”
28070	28088	28066	28066	she	695	“ Finally we ’ll be together again . Being afraid of that would just be plain stupid . ”
28103	28112	28113	28113	she	695	“ Oh , come on now , chère , ”
28147	28182	28130	28130	She	695	“ You always were such a sentimental little thing . Crying over dead goldfish and those Morris the Cat commercials where he ’s lost and his owner ’s looking for him in the rain . ”
28189	28196	28183	28183	My	1777	“ You ’re not a goldfish ! ”
28202	28289	28197	28197	Her	695	“ Might as well be . We ’re all just here for a blip in time , riding on a rock that ’s flying through space at a million miles a day in a galaxy that has a hundred billion stars . Me , Jay Z , the president , a goldfish . . . in the end there ’s not much difference , chère . We come and go . We live and die . If we ’re lucky , we love and are loved . ”
28306	28327	28290	28290	She	695	“ And I ’ve been incredibly lucky , so do n’t you waste your tears on me , you hear ? ”
28339	28344	28328	28328	I	1777	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
28345	28349	28350	28350	She	695	“ Good girl . ”
28361	28384	28356	28356	Her	695	“ Now where the heck is that male nurse ? I feel in need of some mouth - to - mouth resuscitation ! ”
28749	28753	28755	28756	Doc Halloran	80	“ Perfectly normal , ”
28766	28785	28759	28759	I	1777	“ It ’s a sign the medicine is working , Bianca . Just let it take its course . ”
29126	29138	29140	29140	Claudia	146	“ So we ’re all set with the canapés and cocktails , ”
29161	29194	29140	29140	Claudia	146	“ The musicians are warming up on the lawn . In thirty minutes I ’ll light all the candles , and fifteen minutes after that the guests are scheduled to start arriving . ”
29207	29218	29195	29195	She	146	“ Do you need anything from me at this point ? ”
29224	29235	29219	29219	I	1777	“ No , thanks . I ’m all set here . ”
29236	29239	29240	29240	Claudia	146	“ Good . ”
29246	29273	29240	29240	Claudia	146	“ I ’ll check in with you again in fifty minutes . If you need me , I ’m on my headset . The number ’s — ”
29274	29279	29280	29280	I	1777	“ On the schedule , ”
29283	29287	29280	29280	I	1777	“ I know . ”
29392	29400	29383	29383	her	146	“ Ladies . How ’re we doing ? ”
29440	29446	29447	29447	I	1777	“ Everything ’s under control , ”
29450	29458	29447	29447	I	1777	“ Claudia ’s doing a great job . ”
29532	29542	29528	29528	I	1777	“ Is that what you ’re going to wear ? ”
29581	29587	29588	29588	she	146	“ Fifty minutes , Bianca ! ”
29614	29624	29611	29611	He	267	“ What ’s wrong with what I ’m wearing ? ”
29628	29645	29625	29625	I	1777	“ Nothing , if you want people to think you ’ve been living under a bridge . ”
29671	29685	29668	29668	He	267	“ You must be mistaking me for someone who cares what people think . ”
29743	29785	29740	29740	I	1777	“ Lord knows I ’m no style maven , and I dress for comfort more than anything else , but your guests deserve the best version of you , Mr. Boudreaux . I ’m sorry to say this is n’t it . ”
29848	29853	29855	29855	Jackson	487	“ Oh , really ? ”
29861	29866	29867	29867	We	722	“ Yes , really . ”
29896	29907	29893	29893	He	267	“ So what would you recommend I wear , then ? ”
29908	29915	29893	29893	He	267	“ Do you own a suit ? ”
29922	29927	29916	29916	His	267	“ I hate suits . ”
29928	29935	29893	29893	He	267	“ But do you have one ? ”
29968	29980	29965	29965	I	1777	“ That ’s what you should wear . With a tie . ”
29987	29992	29981	29981	I	1777	“ And dress shoes . ”
30025	30035	30022	30022	I	1777	“ Also , a shave would n’t kill you . ”
30046	30053	30036	30036	His	267	“ You do n’t like beards . ”
30065	30085	30091	30091	he	267	“ Beards are fine . But that thing carpeting your jaw ? Honestly , I ’ve seen tidier jungles . ”
30125	30135	30122	30122	He	267	“ You ’re in fine form today , Bianca . ”
30159	30164	30165	30165	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry , ”
30180	30191	30192	30192	I	1777	“ You ’re right . It ’s just . . . ”
30197	30207	30192	30192	I	1777	“ It ’s just been a rough few weeks . ”
30220	30225	30226	30226	he	267	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
30296	30307	30293	30293	I	1777	“ Just some personal stuff . My mother . . . ”
30411	30415	30416	30416	he	267	“ Your mother ? ”
30432	30465	30416	30416	he	267	“ It ’s nothing . I ’m so sorry , I ’m being unprofessional . If you do n’t mind , Mr. Boudreaux , I ’ll just get back to work now — ”
30466	30469	30470	30470	he	267	“ Jackson , ”
30488	30499	30473	30473	He	267	“ I want you to call me Jackson , Bianca . ”
30527	30534	30523	30523	I	1777	“ Um . . . okay . ”
30687	30690	30675	30675	I	1777	“ Bianca ! ”
30741	30748	30738	30738	I	1777	“ What ? What ’s happening ? ”
30758	30776	30749	30749	She	146	“ Mr. Boudreaux asked for you . He ’s in the tent . You ’d better hurry . ”
30860	30884	30857	30857	I	1777	“ In the tent ? Why would he want me in the tent ? Is n’t the auction supposed to be starting now ? ”
30910	30927	30928	30928	She	146	“ Six minutes ago ! Which is why you need to hurry ! Go ! Now ! ”
30945	30955	30941	30941	I	1777	“ Well hold your horses , I ’m going ! ”
30956	30959	30960	30960	she	146	“ Quickly ! ”
31134	31140	31131	31131	I	1777	“ What ’s going on ? ”
31141	31148	31149	31149	She	146	“ Get up to the stage . ”
31201	31205	31206	31206	I	1777	“ The stage ? ”
31209	31212	31206	31206	I	1777	“ Why ? ”
31222	31243	31213	31214	The server	737	“ Like anybody tells me anything ! All I know is you ’re supposed to get up there right now . ”
31247	31252	31244	31244	I	1777	“ But the schedule — ”
31335	31343	31344	31344	he	741	“ Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ”
31347	31353	31344	31344	he	741	“ I ’m Jackson Boudreaux . ”
31411	31419	31420	31420	Jackson	487	“ Thank you so much for coming , ”
31426	31437	31420	31420	Jackson	487	“ I ’m honored to welcome you to my home . ”
31602	31635	31596	31596	New	151	“ As you may know , I first became involved with the Wounded Warrior Project after my best friend , Christian LeFevre , was wounded while serving in the Marines in Afghanistan . ”
31663	31722	31723	31723	Jackson	152	“ A roadside bomb took Christian ’s legs but not his love of his country , his joy for life , or his dedication to serving others . Though complications from his amputations ultimately claimed his life , the Wounded Warrior Project was there for him in his final months the way no other organization could have been . ”
31843	31956	31840	31840	Jackson	152	“ In the four years since Christian ’s death , I ’ve witnessed firsthand how many lives this organization has touched . How many lives it has changed for the better . How many lives it has saved . This nation and all its citizens owe a great debt to the brave men and women who serve in our military . But the greatest debt of all is to those who are wounded or have fallen in combat . Those who so valiantly and selflessly volunteer to defend us and our allies around the world , and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom , must never be forgotten . ”
31970	31990	31957	31957	Jackson	152	“ It ’s through the efforts of organizations like the Wounded Warrior Project that we ensure they never are . ”
32036	32065	32033	32033	Jackson	152	“ Coming up next we ’re going to start the auction . I ’m sure you ’ll all be very generous to help our wounded vets , right ? ”
32107	32143	32104	32104	He	152	“ But before we get to that , I want to introduce you to the woman who made you all the delicious food you ’ve been eating this evening . Chef , join me onstage . ”
32635	32647	32648	32648	he	152	“ Pretend like you do n’t hate me , and smile , ”
32664	32667	32648	32648	he	152	“ Please . ”
32716	32752	32709	32709	Jackson	487	“ I discovered the magic of Bianca Hardwick ’s cuisine when I visited her restaurant in the French Quarter . The food was so good I stayed all night and tried everything on the menu — ”
32753	32764	32766	32769	someone from the audience	768	“ Maybe it was n’t the food you stayed for ! ”
32818	32832	32815	32815	He	1777	“ Well . Maybe for the first hour it was for the food . ”
32938	32962	32935	32935	Jackson	487	“ I want y’ all to visit Bianca ’s in the Quarter before month ’s end . Will you do that for me ? ”
33034	33046	33027	33027	he	1753	“ You can stop smiling now , for Christ ’s sake ! ”
33047	33052	33053	33053	I	1777	“ Oh thank heavens , ”
33057	33079	33053	33053	I	1777	“ For a minute there I thought I was living in an alternate universe where you actually had a good side . ”
33129	33173	33174	33174	He	1753	“ You ’re right . I do n’t have a good side . The person I was in there is a fabrication , the Jackson Boudreaux who likes people and enjoys the spotlight and feels right at home in a fucking penguin suit . ”
33186	33214	33174	33174	He	1753	“ But that guy knows how to work a crowd and raise money by the fuckload for a charity that helps a lot of soldiers in need . ”
33221	33277	33215	33215	He	1753	“ And that guy is willing to do whatever ’s necessary to keep his end of a bargain with you and promote your restaurant and act like we ’re on good terms , even when it ’s painfully fucking obvious you ’d rather be pushed off a building than have my arm around your shoulders ! ”
33352	33380	33349	33349	I	1777	“ Just to be clear , I would rather have your arm around me than be pushed off a building . That is definitely preferable to death . ”
33420	33474	33417	33417	I	1777	“ Also to be clear , I do n’t hate you . You said that earlier , but it ’s not true . What I feel when I ’m around you is usually irritation , I admit that , but only because you ’re always acting like you just escaped from a zoo . ”
33513	33531	33574	33574	My	1777	“ And even if that was an act in there , I admire that you would do all this”—I
33554	33573	33574	33574	My	1777	equipment—“in memory of your friend who passed away . And to raise money to help others like him . ”
33635	33661	33632	33632	I	1777	“ And to shave and wear a penguin suit and say such nice things about my restaurant , even if you did n’t mean it . ”
33666	33681	33662	33662	He	1753	“ If I did n’t mean it , you would n’t be standing here . ”
33738	33811	33735	33735	I	1777	“ I ’m not comfortable in front of large crowds . That ’s why I was stiff . I was surprised that you put your arm around me and that you were acting so differently , so that contributed to my general weirdness , too , but to be honest I was also very moved by what you said about your friend and had n’t quite recovered when you called me up . ”
33821	33832	33818	33818	I	1777	“ That part was n’t an act , was it ? ”
33841	33868	33836	33836	He	784	“ I loved Christian like a brother . We went to college together . That ’s why I adopted Cody . He ’s Christian ’s son . ”
34090	34117	34087	34087	I	1777	“ Well if you ’ll excuse me , I have to get back to work before Claudia discovers I ’m still gone and has a stroke . ”
34365	34384	34362	34362	He	1721	“ Since you like Boudreaux Bourbon so much , I thought you might want to try something special . ”
34413	34418	34385	34385	He	1721	“ Heritage 30 Year . ”
34423	34433	34419	34419	My	1777	“ I thought that stuff was an urban legend ! ”
34519	34609	34516	34516	He	1721	“ It ’s an orphan from one of only a few dozen barrels made with this particular mash bill . An experiment that was ended when my father opened the barrels after ten years and declared it shit . The rest of the barrels were sold to a competitor for blending , but one was misplaced , found in the back of the rickhouse a few years ago . Turns out the mash bill was perfect , but it needed a lot longer to age than the other recipes . ”
34724	34731	34703	34703	He	267	“ Tell me what you smell . ”
34799	34804	34796	34796	I	1777	“ I smell heaven . ”
34817	34831	34809	34809	I	1777	“ I thought heaven was a library filled with every book ever written . ”
34845	34865	34839	34839	I	1777	“ You have to have something good to drink while you ’re reading a good book , Mr. Boudreaux . ”
34915	34918	34905	34905	He	267	“ Jackson . ”
34942	34949	34937	34937	I	1777	“ Right . Jackson . Sorry . ”
34950	34960	34961	34961	he	267	“ Have I said something to offend you again ? ”
34967	34972	34964	34964	I	1777	“ No . Why ? ”
34980	34991	34973	34973	His	267	“ Because your face gets flushed when you ’re mad . ”
34992	34996	34997	34997	I	1777	“ Or embarrassed , ”
35000	35031	34997	34997	I	1777	“ I get it from my father ’s side . You could always tell when he was feeling something strong because his cheeks would go red as Rudolph ’s nose . ”
35066	35084	35063	35063	he	267	“ Why would you be embarrassed that I told you to call me by my first name ? ”
35176	35179	35162	35162	I	1777	“ Whew ! ”
35187	35195	35162	35162	I	1777	“ That possum ’s on the stump ! ”
35202	35214	35215	35215	I	1777	“ It means it does n’t get any better than that , ”
35229	35248	35226	35226	Jackson	487	“ I know what it means . I ’m just wondering what ’s got you so riled up . ”
35265	35284	35262	35262	I	1777	“ I — I’m uh . . . tired . I get kinda loopy when I ’m tired . ”
35470	35473	35474	35474	I	1777	“ Smooth , ”
35495	35502	35492	35492	He	158	“ Do I make you uncomfortable ? ”
35548	35563	35541	35541	I	1777	“ Have you seen Rayford anywhere ? He said he ’d drive me home . ”
35564	35600	35603	35603	he	813	“ No . And that was the worst segue I ’ve ever heard . So I have to assume the answer to the question you avoided is yes . My next question is , why ? ”
35610	35624	35603	35603	he	813	“ You ’ve made me uncomfortable since the first moment I met you , ”
35643	35660	35640	35640	I	1777	“ But tonight ’s the first time that it ’s not a bad kind of uncomfortable . ”
35684	35694	35681	35681	he	813	“ What kind of uncomfortable is it , Bianca ? ”
35900	35906	35907	35907	Bianca	58	“ I should be going , ”
36016	36020	36021	36021	I	1777	“ Of course , ”
36026	36037	36021	36021	I	1777	“ It ’s late . I wo n’t keep you . ”
36065	36079	36062	36062	Bianca	58	“ Rayford was supposed to drive me home , but I have n’t — ”
36080	36086	36062	36062	Bianca	58	“ I ’ll take you ! ”
36109	36112	36113	36113	she	58	“ Oh , ”
36116	36129	36113	36113	she	58	“ Um . . . I do n’t want to bother you . ”
36130	36137	36138	36138	I	1777	“ It ’s not a bother , ”
36223	36227	36228	36228	I	1777	“ This way , ”
36506	36509	36503	36503	I	1777	“ Seatbelt . ”
36594	36609	36590	36590	Bianca	58	“ That ’s quite a car collection you ’ve got . I counted twelve ? ”
36610	36620	36621	36621	I	1777	“ I have to spend my money on something , ”
36673	36681	36670	36670	Bianca	58	“ Why are you mad right now ? ”
36707	36748	36704	36704	She	58	“ You ’re driving like a crazy person , and I ’m not ready to die yet , so maybe if you told me why you ’re so angry , we could talk about it and you ’d slow down . ”
36752	36758	36749	36749	I	1777	“ I ’m not angry ! ”
36796	36799	36793	36793	she	58	“ Okay . ”
36803	36806	36800	36800	I	1777	“ Fuck . ”
36817	36822	36808	36808	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry . ”
36865	36874	36862	36862	I	1777	“ I ’m not very good with people . ”
36880	36889	36862	36862	I	1777	“ You are when you want to be . ”
36935	36941	36932	36932	I	1777	“ Where am I going ? ”
36942	36949	36976	36976	she	58	“ Tremé . Saint Ann Street . ”
36984	36991	36976	36976	she	58	“ I want to thank you . ”
36992	36996	36976	36976	she	58	“ For what ? ”
36997	37010	36976	36976	she	58	“ For overpaying me . It came at exactly the right time . ”
37023	37077	37017	37017	I	1777	“ You were n’t overpaid . You saved my ass . No one else could ’ve pulled tonight off on such short notice . And the food was incredible . You were right , people opened their wallets . It looks like the auction will be the most successful the Project has had . ”
37093	37101	37078	37078	She	58	“ Well , anyway . Thank you . ”
37134	37146	37131	37131	I	1777	“ What do you mean it came at the right time ? ”
37152	37172	37147	37147	She	58	“ Nothing , just . . . it ’s appreciated . You were very generous . It really helped . ”
37200	37207	37191	37191	She	58	“ Is this about your mother ? ”
37223	37232	37213	37213	She	58	“ How did you know about my mother ? ”
37239	37255	37234	37234	my	1777	“ You mentioned her earlier . You said it had been a rough few weeks . ”
37265	37270	37256	37256	Bianca	58	“ Is she sick ? ”
37283	37324	37271	37271	She	58	“ She would literally kill me if she knew I told you , so I ’m not telling you . But yes . But you did n’t hear that from me , and please do n’t share it with anyone . ”
37356	37368	37352	37352	I	1777	“ You have my word I wo n’t tell a soul . ”
37378	37396	37369	37369	She	58	“ Thank you . It ’s been really hard not having anyone to talk to about it . ”
37466	37477	37463	37463	I	1777	“ My mother ’s been sick for a long time . ”
37484	37500	37478	37478	Bianca	58	“ Really ? Oh , no ! Is it . . . is it bad ? ”
37518	37542	37478	37478	Bianca	58	“ She had a stroke several years ago . She mainly stays in bed now . Has trouble speaking , needs constant care . ”
37560	37565	37567	37567	Bianca	58	“ Oh , Jackson , ”
37569	37586	37567	37567	Bianca	58	“ I ’m so sorry to hear that . How hard it must be for you ! ”
37599	37607	37595	37595	she	58	“ Or are you two not close ? ”
37652	37668	37697	37697	Bianca	58	“ We used to be . But that was before I became such a disappointment . ”
37669	37682	37716	37716	she	58	“ A disappointment ? You ? But you ’re so . . . ”
37719	37762	37716	37716	she	58	“ Well I do n’t know what the right word is , but anyone who adopts a special - needs child and raises money for charity and keeps his end of the deals he makes is n’t a disappointment in my book . ”
37769	37783	37716	37716	she	58	“ Even if you are stuck - up higher than a light pole . ”
37784	37794	37795	37795	I	1777	“ Stuck up ! I am not stuck up ! ”
37824	37843	37816	37816	Bianca	58	“ Oh please , Jackson , you ’re so highfalutin , you think your shit tastes like sherbet . ”
37867	37877	37878	37878	she	58	“ Oh my goodness , I ’m so sorry , ”
37881	37889	37878	37878	she	58	“ That was just classless and rude . ”
37926	37944	37923	37923	She	58	“ Please tell me you ’re not going to put a retroactive stop payment on your check ! ”
37945	37953	37954	37954	I	1777	“ That ’s not even a thing , ”
37971	37991	37961	37961	She	58	“ If my mother knew I ’d said something like that , she ’d knock me into next week . ”
38007	38035	37999	37999	I	1777	“ Do n’t worry about it . You ’ve been giving me grief since the minute we met . I think I ’m starting to like it . ”
38067	38070	38055	38055	I	1777	“ Sorry , ”
38090	38094	38087	38087	she	58	“ Turn here . ”
38139	38151	38152	38152	she	58	“ The white one on the left with the red door , ”
38174	38177	38170	38170	Bianca	58	“ Oh ! ”
38276	38280	38272	38272	I	1777	“ Your boyfriend ? ”
38294	38305	38288	38288	She	58	“ Ex - boyfriend . So very , very ex . ”
38368	38376	38377	38377	I	1777	“ I ’ll get rid of him , ”
38391	38394	38395	38395	She	58	“ No . ”
38418	38425	38410	38410	She	58	“ I have a better idea . ”
38629	38642	38626	38626	He	79	“ Did you just kiss me to try to make him jealous ? ”
38646	38649	38626	38626	He	79	“ Um . ”
38699	38727	38696	38696	he	79	“ You caught me off guard . Let ’s try it again . And this time put your hand on my chest so it looks more authentic . ”
38731	38738	38728	38728	I	1777	“ Lord , you ’re bossy — ”
38885	38902	38882	38882	He	79	“ God , I hope you have a lot of exes you want to make jealous . ”
38939	38946	38936	38936	I	1777	“ Only the one , unfortunately . ”
38960	38963	38947	38947	He	79	“ Unfortunately ? ”
38989	39008	38980	38980	Trace	79	“ Uh , Bianca ? You gon na sit out here all night or are you coming in ? ”
39040	39054	39037	39037	I	1777	“ It ’s none of your business what I do , Trace Adams ! ”
39058	39069	39055	39055	Trace	79	“ I need to talk to you , bumble bee . ”
39074	39085	39070	39070	Jackson	487	“ Do you want to talk to him , Bianca ? ”
39086	39095	39055	39055	Trace	79	“ No ! Not now , not ever ! ”
39099	39111	39096	39096	Trace	79	“ Of course you do . You ’re just being stubborn . ”
39132	39137	39124	39124	I	1777	“ Uh - oh . ”
39150	39180	39145	39145	Jackson	487	“ You have ten seconds to get the fuck away from that window before I make you a fist sandwich and shove it down your throat , my friend . ”
39218	39237	39213	39213	Trace	79	“ I do n’t know who you are , asshole , but nobody talks to me like that . ”
39241	39250	39238	39238	Jackson	487	“ And nobody calls me ‘ asshole . ’ ”
39251	39254	39256	39256	Trace	79	“ Oh , ”
39258	39278	39256	39256	Trace	79	“ ai n’t you an asshole ? Because from where I ’m standing , you sure look like one . ”
39285	39311	39282	39282	Jackson	487	“ And from where I ’m standing , you ’re looking like you ’re one dumb remark away from a visit to the emergency room . ”
39362	39382	39353	39353	I	1777	“ Excuse me , person who claims to have found God , but your ratty old soul is showing ! ”
39387	39391	39383	39383	Trace	79	“ Bumble bee — ”
39392	39424	39383	39383	Trace	79	“ Do n’t you ‘ bumble bee ’ me ! I told you the last time I saw you to leave me alone ! I never want to see you again ! ”
39463	39470	39460	39460	He	79	“ Your mama told me different . ”
39502	39517	39499	39499	I	1777	“ Just because trash can be recycled does n’t mean you deserve another chance . ”
39546	39549	39550	39550	he	79	“ Fine , ”
39553	39584	39550	39550	he	79	“ I can see you ’re not going to be reasonable in front the asshole . So why do n’t you give me a call when he is n’t around . ”
39650	39653	39654	39654	I	1777	“ Ooh , ”
39661	39665	39654	39654	I	1777	“ How manly . ”
39742	39751	39739	39739	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry . That was embarrassing . ”
39778	39809	39762	39762	He	79	“ Do n’t apologize . You have nothing to be sorry for . Do you want me to sit out here awhile , make sure he does n’t come back ? ”
39850	39896	39952	39952	Jackson	487	“ Thank you for offering , but Trace wo n’t come back tonight . He ’ll need to go lick his wounds in some woman ’s bed for a night or two before he works up the nerve to show his face to me again . ”
39905	39951	39897	39897	I	1777	“ Believe me , I ’ve seen it a million times . It ’s just too bad I did n’t bring my pocketbook with me today , because I ’ve got a little present for him in it that will definitely keep him away longer . ”
39963	39967	39952	39952	Jackson	487	“ A present ? ”
39968	39972	39952	39952	Jackson	487	“ Pepper spray . ”
39990	40001	39983	39983	He	1777	“ Remind me never to get on your bad side . ”
40015	40047	40007	40007	I	1777	“ I do n’t know about a bad side , but I do know that a man has to choose me or lose me . I ’m not a backup plan . ”
40081	40094	40078	40078	He	1777	“ He ’s an idiot . But he ’s a lucky idiot . ”
40095	40102	40078	40078	He	1777	“ Why do you say that ? ”
40103	40113	40078	40078	He	1777	“ Because for a while , he had you . ”
40131	40139	40126	40126	I	1777	“ Can I ask a personal question ? ”
40146	40149	40143	40143	he	1777	“ Yes . ”
40156	40178	40150	40150	I	1777	“ Why do you have a semicolon tattooed on your wrist ? I noticed it when we were in the kitchen . ”
40219	40234	40216	40216	He	1777	“ You ’re an avid reader . You know the meaning of a semicolon . ”
40238	40254	40216	40216	He	1777	“ It ’s when the author could have ended a sentence but chose not to . ”
40255	40258	40216	40216	He	1777	“ Exactly . ”
40259	40265	40216	40216	He	1777	“ I do n’t understand . ”
40290	40303	40286	40286	He	1777	“ I ’m the author , and the sentence is my life . ”
40318	40323	40315	40315	I	1777	“ Jackson . . . ”
40344	40360	40324	40324	He	1777	“ It ’s been a long day . I ’ll let you get some rest . ”
40413	40427	40410	40410	I	1777	“ Thank you for the Heritage Thirty Year . That was a treat . ”
40480	40483	40471	40471	he	1777	“ Jackson ? ”
40494	40502	40484	40484	He	1777	“ I ’m sorry about the kiss . ”
40524	40541	40521	40521	He	1777	“ I ’m not . It ’s going to get me through the next four years . ”
40854	40863	40864	40864	she	1754	“ How did the event go , chère ? ”
40904	40921	40882	40882	she	1754	“ It went fine , Mama . Great , in fact . Everyone loved the food . ”
40929	40943	40922	40922	She	1754	“ Of course they did . You ’re the best cook in Louisiana . ”
40944	40949	40882	40882	she	1754	“ Next to you . ”
40955	40975	40950	40950	Her	1754	“ And how did you get along with the infamous Mr. Boudreaux ? Was he as ornery as usual ? ”
41059	41086	41056	41056	I	1777	“ I think sometimes it ’s easier for a man to be the worst version of himself than to let the world keep breaking his heart . ”
41093	41105	41087	41087	Mama	1754	“ You been hittin ’ the sauce this morning , baby ? ”
41113	41148	41106	41106	I	1777	“ I wish . A nice little soul - numbing habit would go a long way on a day like this . But never mind me , what can I get you to eat ? ”
41161	41173	41155	41155	her	1754	“ Lord , please do n’t talk to me about food . ”
41174	41183	41184	41184	I	1777	“ You have to eat something , Mama , ”
41187	41207	41184	41184	I	1777	“ You need your strength . How about some applesauce or white rice ? A bit of boiled chicken ? ”
41214	41240	41208	41208	Mama	1754	“ Nothing . I could n’t keep it down , baby . Just let me sleep for a bit , I ’ll feel better later . ”
41970	41974	41976	41977	my father	372	“ — married , ”
41987	41995	41979	41979	My	1777	“ Sorry ? Who ’s getting married ? ”
41996	42002	41957	41974	An unstable , depressed , hotheaded lunatic who ’d be better off — “ — married , ”	852	“ You are , son . ”
42013	42026	42009	42009	I	1777	“ I think we both know that ’s never going to happen . ”
42045	42061	42042	42042	his	372	“ You have n’t been listening to a word I ’ve said , have you ? ”
42074	42081	42066	42066	I	1777	“ What are you talking about ? ”
42092	42122	42082	42083	My father	372	“ I ’m talking about your obligations to this family . I ’m talking about your mother ’s broken heart . I ’m talking about your trust , Jackson . ”
42123	42127	42128	42128	I	1777	“ My trust ? ”
42242	42299	42238	42239	My father	372	“ Yes . Your trust . Which , as you ’d know if you ’d ever bothered to read the thing , stipulates that you must be involved in the day - to - day operation of Boudreaux Bourbon to continue to receive . In lieu of that , you must marry by thirty - five . ”
42315	42394	42311	42312	My father	372	“ I put that last one in place so you did n’t piss away every dime on strippers and blow , like Harvey Culligan ’s son did . And thirty - five is generous , you have to admit ! I could ’ve made it twenty - five , but I figured a man deserves a few good years to sow his wild oats before he gets hitched . Hoein ’ around builds character . To a point . ”
42423	42479	42420	42420	he	372	“ Your mother and I have been very , very patient with you , son . This conversation never needed to happen at all if you ’d just married Cricket and taken over as Master Distiller like you were supposed to . But after what you did to that poor girl , well . . . ”
42502	42592	42495	42496	My father	372	“ We do n’t need to go over all that mess again . My point here , Jackson , is that you ’re my only son . You ’re the heir to this whole thing the Boudreaux family has built over eight generations . If you continue to shirk your obligations and refuse to at least settle down and give your mother the grandbabies she wants , then I ’m sorry to say , but you ’re gon na be cut off without a red cent to your name . ”
42612	42735	42495	42496	My father	372	“ I ’ve been beatin ’ around the bush about this for years because I felt bad about the state you ’ve been in , but now I ’ll put it to you straight . You have until your birthday to get your ass back to Kentucky and take over as Master Distiller , or get married . To a decent girl , mind you . I ’m not welcomin ’ a hoochie mama into this family ! And before you think about bein ’ tricky and gettin ’ a quickie divorce , you should know that any marriage you enter into needs to last at least five years for you to continue to get your money . The decision ’s yours . ”
42814	42824	42826	42826	Rayford	1721	“ So your daddy finally threw down the gauntlet , ”
42842	42861	42833	42833	he	912	“ Well , you got ta give Brig some credit . At least he gave you a choice . ”
42862	42866	42867	42867	I	1777	“ A choice ? ”
42884	42899	42877	42877	I	1777	“ He did n’t give me a choice , he gave me an ultimatum ! ”
42910	42928	42905	42905	Rayford	1721	“ No such thing as a free lunch , Mr. Boudreaux . You know that better’n anybody . ”
42937	42954	42929	42929	I	1777	“ You know if I ’m poor , you ’re out of a job , right ? ”
42967	43005	42955	42955	Rayford	1721	“ Do n’t be foolish . You ’ve got Cody to think about . His care , his education , everything he needs . Besides , you do n’t know the first thing about bein ’ poor . ”
43065	43086	43050	43050	I	1777	“ Maybe not , but you know as well as I do that I ’m never going back to Kentucky . ”
43096	43108	43087	43087	Rayford	1721	“ So that leaves marriage . Who ’s the lucky girl ? ”
43124	43193	43118	43118	I	1777	“ Gimme a break , Rayford ! Even if I wanted to get married — which I don’t — I could n’t find a wife in thirty days ! I have n’t even been on a date in four years ! There ’s not a sane woman in the entire state who ’d agree to marry a complete stranger and stay married to him for half a decade ! ”
43194	43210	43223	43223	Rayford	1721	“ So find an insane one . Seems to me there ’s lots of ’em . ”
43211	43222	43118	43118	I	1777	“ Jesus Christ . You ’re no help at all . ”
43250	43263	43247	43247	he	1721	“ Funny , I thought I was plenty helpful the other night . ”
43272	43287	43264	43264	I	1777	“ Please do n’t be cryptic . I ca n’t handle cryptic right now . ”
43301	43329	43294	43294	His	1721	“ When I was nowhere to be found at the end of the night of the charity event and you had to drive Miss Bianca Hardwick home . ”
43337	43349	43333	43333	I	1777	“ You ’re kidding me . You did that on purpose ? ”
43356	43406	43351	43351	his	1721	“ Lovely girl , is n’t she ? Lots of moxie , as my mama used to say . And speakin ’ of mamas , did I overhear her tell you her own mama was havin’ some troubles ? Somethin’ about it bein ’ a rough couple of weeks ? ”
43414	43421	43407	43407	My	1777	“ Were you eavesdropping on us ? ”
43425	43450	43422	43422	He	1721	“ Just passin ’ by the kitchen . I ’ve got a pair of workin ’ ears , no need to get all excited . ”
43455	43458	43451	43451	I	1777	“ Rayford . ”
43462	43473	43459	43459	He	1721	“ You know she likes you , do n’t you ? ”
43521	43528	43515	43515	I	1777	“ What makes you say that ? ”
43535	43556	43529	43529	Rayford	1721	“ If I might be so bold , sir , for a smart man you can sometimes be awful stupid . ”
43621	43636	43618	43618	I	1777	“ I told her to smile at me . She was just following orders . ”
43642	43656	43637	43637	Rayford	1721	“ No woman smiles at a man like that because of an order . ”
43805	43810	43812	43812	Rayford	1721	“ Mm - hmm , ”
43818	43824	43812	43812	Rayford	1721	“ So there you go . ”
43825	43831	43850	43850	he	1721	“ There I go what ? ”
43832	43845	43846	43846	he	1721	“ Lord , do I have to do all the heavy lifting ? ”
43858	43867	43850	43850	he	1721	“ Hello , future Mrs. Jackson Walker Boudreaux ? ”
43871	43882	43868	43868	I	1777	“ You ’re . . . that ’s . . . ”
43886	43905	43883	43883	Rayford	1721	“ You already know each other , it ’s clear that she likes you and you like her — ”
43906	43914	43883	43883	Rayford	1721	“ I never said I liked her . ”
43915	43929	43931	43931	Rayford	1721	“ Oh , be quiet , now you ’re just talkin ’ trash , ”
43941	43964	43931	43931	Rayford	1721	“ And there ’s a very good chance that if you sweeten the deal a little bit , she ’d say yes . ”
43976	43981	43965	43965	I	1777	“ Sweeten the deal ? ”
44009	44032	44005	44005	he	1721	“ Everybody ’s got a price . You did n’t know that last time you got engaged , but now you do . ”
44037	44040	44033	44033	I	1777	“ Ouch . ”
44041	44082	44033	44033	I	1777	“ I know . I ’m sorry . But it seems to me that if you go into it with your eyes open , with all your cards on the table , it might work out for both of you . ”
44092	44101	44083	44083	He	1721	“ She does n’t even own a car . ”
44117	44128	44102	44102	I	1777	“ I ca n’t believe we ’re having this conversation . ”
44132	44140	44129	44129	Rayford	1721	“ You told me Cody likes her . ”
44144	44165	44141	44141	I	1777	“ She ’s smart , she ’s got her feet on the ground , and she comes from good stock . ”
44166	44185	44129	44129	Rayford	1721	“ Rayford ! What century is this ? We ’re talking about a woman , not a cow ! ”
44186	44199	44141	44141	I	1777	“ And she is n’t too hard on the eyes , either . ”
44229	44289	44290	44290	Rayford	1721	“ It ’s not gon na happen . What would I do , mosey into her restaurant and say , ‘ Oh , hi there , I was just thinking since you ’re poor and I need a wife that we should get married ’ ? How romantic ! I ’m sure that ’s the proposal of her dreams ! ”
44293	44311	44290	44290	Rayford	1721	“ Maybe if you prefaced it with the mention of a million dollars , it would be . ”
44327	44332	44324	44324	I	1777	“ A million dollars ? ”
44339	44356	44333	44333	He	1721	“ Oh , I ’m sorry , are you not a billionaire ? With a b ? ”
44357	44366	44333	44333	He	1721	“ No ! My father is a billionaire ! ”
44367	44383	44333	44333	He	1721	“ And who ’s his only son who ’s gon na inherit all that money ? ”
44392	44398	44384	44384	I	1777	“ This is completely insane . ”
44411	44429	44408	44408	He	1721	“ And who gets an annual trust stipend in the gazillions every year before his father dies ? ”
44430	44438	44408	44408	He	1721	“ Gazillions are n’t units of currency . ”
44439	44455	44408	44408	He	1721	“ I ’m takin ’ poetic license here , sir , cut me some slack . ”
44482	44617	44479	44479	he	921	“ You do n’t want to go back to Kentucky . You also do n’t want to be dead - ass broke , because you ’ve never had a job in your entire life , and you do n’t know how to do anything except collect overpriced automobiles and mope around in your big ol’ mansion . You would n’t last an hour as a poor man . So your only other option is marriage . Ideally you’da had a girlfriend you could ask , but your antisocial self does n’t have one of those , so we got ta be practical and determine who you could stand livin ’ with for the next few years before you get divorced and go your separate ways , and everybody ’s happy because everybody ’s rich . ”
44623	44642	44618	44618	He	267	“ And from where I ’m sittin ’ , only one woman in the world fits that bill . ”
44754	44786	44787	44787	she	113	“ A woman worth her salt should be the hardest thing a man has to work for in his life , because then she ’s a prize , not a gift , ”
44792	44809	44787	44787	she	113	“ Anything you get for free is worth exactly what you paid for it : nothing . ”
44895	44905	44907	44907	Eeny	954	“ Boo , what ’s happenin ’ with you ? ”
44915	44926	44907	44907	Eeny	954	“ I ’ve never seen you lookin ’ so raggedy ! ”
45013	45020	45021	45021	I	1777	“ I ’m fine , Eeny , ”
45057	45065	45067	45067	Eeny	954	“ Girl , you are not fine ! ”
45076	45136	45067	45067	Eeny	954	“ I ’ve known you since I was cookin ’ in your mama ’s restaurant and you were knee - high to a grasshopper , and never once have I seen you in such a state ! I think you should tell me what ’s goin’ on before I pay a visit to Miss Davina and get the truth ! ”
45211	45217	45218	45218	I	1777	“ Where ’s your apron ? ”
45221	45230	45218	45218	I	1777	“ You ’re blinding me with that getup . ”
45234	45263	45231	45231	She	954	“ I ’m not coverin ’ up this beautiful frock I special ordered with one of those dingy ol’ kitchen aprons ! And do n’t change the subject ! ”
45327	45334	45324	45324	I	1777	“ I ’m fighting a bug . ”
45397	45403	45404	45404	she	954	“ He ’s here again ! ”
45408	45413	45404	45404	she	954	“ It ’s him ! ”
45448	45468	45445	45445	I	1777	“ He ’ll have to wait for a table , unless you can move some of those reservations around . ”
45506	45520	45521	45521	Eeny	954	“ He does n’t want a table ! He wants to see you ! ”
45524	45538	45521	45521	Eeny	954	“ Get the poor man a pair of sunglasses and a stiff drink . ”
45560	45574	45557	45557	I	1777	“ Pepper , please tell him I ’ll be out in a min — ”
45594	45598	45582	45582	He	267	“ Everyone out . ”
45629	45651	45626	45626	I	1777	“ Jackson , we ’re so busy right now . I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t have my employees — ”
45652	45658	45659	45659	he	267	“ We ’re getting married , ”
45754	45760	45761	45761	I	1777	“ How nice for us , ”
45765	45775	45761	45761	I	1777	“ And when will the blessed event take place ? ”
45789	45810	45786	45786	He	267	“ As soon as possible . Tonight , if you want . We can go to the courthouse right now . ”
45904	45945	45954	45954	he	267	“ What the Sam hell is the matter with you ? This is my place of business ! Some of us have to work for a living ! You ca n’t just barge in here and start telling stupid jokes — ”
45946	45953	45954	45954	he	267	“ It ’s not a joke , ”
45961	45976	45954	45954	he	267	“ And if you marry me , you ’ll never have to work again . ”
45984	45997	45977	45977	I	1777	“ You ’ve lost it . You ’ve seriously lost your mind . ”
45998	46004	45954	45954	he	267	“ Just hear me out — ”
46005	46063	45977	45977	I	1777	“ No , I wo n’t hear you out ! I do n’t know who you think you are , but I do n’t find this funny ! And I do n’t have time to listen to whatever stupidity this is ! I swear I oughta just call the loony bin and have them pick you up — ”
46064	46073	45954	45954	he	267	“ I ’ll give you a million dollars . ”
46189	46194	46186	46186	I	1777	“ How dare you . ”
46195	46203	46186	46186	I	1777	“ I know you need the money — ”
46287	46297	46284	46284	he	267	“ What the hell did you do that for ? ”
46305	46338	46302	46302	I	1777	“ I ’m not a whore , Jackson Boudreaux . Whatever your opinion is of me , I ’m setting you straight right here and now . You ca n’t buy me . ”
46339	46357	46299	46300	an idiot	1895	“ I do n’t think you ’re a whore ! Jesus Christ , hold on a minute — ”
46358	46403	46302	46302	I	1777	“ No , you hold on , you rich , dumb , arrogant ass ! I took the catering job because I needed the money , yes , but not for myself , and not so I could get sold into prostitution later on ! ”
46404	46410	46299	46300	an idiot	1895	“ What the fucking hell — ”
46411	46442	46302	46302	I	1777	“ You should be ashamed of yourself ! What would your mother say if she could see you right now , offering money to a girl to sleep with you ? ”
46443	46449	46299	46300	an idiot	1895	“ Holy fuck , Bianca ! ”
46450	46456	46302	46302	I	1777	“ Stop cursing at me ! ”
46468	46484	46457	46457	He	952	“ I never said anything about sleeping with me ! I ’m talking about marriage ! ”
46506	46512	46513	46513	I	1777	“ Oh , I see , ”
46519	46529	46513	46513	I	1777	“ You ’re gay . You need a beard . ”
46542	46550	46551	46551	He	952	“ No . I am not gay . ”
46556	46575	46551	46551	He	952	“ And you know it , because that kiss we had was hotter than the sidewalk in July . ”
46587	46593	46584	46584	I	1777	“ Your metaphors need work . ”
46594	46607	46584	46584	I	1777	“ Excuse me . Hotter than a billy goat with a blowtorch . ”
46608	46634	46584	46584	I	1777	“ That does n’t even make sense . And comparing a lady ’s kiss to anything to do with a goat is just bad manners . ”
46647	46676	46635	46635	His	952	“ You ’re right . I ’ll try it again . That kiss was hotter than a housewife reading Fifty Shades of Grey at the Magic Mike premiere . ”
46681	46684	46685	46685	I	1777	“ Better , ”
46730	46741	46711	46711	He	952	“ Obviously I came at this in the wrong way — ”
46742	46746	46711	46711	He	952	“ You think ? ”
46750	46780	46747	46747	He	952	“ Can I just get a word in edgewise , please ? Let me say my piece , and then you can send me on my way . Deal ? ”
46825	46829	46830	46830	he	952	“ Thank you , ”
46833	46852	46830	46830	he	952	“ Okay . A little backstory . I have a trust . It ’s . . . big . ”
46862	46921	46858	46858	Jackson	487	“ As I was saying , I have a big trust . And no , that ’s not a metaphor . I found out today that to keep my trust and inherit my fortune once my father dies , I need to either work for the family company or get married . By my thirty - fifth birthday . ”
46927	46933	46858	46858	Jackson	487	“ Which is next month . ”
46939	46949	46934	46934	I	1777	“ So go work for the company , dummy ! ”
46977	46992	46962	46962	he	952	“ I ca n’t . I ’ll never go back to Kentucky . Never . ”
46993	46997	47021	47021	His	952	“ Why not ? ”
47010	47020	46998	46998	He	952	“ There ’s nothing for me there but ghosts . ”
47086	47091	47092	47092	I	1777	“ Uh - huh , ”
47095	47136	47092	47092	I	1777	“ So marry some debutante and have your two point five perfect babies and live happily ever after with your country club membership and your polo ponies . I ’m sorry , but I do n’t see the problem here . ”
47158	47176	47155	47155	He	952	“ The problem is that you ’re the only woman I ’ve liked in a long time . ”
47186	47214	47177	47177	He	952	“ And I do n’t want to be poor . I ’d be exceedingly bad at it . For one thing , I ’m not nice enough . ”
47215	47226	47155	47155	He	952	“ How ridiculous . Not all poor people are nice . ”
47230	47254	47227	47227	He	952	“ Really ? Every poor person I ’ve ever met has been extremely nice to me . Well . . . except you . ”
47261	47283	47255	47255	I	1777	“ God , you ’re hopeless . They ’re nice to you because you ’re rich ! They want your money ! ”
47284	47287	47288	47288	He	952	“ Oh . ”
47292	47302	47288	47288	He	952	“ I thought only rich people were like that . ”
47310	47331	47303	47303	I	1777	“ You ’re right . You could n’t be poor . You have no idea what real life is like . ”
47332	47335	47336	47336	he	952	“ Exactly ! ”
47339	47346	47336	47336	he	952	“ So you understand my predicament ! ”
47347	47401	47303	47303	I	1777	“ What I understand is that I have a restaurant full of guests and I ’m standing in a dark alley talking to a delusional rich man about his imaginary problems . You need a bride , run an ad in the paper . You ’d have five thousand responses the first day . ”
47402	47436	47437	47437	Whew	171	“ I told you . You ’re the only woman I ’ve liked in a long time . I do n’t like strangers . I do n’t trust people . Women in particular . ”
47452	47470	47437	47437	Whew	171	“ You just told me I was n’t nice to you . Why would you like me ? ”
47477	47494	47471	47471	His	1777	“ You ’re honest . And real . And you do n’t care about my money — ”
47495	47508	47437	47437	Whew	171	“ Ha ! So you offer me a million dollars of it ? ”
47509	47574	47471	47471	His	1777	“ I was n’t finished . You do n’t care about my money , and you ’re kind , and responsible , and you ’re not afraid to call me on my shit , and you ’re so fucking beautiful it sometimes hurts to look at you , like I ’m gazing into the sun and could go blind if I stare too long . ”
47631	47634	47628	47628	I	1777	“ Oh . ”
47707	47721	47704	47704	I	1777	“ Let me get this straight . You want me to marry you . ”
47722	47725	47704	47704	I	1777	“ Yes . ”
47726	47738	47704	47704	I	1777	“ But I do n’t have to have sex with you . ”
47739	47742	47704	47704	I	1777	“ Right . ”
47743	47758	47704	47704	I	1777	“ If I do n’t marry you , you wo n’t marry anyone else . ”
47759	47762	47704	47704	I	1777	“ Correct . ”
47763	47780	47704	47704	I	1777	“ And there ’s no chance of you going to work for your family ’s company . ”
47787	47790	47781	47781	He	1777	“ None . ”
47791	47832	47704	47704	I	1777	“ So what you ’re basically telling me is that if I do n’t agree to marry you , I ’ll be responsible for you losing all your money and becoming a pauper and ruining the rest of your life . ”
47836	47843	47833	47833	He	1777	“ Well . . . yes . ”
47847	47853	47844	47844	I	1777	“ Gee , no pressure . ”
47867	47886	47854	47854	He	1777	“ It would n’t have to be forever . Just five years and then we could get divorced . ”
47887	47891	47892	47892	I	1777	“ Five years ! ”
47898	47924	47892	47892	I	1777	“ I ’m thirty - one years old , Jackson ; that puts me close to forty by the time you ’re finished with me ! ”
47934	47947	47925	47925	He	1777	“ I think your math is a little off there , Bianca . ”
47948	47974	47975	47975	He	1777	“ What if I want kids ? Have you considered that ? By the time we get divorced , I ’d be an old maid ! ”
47978	48016	47975	47975	He	1777	“ Hardly . And you could always do IVF . I mean , you ’d have enough money . Or get a surrogate . Or adopt . . . why are you looking at me like that ? ”
48017	48116	47975	47975	He	1777	“ Because I ’m having an out - of - body experience . Somehow I ’ve been transported to an alternate universe where a psychotic billionaire is trying to convince me to enter into a sham marriage , give up five years of my life , and forego the possibility of actually falling in love and sharing a future with someone . Someone who loves me for who I am , not what I can do for him . Do you really think any amount of money could convince me to do something so — so — wrong ? ”
48147	48152	48140	48140	he	1777	“ You ’re right . ”
48161	48206	48153	48153	He	1777	“ You ’re absolutely right . I ’m so sorry . This was . . . stupid . Reckless . I should n’t have thought you ’d . . . you ’re not the kind of . . . fuck . Please forgive me . ”
48603	48607	48608	48608	I	1777	“ You okay ? ”
48698	48702	48683	48683	Chemo	173	“ Mrs. Hardwick . ”
48756	48759	48760	48760	I	1777	“ So ? ”
48800	48804	48797	48797	He	80	“ Good news . ”
48823	48868	48819	48819	He	80	“ The scan shows the tumor has shrunk about fifty percent , which is where we needed it to be before we could do surgery . Your body has reacted very well to the chemotherapy drugs , Mrs. Hardwick . How are you feeling ? ”
48873	48883	48869	48869	Mama	1754	“ Like I went twelve rounds with Muhammad Ali . ”
48888	48904	48884	48885	The doctor	686	“ Once chemo is stopped , you ’ll start to feel a whole lot better . ”
48927	48939	48924	48924	I	1777	“ So does this mean she ’s going to be okay ? ”
48961	49084	48940	48941	Doc Halloran	80	“ It means the treatment is working . Which is excellent , mind you . Many times we have to try several different drugs before we see a result . But I do n’t want to sugarcoat anything . After we remove the tumor , we ’re looking at an additional five to fifteen weeks of chemo to get any stray cancer cells that might have been left behind in the lung or chest wall . We also need to consider radiation , depending on the outcome of the surgery . The lymph nodes are only marginally involved , which is good , but we wo n’t really know if the cancer has been contained , or eradicated , for several months . ”
49232	49246	49248	49249	Doc Halloran	80	“ I ’d like to schedule the surgery for the week after next , ”
49319	49323	49308	49308	I	1777	“ Do it . ”
49354	49357	49359	49359	Rayford	1721	“ Sir , ”
49361	49371	49359	49359	Rayford	1721	“ you ’re gon na wear out the rug . ”
49372	49379	49380	49380	I	1777	“ I ’ll buy another one , ”
49617	49625	49626	49626	Rayford	1721	“ Maybe you should have a drink , ”
49633	49645	49626	49626	Rayford	1721	“ So you do n’t scare the poor girl off with all this”—he
49652	49654	49626	49626	Rayford	1721	air—“energy . ”
49655	49661	49662	49662	I	1777	“ My energy ’s fine , ”
49672	49698	49669	49669	Rayford	1721	“ Sure , if you ’re gearin ’ up to ride into battle on your war horse and lop off some heads with an axe . ”
49714	49750	49711	49711	He	1721	“ Have it your way . But do n’t say I did n’t warn you when I open the door and Miss Bianca sees the state you ’re in and turns around and runs off . ”
49751	49761	49762	49762	I	1777	“ She ’s not the running - off type , ”
49765	49797	49762	49762	I	1777	“ She ’s more the light - you - on - fire - and - walk - calmly - away - while - you - burn - to - ashes type . ”
49801	49809	49798	49798	Rayford	1721	“ This is gon na be fun . ”
49818	49846	49810	49810	I	1777	“ Fun ? This is the most bizarre and unbelievably serious thing I ’ve done in my life , and you ’re talking about it being fun ? ”
49850	49858	49847	49847	He	1721	“ I meant for me , sir . ”
49872	49881	49868	49868	Rayford	1721	“ And here ’s the fire starter now ! ”
50099	50119	50121	50121	Bianca	58	“ Are you going to invite me in , or would you prefer we talked in the front yard ? ”
50153	50156	50157	50157	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
50164	50168	50157	50157	I	1777	“ Come in . ”
50283	50293	50294	50294	she	58	“ A three - legged stool and a whip , ”
50312	50322	50305	50305	she	58	“ Is n’t that what every lion tamer needs ? ”
50334	50340	50341	50341	I	1777	“ Thank you , Rayford , ”
50359	50365	50341	50341	I	1777	“ That will be all . ”
50366	50371	50372	50372	he	1721	“ Yes , sir , ”
50413	50426	50408	50408	Bianca	58	“ So , Mr. Boudreaux , are you ready for a Mrs. ? ”
50447	50487	50438	50438	Her	58	“ That makes two of us . And if you do n’t mind , I ’ll have whatever it is you ’re having . My stomach is pitching the kind of dying duck fit only hard liquor can help . ”
50600	50605	50606	50606	she	58	“ Please sit down , ”
50609	50617	50606	50606	she	58	“ You ’re intimidating when you hover . ”
50618	50629	50630	50630	I	1777	“ I ca n’t believe you ’d find anything intimidating , ”
50652	50668	50669	50669	she	58	“ I suppose you ’ll soon be finding out all kinds of things about me , ”
50693	50698	50682	50682	I	1777	“ I ’m worried . ”
50707	50710	50701	50701	she	58	“ Worried ? ”
50714	50718	50711	50711	I	1777	“ About what ? ”
50728	50762	50719	50719	My	1777	“ About this . About what we ’re about to do , if we agree to do it . But mostly . . . about fucking things up and making you hate me . ”
50781	50798	50772	50772	She	58	“ Thank you . I do n’t know why , but that makes me feel better . ”
50908	50912	50905	50905	she	58	“ You shaved . ”
50921	50928	50913	50913	I	1777	“ I know you prefer it . ”
50959	50971	50956	50956	She	58	“ And you ’re wearing a suit . With a tie . ”
50977	50995	50956	50956	She	58	“ I never said I did n’t own any suits . I just said I hate them . ”
50996	51003	50956	50956	She	58	“ But you ’re wearing one . ”
51004	51013	50956	50956	She	58	“ The occasion seemed to call for it . ”
51035	51042	51043	51043	she	58	“ Oh God this is weird ! ”
51051	51055	51043	51043	she	58	“ I know . ”
51108	51118	51101	51101	Jackson	487	“ My mother has lung cancer . Stage three . ”
51146	51227	51143	51143	she	58	“ We ’re broke . She does n’t have insurance . Her doctor wants to do surgery . Chemo has shrunk her tumor , but she needs surgery and possibly radiation , and definitely more chemo after the surgery . All that stuff costs money . A lot of money . I ’ve already burned through the twenty grand you gave me for the charity event , and that was only for the initial rounds of chemo and some prescriptions . ”
51248	51346	51228	51228	She	58	“ There ’s no guarantee the surgery will work , of course , but without the surgery she ’s dead . That ’s it . Finito . Over . Done . Sixty - four years of running a business and raising a child and being a wonderful wife and mother and friend and good citizen and God - fearing churchgoer and taking care of everyone else without a thought to her own needs , and this is what she gets in repayment . Cancer . Like that ’s fair ? Like that ’s how it should be ? ”
51401	51429	51398	51398	Bianca	58	“ My mother is my closest friend . She ’s the best person I ’ve ever known . I ’d do anything for her , you understand ? ”
51438	51441	51442	51442	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
51446	51478	51442	51442	I	1777	“ I understand . You ’ll marry a man you do n’t love and give up five years of your own life so you can have the money to save hers . ”
51492	51513	51489	51489	I	1777	“ That does n’t make you a whore , forgive me for saying that word . It makes you selfless . ”
51529	51557	51514	51514	She	58	“ I do n’t know what it makes me , but I ’ve decided it does n’t matter . I ’m willing to do whatever it takes . ”
51629	51640	51625	51625	I	1777	“ Tell me what will make this easier for you . ”
51692	51700	51689	51689	she	58	“ Knowing what to expect will help . ”
51727	51736	51724	51724	I	1777	“ Sex is n’t part of the contract . ”
51758	51766	51755	51755	She	58	“ So we ’ll have a contract ? ”
51770	51825	51767	51767	I	1777	“ My attorney will draw it up based on whatever agreement we make , and you can have your attorney review it . The only nonnegotiables are the five - year time period prior to a divorce , a nondisclosure , and that you have to live here for the entirety of the marriage . ”
51830	51836	51837	51837	I	1777	“ Married people live together , ”
51889	51912	51886	51886	I	1777	“ There are eight guest bedrooms here , besides the master bedroom and Cody ’s room . You can have your pick . ”
52014	52023	52011	52011	She	58	“ I do n’t want a million dollars , ”
52072	52077	52078	52078	she	58	“ What I want , ”
52081	52119	52078	52078	she	58	“ is for you to pay for all my mother ’s medical bills , prescriptions , any hospitalizations and surgeries , and whatever other necessary care she needs , until she beats the cancer or . . . ”
52136	52140	52133	52133	I	1777	“ Keep talking . ”
52146	52151	52141	52141	She	58	“ That ’s it . ”
52170	52180	52166	52166	I	1777	“ What do you mean , that ’s it ? ”
52186	52238	52181	52181	She	58	“ Anything else and I ’ll feel dirty . This is n’t about greed or getting rich . I love my life , if you want to know the truth . And if I ’m being perfectly honest , all your money does n’t seem to have made you very happy . ”
52244	52356	52239	52239	She	58	“ The only problem I have is that I ca n’t pay for my mother ’s cancer treatments . We could run up a huge bill and let the hospital come after us , but then we ’re looking at bankruptcy court and debt collectors and maybe even having what few assets she owns being seized . And my mama is too proud to even tell her friends she ’s sick — she’d rather die than go bankrupt or be a burden on anyone . If she lost her house and had to move in with me , she ’d stick her head in the oven the first chance she got . ”
52376	52395	52373	52373	I	1777	“ There must be something you want for yourself . Something for the restaurant , or your future — ”
52396	52403	52404	52404	she	58	“ My future is my concern , ”
52413	52452	52404	52404	she	58	“ You ’re buying a five - year pretend wife , and I ’m buying a chance for my mother to live . That ’s it . That ’s the deal , or we do n’t have one . ”
52497	52502	52503	52503	I	1777	“ How about this , ”
52506	52606	52503	52503	I	1777	“ I ’ll put the money in a trust and name you the sole trustee . That way it will be protected , and you can have access to the money whenever you need it , instead of having to rely on me . I think it would be . . . awkward for you to have to come to me with every bill . Then whatever is left over when your mother gets better , you can do with as you choose . Buy your mother a bigger house , give it to charity , whatever you want . ”
52619	52632	52608	52608	she	58	“ That ’s the deal , or we do n’t have one . ”
52666	52678	52662	52662	She	58	“ All right , Mr. Boudreaux . You have a deal . ”
52709	52724	52706	52706	I	1777	“ How many times do I have to tell you to call me Jackson . ”
52737	52764	52734	52734	she	58	“ I suppose if I ’m going to be your wife , I ought to have a nickname for you . Does anyone call you Jax ? ”
52808	52811	52812	52812	I	1777	“ No , ”
52819	52831	52812	52812	I	1777	“ No one calls me Jax . No one but you . ”
53232	53250	53251	53251	I	1777	“ He ’s so charming I could n’t help but fall in love with him , Mama ! ”
53319	53323	53324	53324	I	1777	“ Unplanned pregnancy ? ”
53346	53374	53375	53375	I	1777	“ Not unless you want to pretend you ’ve been sleeping with a man everyone thinks you hate and then fake a miscarriage in a few months . ”
53389	53436	53375	53375	I	1777	“ Temporary insanity ? Hmm . Probably the most reasonable explanation , other than suffering a recent head injury . Lord , this is bad . How am I gon na get anyone to believe I married him for love when all we do is fight ? ”
53454	53461	53440	53450	a young black man wearing a New Orleans Saints cap backward	1006	“ Slap , slap , kiss . ”
53469	53473	53464	53464	I	1777	“ Excuse me ? ”
53486	53547	53474	53474	He	1006	“ It ’s a popular film and TV trope where the writers put two characters who ca n’t stand each other in close quarters and let them verbally spar , until one of them suddenly kisses the other , and they both realize they ’ve had mad sexual chemistry all along and the fighting was just a cover for it . ”
53560	53601	53557	53557	He	1006	“ Just brainstorming with you . I ’m a writer . Or trying to be . I spend lots of time studying this trope stuff . It ’s actually how stories are told . Even Shakespeare is filled with tropes . ”
53606	53612	53602	53602	I	1777	“ You do n’t say . ”
53613	53617	53618	53618	he	1006	“ Oh yeah , ”
53627	53717	53618	53618	he	1006	“ For instance , Much Ado About Nothing ? That play is stuffed so full of tropes you could choke on them ! But the bottom line is that two of the main characters , Beatrice and Benedick , have this history of seriously hating on each other , but everyone else can see they ’re perfectly matched . I mean , the opposite of love is n’t hate . It ’s indifference . They would n’t fight so much if they did n’t care so much , right ? ”
53721	53735	53718	53718	I	1777	“ It sounds like a really dysfunctional relationship , if you ask me . ”
53743	53774	53718	53718	I	1777	“ Yeah , but all the best ones are . It ’s not true love if you do n’t want to kick his teeth in every once in a while . ”
53855	53865	53866	53866	I	1777	“ Why that low - down , dirty dog ! ”
53917	53924	53926	53926	Mama	1754	“ Well here she is now ! ”
53954	53971	53949	53949	Trace	79	“ Your ears must ’ve been burning , chère , we were just talking about you ! ”
53977	53994	53972	53972	I	1777	“ I do n’t know about my ears , but my ass is certainly on fire ! ”
53995	53998	53999	53999	Mama	1754	“ Bianca ! ”
54012	54029	54004	54004	She	1754	“ I did not raise you to speak like that ! You apologize right this minute ! ”
54030	54050	54052	54052	Trace	79	“ It ’s all right , Mrs. Hardwick . It ’s probably just the new influence in her life , ”
54064	54083	54059	54059	He	79	“ I hear that Jackson Boudreaux fella Bianca ’s been spending time with has really earned his nickname . ”
54084	54091	54092	54092	I	1777	“ One more word , Trace , ”
54095	54123	54092	54092	I	1777	“ and I ’m gon na get my daddy ’s gun out of the garage and turn you from a rooster to a hen with one shot . ”
54124	54143	54144	54144	Mama	1754	“ Now stop it , Bianca , I wo n’t have this kind of behavior in my home ! ”
54188	54199	54200	54200	I	1777	“ What are you doing out of bed , Mama ? ”
54220	54275	54210	54210	She	1754	“ I ’m sick of being in bed , Bianca , and I ’m feeling a little better today , so I got up and had breakfast . Then Trace called and asked if he could come by , and I was in the mood for a little visiting , so I said yes . ”
54276	54293	54295	54295	Trace	79	“ It ’s real nice you ’re taking such good care of your mama , Bianca , ”
54300	54303	54297	54297	I	1777	“ What ? ”
54304	54312	54313	54313	he	79	“ Since she ’s been so sick , ”
54316	54324	54313	54313	he	79	“ You know , with the flu ? ”
54393	54405	54390	54390	I	1777	“ Right . The flu . It ’s been going around . ”
54420	54429	54390	54390	I	1777	“ So you were just leaving , right ? ”
54503	54518	54500	54500	He	79	“ Actually I was just telling your mama about the new business I started . ”
54601	54603	54599	54603	the lucky “ investor ”	2194	“ investor ”
54639	54649	54635	54635	I	1777	“ Another new business . How thrilling for you . ”
54659	54682	54656	54656	He	79	“ It is , actually . It ’s the one we always talked about starting together . You remember , bumble bee ? ”
54689	54692	54693	54693	I	1777	“ No , ”
54711	54763	54702	54702	He	79	“ Sure you do ! A restaurant . Got a few investors with some serious cheese , just signed the lease on the space . We ’ll be opening up next month . Right down the street from your place , as a matter of fact . We ’ll be neighbors ! ”
54776	54784	54773	54773	Mama	1754	“ Why that ’s wonderful , Trace ! ”
54882	54901	54871	54871	I	1777	“ Is n’t that nice . Would you mind if I talked to you outside for a minute ? ”
55011	55015	55016	55016	he	79	“ Of course , ”
55032	55043	55025	55025	He	79	“ Always a pleasure to see you , Mrs. Hardwick . ”
55044	55050	55051	55051	she	1754	“ And you , Trace , ”
55131	55150	55113	55113	he	79	“ I was just about to ask your mama for some of her recipes when you came in . ”
55195	55224	55192	55192	I	1777	“ If you ever come near her again , I ’ll break into your house when you ’re not home and replace all your shampoo with hair remover . ”
55242	55331	55234	55234	I	1777	“ You ’re a liar . And a cheater . And I do n’t care how much you screech about finding God , a leopard does n’t change his spots . I know all your tricks , Trace Adams . I know all your tells . And I know that you getting into the restaurant business has nothing to do with new investors and everything to do with trying to outdo me and prove that I made a mistake when I kicked your sorry behind to the curb . ”
55335	55341	55332	55332	Trace	79	“ Well , you did . ”
55349	55354	55342	55342	I	1777	“ You ’re unbelievable . ”
55379	55399	55376	55376	He	79	“ I know I made my mistakes , too , but I want to put all that behind us . ”
55405	55442	55376	55376	He	79	“ C’m on , bumble bee . I know you still have feelings for me , or you never would ’ve kissed that asshole in the car the other night . That ’s not your style . ”
55463	55470	55460	55460	I	1777	“ That asshole is my fiancé ! ”
55488	55494	55495	55495	He	79	“ The fuck you say ? ”
55508	55522	55495	55495	He	79	“ You heard me . We ’re engaged . We ’re getting married . ”
55544	55567	55529	55529	He	79	“ Huh . Never thought I ’d see the day that Miss High and Mighty turned into a gold - digging whore . ”
55614	55635	55597	55597	I	1777	“ There he is . There ’s the Trace I know . Welcome back , player . Now get lost ! ”
55668	55691	55658	55658	He	79	“ How much he payin ’ you , Bianca ? How much does it cost to get you to suck a dick ? ”
55709	55752	55705	55705	I	1777	“ If you come near me or my mama again , I ’ll call the police . And then I ’ll call my future husband . And believe me , Trace , you ’ll want the police to get to you first . ”
55949	55954	55939	55939	He	79	“ Oh . Hello . ”
55986	55993	55959	55959	He	79	“ Is this a bad time ? ”
56011	56022	56008	56008	I	1777	“ It ’s fine . They ’re contained for now . ”
56043	56051	56008	56008	I	1777	“ Let ’s go into my office . ”
56142	56150	56134	56134	He	79	“ Looks like a bomb went off . ”
56180	56185	56175	56175	His	79	“ From an admirer ? ”
56189	56200	56186	56186	I	1777	“ If you can call Satan ’s spawn an admirer . ”
56241	56269	56228	56228	He	79	“ I ’m sorry , bumble bee . I did n’t mean what I said yesterday . Please call me , we need to talk . Trace . ”
56297	56301	56294	56294	He	79	“ What happened ? ”
56313	56327	56302	56302	I	1777	“ We had a little run - in at my mother ’s house . ”
56328	56334	56335	56335	he	79	“ A run - in ? ”
56351	56390	56302	56302	I	1777	“ Long story short , I stopped by Mama ’s on my way to the restaurant , and he was there . I told him we were getting married , and he called me the c - word . ”
56412	56420	56409	56409	I	1777	“ That ’s not the worst part . ”
56447	56454	56455	56455	I	1777	“ He ’s opening a restaurant , ”
56469	56493	56455	56455	I	1777	“ Down the street . As a big f - you to me and all the plans we made to do it together . ”
56535	56595	56532	56532	I	1777	“ It ’s just another one of his childish games . There ’s nothing he ca n’t stand as much as being ignored , and he knew this would get my attention . He wants me to obsess over it . Which is why the only thing I can do is act like it does n’t get to me . ”
56600	56605	56596	56596	Jackson	487	“ We ’ll see . ”
56620	56629	56596	56596	Jackson	487	“ I ’m not condoning violence , Jackson . ”
56630	56654	56655	56655	His	191	“ Who said anything about violence ? There are ways to deal with this kind of situation that do n’t involve shedding blood . ”
56661	56688	56655	56655	His	191	“ Even though I ’d very much like to rip his head off and shove it up his own ass for what he said to you . ”
56721	56738	56709	56709	I	1777	“ Sit . Please . You ’re making the room seem smaller than it already is . ”
56804	56810	56811	56811	he	191	“ I brought the contract , ”
56824	56833	56811	56811	he	191	“ Bianca . Your face just went white . ”
56843	56851	56836	56836	I	1777	“ That would certainly be a feat . ”
56861	56869	56858	56858	He	191	“ Do you want to see it ? ”
56904	56917	56918	56918	he	191	“ You need to have your attorney review it before you sign , ”
56922	56930	56918	56918	he	191	“ I do n’t have an attorney . ”
56931	56936	56918	56918	he	191	“ Then get one . ”
56937	56947	56918	56918	he	191	“ I ca n’t afford an attorney , Jax . ”
56980	56987	56973	56973	I	1777	“ Do I make you uncomfortable ? ”
56988	56995	57021	57021	He	191	“ Do n’t change the subject . ”
56996	57020	56973	56973	I	1777	“ It ’s a legitimate question . If we ’re going to be married , I should probably know these kinds of things . ”
57030	57042	57021	57021	He	191	“ You ’ve made me uncomfortable since the moment we met . ”
57090	57099	57087	57087	I	1777	“ I ’ve been thinking about the rings . ”
57120	57140	57117	57117	he	191	“ I ca n’t concentrate with these fucking roses staring down at me like a dozen bloody middle fingers . ”
57152	57196	57145	57145	I	1777	“ I was going to toss them in the garbage as soon as they arrived this morning , but Eeny said she ’d take them . Something about a ritual involving rose petals and goat blood . I did n’t ask for details . ”
57240	57243	57244	57244	he	191	“ Better , ”
57247	57253	57244	57244	he	191	“ The rings . Shoot . ”
57261	57293	57256	57256	I	1777	“ I want a five - carat flawless Tiffany brilliant - cut center stone with a pair of flawless one - carat stones flanking it , set in a platinum band . ”
57304	57322	57301	57301	I	1777	“ You got me . A simple gold band will do . What should I get you ? ”
57335	57344	57323	57323	He	191	“ You want to get me a ring ? ”
57345	57374	57323	57323	He	191	“ I ’m not marrying a man who refuses to wear my ring . If we ’re doing this , we ’re doing it right . Jewelry included . ”
57375	57381	57323	57323	He	191	“ Why does it matter ? ”
57407	57411	57395	57416	every other female who looked at him to see that small gold “ off - limits ” sign on his ring finger	1050	“ off - limits ”
57495	57515	57492	57492	He	191	“ Whatever conversation you ’re having with yourself , I ’d love to join in . It looks fascinating . ”
57533	57549	57530	57530	I	1777	“ I was just . . . wondering . . . about the sex stuff . ”
57595	57600	57601	57601	he	191	“ What about it ? ”
57632	57646	57623	57623	I	1777	“ Um . What if you get a girlfriend ? How do we — ”
57647	57652	57601	57601	he	191	“ I wo n’t . ”
57665	57708	57661	57661	I	1777	“ You ca n’t know that . You could meet someone the day after we get married and fall madly in love with her . We should talk about what will happen in that scenario . Would she come live with us ? ”
57753	57761	57762	57762	he	191	“ There wo n’t be any girlfriends , ”
57765	57779	57762	57762	he	191	“ There wo n’t be anyone else while I ’m married to you . ”
57801	57818	57790	57790	I	1777	“ So the ‘ no sex ’ clause is actually like a ‘ celibacy ’ clause ? ”
57836	57846	57819	57819	He	191	“ You should go over it with your attorney . ”
57847	57857	57819	57819	He	191	“ I want to go over it with you . ”
57871	57894	57860	57860	his	191	“ It clarifies that there ’s no expectation of sex between us . It ’s not a requirement to fulfill the contract . ”
57903	57912	57895	57895	I	1777	“ So , then , it ’s voluntary . ”
57969	57980	57966	57966	I	1777	“ I mean , it ’s not against the rules . ”
58002	58014	57998	57998	He	191	“ Why , Future Mrs. Boudreaux , are you propositioning me ? ”
58050	58053	58054	58054	I	1777	“ Sorry , ”
58057	58076	58054	58054	I	1777	“ This is just all very strange . I suppose I ’m nervous . Forget I even asked . ”
58077	58094	58105	58105	He	191	“ Oh , no . You ’re not getting off that easily . Look at me . ”
58108	58118	58105	58105	He	191	“ When was the last time you had sex ? ”
58126	58134	58135	58135	I	1777	“ That ’s none of your business , ”
58150	58164	58147	58147	He	191	“ The last time I had sex was more than four years ago . ”
58170	58180	58147	58147	He	191	“ I mean , with anyone other than myself . ”
58192	58197	58184	58184	I	1777	“ No ! Really ? ”
58198	58201	58147	58147	He	191	“ Really . ”
58202	58208	58184	58184	I	1777	“ Are you a monk ? ”
58224	58235	58209	58209	He	191	“ Do you get the impression I ’m a monk ? ”
58269	58292	58258	58258	I	1777	“ Did you . . . go through . . . um , a time when you were n’t sure . . . ”
58301	58313	58293	58293	Jackson	487	“ I already told you I ’m not gay , Bianca . ”
58317	58322	58314	58314	I	1777	“ So . . . ”
58326	58382	58323	58323	He	191	“ I ’m not bisexual , either , if that ’s where you ’re heading ! I ’m not confused about which sex I prefer , and I do n’t have a disease I ’m trying not to spread ! I just have n’t had a girlfriend for a while , for Christ ’s sake ! ”
58402	58428	58388	58388	he	191	“ Okay , I hear you , you ’re not confused , you ’re not diseased , you ’re just unusually . . . nonsexual . ”
58521	58531	58518	58518	He	191	“ Tell me if this feels nonsexual to you . ”
58797	58800	58801	58801	I	1777	“ Oh , ”
58811	58819	58804	58804	His	191	“ Yes , oh . Stop talking . ”
59030	59037	59038	59038	I	1777	“ We ’re not done yet , ”
59140	59152	59155	59155	Hoyt	267	“ Boss ? Sorry to interrupt . Meat delivery finally arrived . ”
59170	59174	59175	59175	I	1777	“ Thank you , ”
59188	59195	59175	59175	I	1777	“ I ’ll be right out . ”
59240	59247	59237	59237	I	1777	“ I have to . . . ”
59248	59257	59258	59258	His	191	“ I know . Give me a second . ”
59308	59315	59293	59293	He	191	“ What are these scars from ? ”
59348	59355	59345	59345	he	191	“ A man - eating shark . ”
59467	59475	59464	59464	I	1777	“ Well . That was . . . ”
59507	59534	59504	59504	he	191	“ Get the contract reviewed by an attorney as soon as possible . Send the invoice to me . And I need to meet your mother . ”
59646	59650	59651	59651	he	191	“ Miss Hardwick , ”
59673	59681	59651	59651	he	191	“ This is . . . unusual . ”
59692	59698	59682	59682	My	1777	“ You do n’t say ! ”
59699	59710	59711	59711	he	191	“ I ’ve never seen anything quite like this before , ”
59729	59744	59745	59745	he	191	“ I assume that you ’re entering into this agreement due to . . . ”
59752	59756	59745	59745	he	191	“ Financial problems ? ”
59757	59767	59745	59745	he	191	“ Bingo . So give me the bad news . ”
59772	59791	59768	59768	He	191	“ You ’re marrying a man solely for his money . What other bad news do you need ? ”
59827	59843	59844	59844	He	191	“ I ’m talking about the contract . What ’s bad in there for me ? ”
59864	59914	59861	59861	I	1777	“ I know . You can stop judging me now , okay ? Just tell me if there ’s anything in the contract we should counter . For instance , the part where it talks about me not having to have sex with him . Is that in order ? ”
59940	59943	59944	59944	he	191	“ Yes , ”
59952	59979	59944	59944	he	191	“ But we should counter for more money . One million dollars for five years is only two hundred thousand dollars per year . That works out to”—he
59989	60034	59986	59986	I	1777	up—“five hundred fifty - five dollars per day . Give or take . In my professional opinion , that ’s not nearly enough compensation for the length of time involved . You should be asking for five million at least , ideally double that . ”
60044	60058	60035	60035	I	1777	“ The amount stays the same . That ’s not the important part . ”
60092	60115	60082	60082	he	191	“ I do n’t concur , Miss Hardwick . When you ’re marrying for money , money is the only important part . ”
60119	60124	60116	60116	I	1777	“ It ’s complicated . ”
60125	60131	60116	60116	I	1777	“ Uncomplicate it for me . ”
60143	60188	60137	60137	he	191	“ I ’m sorry , Miss Hardwick , but my advice to you is not to sign this document . It is n’t in your best interest . You could conceivably make one million dollars in five years with the income from your restaurant . ”
60218	60251	60206	60206	I	1777	“ Aside from the money , is there anything else in there I should worry about ? Any language you want to tweak ? Any offensive codicils we should remove ? Anything ? ”
60269	60296	60266	60266	he	191	“ A few minor points . It ’s very straightforward , actually , and fair , if such a word could be applied to this situation . ”
60297	60300	60301	60301	I	1777	“ Good , ”
60313	60324	60306	60306	I	1777	“ Can you have the changes to me by tomorrow ? ”
60335	60341	60325	60325	He	191	“ May I say something ? ”
60342	60345	60325	60325	He	191	“ No . ”
60361	60405	60325	60325	He	191	“ You ’re an attractive young woman , Miss Hardwick . You also seem intelligent and pragmatic , a combination that in my experience is rarer than a unicorn sighting . There ’s no need for someone like you to sell yourself short . ”
60426	60436	60422	60422	I	1777	“ Just have the changes to me by tomorrow , ”
60562	60565	60574	60574	He	191	“ Hello ? ”
60566	60573	60574	60574	He	191	“ Bianca . It ’s Jackson . ”
60582	60593	60574	60574	He	191	“ As if I could n’t tell from the growl . ”
60594	60615	60574	60574	He	191	“ Why were n’t you answering ? I called the front desk and Pepper insisted you were in your office . ”
60631	60646	60616	60616	I	1777	“ I am in my office . I ’m just . . . thinking . ”
60653	60658	60673	60673	his	191	“ That sounds ominous . ”
60659	60668	60673	60673	his	191	“ I had an attorney review the contract . ”
60680	60697	60673	60673	his	191	“ Please contain your excitement . I do n’t think my ego can handle such enthusiasm . ”
60719	60724	60716	60716	He	191	“ Talk to me . ”
60739	60751	60725	60725	I	1777	“ Just prewedding jitters , dear , nothing to worry about . ”
60766	60774	60752	60752	His	191	“ Getting cold feet , are we ? ”
60796	60813	60787	60787	I	1777	“ Are you deliberately talking about me in first - person plural pronoun to irritate me ? ”
60814	60834	60778	60778	his	191	“ I only have to breathe in your presence to irritate you . Now tell me what ’s wrong . ”
60849	60878	60835	60835	I	1777	“ It ’s a little overwhelming , this whole thing we ’re doing . I never imagined getting married would be like applying for a line of credit . ”
60879	60886	60887	60887	he	191	“ It ’s always like that , ”
60891	60897	60887	60887	he	191	“ What else is wrong ? ”
60913	60920	60903	60903	He	191	“ Are you speaking from experience ? ”
60933	60940	60926	60926	I	1777	“ You ’ve been married before ? ”
60955	60963	60964	60964	He	191	“ No . I have . Not . ”
60999	61006	60964	60964	He	191	“ Are you lying to me ? ”
61035	61051	60964	60964	He	191	“ I. Will . Never . Lie to you . Never . Do you understand ? ”
61062	61077	61055	61055	Poking	196	“ Sorry . It just sounded like there was more to what you said . ”
61105	61111	61102	61102	he	191	“ I was engaged once . ”
61146	61150	61132	61132	My	1777	“ What happened ? ”
61151	61161	61162	61162	he	191	“ She did n’t love me is what happened , ”
61165	61173	61162	61162	he	191	“ She was only after my money ! ”
61200	61207	61208	61208	he	191	“ It ’s different with us , ”
61220	61225	61208	61208	he	191	“ How , exactly ? ”
61234	61240	61226	61226	His	191	“ This time I know . ”
61273	61276	61277	61277	I	1777	“ Jax , ”
61282	61286	61277	61277	I	1777	“ Oh God . ”
61287	61313	61314	61314	His	191	“ It ’s ancient history , Bianca . I ’m over it . I would n’t have even mentioned it if you had n’t asked . ”
61324	61350	61314	61314	His	191	“ And I ’m the one who offered this deal , remember ? This was my idea . So do n’t blame yourself for anything . ”
61408	61413	61414	61414	I	1777	“ This is crazy , ”
61439	61446	61430	61430	I	1777	“ We ca n’t do this . ”
61447	61470	61414	61414	I	1777	“ Is that what you ’re going to tell your mother ? That you ca n’t get the money for her surgery ? ”
61486	61493	61494	61494	I	1777	“ That is so not fair ! ”
61504	61510	61511	61511	he	1777	“ Life is n’t fair , ”
61515	61592	61511	61511	he	1777	“ This is a business deal , Bianca . A good one for both of us . We ’re not doing favors for each other . No one is getting taken advantage of here . We ’re going into it with our eyes open , fully informed and consenting , with an exit strategy that ’s painless and precise . Which is a hell of a lot more than most people can say about their marriages . ”
61702	61708	61699	61699	Jackson	487	“ What was that noise ? ”
61709	61719	61725	61725	he	1777	“ My head and the desk getting better acquainted . ”
61747	61759	61725	61725	he	1777	“ Funny , I never pictured you as a drama queen . ”
61778	61786	61787	61787	I	1777	“ So what ’s the next step ? ”
61797	61806	61787	61787	I	1777	“ Do you own or rent your home ? ”
61821	61824	61816	61816	he	1777	“ Rent . ”
61825	61844	61787	61787	I	1777	“ Give notice . We need to have you transferred to Rivendell by my birthday on the sixteenth . ”
61855	61867	61845	61845	He	1777	“ What about my things ? Furniture , clothes , books ? ”
61868	61913	61816	61816	he	1777	“ Pack what you want to keep , and leave the rest . I ’ll send over moving boxes and arrange for a storage unit . If your landlord charges removal fees for anything you leave behind , I ’ll take care of it . ”
61926	61933	61923	61923	Jackson	487	“ Spit it out , Bianca . ”
61934	61945	61845	61845	He	1777	“ And the wedding itself ? When will that happen ? ”
61946	61969	61923	61923	Jackson	487	“ As soon as you meet my parents . Ideally we ’ll go this weekend , but if you need to arrange — ”
61970	61979	61845	61845	He	1777	“ Wait . Meet your parents ? Go ? ”
61985	62000	61980	61980	His	1777	“ We need to make a quick trip to Kentucky before we get married . ”
62015	62030	62005	62005	he	1777	“ Oh Lord . Your parents have to approve me , do n’t they ? ”
62040	62053	62037	62037	I	1777	“ I have to audition for the role of your fake wife ? ”
62054	62068	62031	62031	His	1777	“ It ’s just a formality . They ’re going to love you . ”
62177	62191	62193	62193	Jackson	487	“ I know you ’re thinking again because I can smell something burning , ”
62208	62221	62222	62222	I	1777	“ I can have Eeny cover for me for a few days , ”
62263	62280	62299	62299	DAVINA	58	“ Good . We ’ll leave Friday , then . When can I meet your mother ? ”
62292	62298	62289	62289	I	1777	“ I ’ll find out . ”
62656	62665	62622	62622	BIANCA	58	“ Hi , Mama . How are you ? ”
62677	62698	62649	62649	She	390	“ I told you this morning I ’m feeling good today , chère . You worry about me too much . ”
62699	62704	62649	62649	She	390	“ That ’s good . ”
62726	62734	62722	62722	She	390	“ Bianca ? What ’s the matter ? ”
62751	62756	62735	62735	I	1777	“ Uh . . . ”
62772	62783	62767	62767	I	1777	“ There ’s someone I ’d like you to meet . ”
62792	62798	62784	62784	She	390	“ Who , Jackson Boudreaux ? ”
62814	62820	62811	62811	I	1777	“ How did you know ? ”
62821	62866	62867	62867	Eeny	954	“ Sweetheart , I ’ve known Eeny for going on fifty years . Did you think she would n’t call me when a man barged into your kitchen and announced you were getting married like you ’d just won the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes ? ”
62891	62924	62888	62888	Mama	1754	“ Well , he might have a reputation for being too big for his britches , but the man must have some sense in his head to fall in love with you . ”
62968	63011	62963	62963	Her	954	“ Bring him by tomorrow at ten o’clock . And be prepared to leave for a few minutes so I can give him the business . He does n’t get to marry into this family unless he ’s good enough for you . ”
63126	63134	63135	63135	I	1777	“ Only one way to find out , ”
63230	63242	63243	63243	she	1754	“ Doc Halloran ’s office called yesterday to confirm the surgery , ”
63247	63253	63254	63254	I	1777	“ Next Wednesday at nine , ”
63259	63263	63254	63254	I	1777	“ I remember . ”
63293	63300	63254	63254	I	1777	“ In case anything goes wrong — ”
63306	63312	63313	63313	I	1777	“ Nothing will go wrong ! ”
63325	63370	63318	63318	She	1754	“ As I was saying . In case anything goes wrong , I ’ve gathered all my important documents and put them in a binder . It ’s blue . I ’ll leave it on the kitchen table before we go to the hospital . ”
63380	63383	63371	63371	I	1777	“ Documents ? ”
63384	63407	63371	63371	I	1777	“ My will . The title to the house . Copies of insurance policies and bank statements . You know , documents . ”
63421	63426	63428	63428	Mama	1754	“ Oh , chère , ”
63431	63457	63428	63428	Mama	1754	“ Dying is n’t the worst thing that ’s ever happened to me . It ’s just the only thing I wo n’t live through . ”
63458	63469	63470	63470	I	1777	“ How many times do I have to tell you ? ”
63477	63483	63470	63470	I	1777	“ You ’re not dying ! ”
63515	63520	63521	63521	I	1777	“ It ’s him ! ”
63547	63555	63556	63556	Mama	1754	“ Well go answer it , child , ”
63672	63678	63668	63668	He	1117	“ Bianca . Good morning . ”
63702	63705	63706	63706	I	1777	“ Jax , ”
63724	63730	63714	63714	His	1117	“ May I come in ? ”
63764	63771	63756	63756	I	1777	“ Of course . Please enter . ”
63810	63814	63815	63815	he	1117	“ Mrs. Hardwick , ”
63821	63841	63815	63815	he	1117	“ It ’s a pleasure to meet you , ma’am . Thank you for inviting me to your home . ”
63864	63899	63856	63856	She	390	“ Forgive me for not standing , Mr. Boudreaux , but I ’ve recently been ill and I ’m a little loosey - goosey on my feet , if you know what I mean . ”
63936	63955	63922	63922	She	390	“ Goodness ! The air must be thin up there , son . Please , take a seat . ”
63971	63979	63981	63981	Jackson	487	“ This is for you , ma’am , ”
64017	64020	64021	64021	Mama	1754	“ Oh . ”
64037	64054	64029	64029	She	1754	“ Why , African violets are my favorite ! I have n’t seen these in years ! ”
64066	64075	64055	64055	She	1754	“ Bianca , did you think of this ? ”
64085	64096	64081	64081	Jackson	487	“ Your daughter is always thinking of you , ma’am . ”
64155	64168	64143	64143	Mama	1754	“ What a lovely surprise . You ’ve just made my day . ”
64189	64214	64182	64182	she	1754	“ What can I offer you to drink , Mr. Boudreaux ? Coffee ? Water ? Something stronger , maybe , an Absinthe Suissesse ? ”
64215	64232	64269	64269	Mama	1754	“ Nothing for me , thank you , ma’am . And please , call me Jackson . ”
64252	64268	64249	64249	Jackson	487	“ I understand Bianca gets her talent in the kitchen from you , Mrs. Hardwick . ”
64278	64323	64269	64269	Mama	1754	“ Oh , I taught her a thing or two , but she ’s got talents I never had . Creativity , that ’s the mark of a true artist ! Like the spring menu she put together for her restaurant , for example . ”
64331	64352	64324	64324	She	1754	“ Would n’t you say that was a stroke of genius , Jackson , all those recipes featuring Boudreaux Bourbon ? ”
64359	64376	64356	64356	Jackson	487	“ The menu is incredible , but I think her true genius is actually with people . ”
64386	64398	64382	64382	His	1127	“ She knows how to make them feel like they matter . ”
64504	64507	64509	64509	Mama	1754	“ Bianca , ”
64524	64539	64540	64540	She	1754	“ Would you mind putting these in my bathroom and giving them a drink ? ”
64546	64581	64540	64540	She	1754	“ And see if you can find that old photo album from your school days ; I want to show Jackson those pictures from when you won the spelling bee in the fifth grade . ”
64587	64614	64540	64540	She	1754	“ You might have to rummage around in those bookcases in the office for a while , I ca n’t remember exactly where I put it . ”
64847	64854	64855	64855	I	1777	“ Slap , slap , kiss , ”
64861	64870	64855	64855	I	1777	“ And make it sound believable , Bianca ! ”
64956	64964	64965	64965	I	1777	“ Could n’t find the photo album , ”
64973	64981	64965	64965	I	1777	“ It ’s probably in the garage . ”
64982	64985	64987	64987	Mama	1754	“ Hmm , ”
64989	64996	64987	64987	Mama	1754	“ Well , perhaps another time . ”
65109	65126	65104	65104	Mama	1754	“ She gets it from her father , that flush . That and her stubborn streak . ”
65130	65144	65104	65104	Mama	1754	“ She ’s stubborn ? Gosh , ma’am , I had n’t noticed . ”
65236	65262	65222	65222	I	1777	“ Well . It ’s been so lovely visiting with you , Jackson , but I ’m afraid I ’m feeling a little tired now . ”
65279	65290	65291	65291	I	1777	“ Are you okay ? What can I get you ? ”
65304	65340	65291	65291	I	1777	“ Nothing at all , chère , nothing at all . I ’m just going to go back to bed for a spell . Rest these old bones . Would you lend me a hand ? ”
65376	65385	65387	65387	Jackson	487	“ It ’s been wonderful to meet you , ”
65404	65416	65392	65392	He	1146	“ I can see where Bianca gets her beauty and brains . ”
65417	65429	65430	65430	Mama	1754	“ And I can see why she likes you so much , ”
65434	65468	65430	65430	Mama	1754	“ You remind me an awful lot of her daddy . Crème brûlée , I always called him . Hard as nails on the outside , but inside all soft and gooey sweet . ”
65474	65477	65469	65469	I	1777	“ Mama ! ”
65478	65489	65492	65492	she	390	“ Oh hush , child , you embarrass too easily . ”
65495	65516	65492	65492	she	390	“ I can trust you to take care of my baby , now , ca n’t I , Jackson Boudreaux ? ”
65579	65590	65575	65575	He	77	“ You can trust me with her life , ma’am . ”
65651	65663	65664	65664	Mama	1754	“ Would you just help me to the bedroom , chère ? ”
65667	65671	65645	65645	Her	1754	“ Of course . ”
65672	65685	65686	65686	Jackson	487	“ I ’ll wait for you outside , Bianca . Mrs. Hardwick . ”
65710	65718	65686	65686	Jackson	487	“ I hope to see you soon . ”
65772	65781	65767	65767	Mama	1754	“ I owe you an apology , Bianca . ”
65782	65789	65790	65790	I	1777	“ What are you talking about ? ”
65801	65828	65796	65796	She	1754	“ I overheard what Trace said to you the other day , out on the sidewalk after you both left . I was wrong about him . ”
65829	65834	65835	65835	I	1777	“ Oh , Mama , ”
65858	65868	65855	65855	she	1754	“ I heard what you told him , too , ”
65900	65931	65878	65879	That asshole	2206	“ I thought you were just being spiteful , which he deserved , do n’t get me wrong . But Jackson Boudreaux just asked for my permission to marry you . ”
65976	66049	65973	65973	She	1778	“ Do n’t look so traumatized , baby , I said yes . It seems awful fast , but who am I to judge ? It was the same way for me and your daddy . And you ’ve always had your head screwed on straight . I know you would n’t want to marry him unless you were in love , even if you have been tight - lipped about it . ”
66075	66082	66072	66072	I	1777	“ Slap , slap , kiss . ”
66095	66122	66083	66083	She	1778	“ You mean the old romance trope where two total opposites fight like cats and dogs until they suddenly realize they ’re crazy about each other ? ”
66153	66156	66157	66157	I	1777	“ Exactly ! ”
66163	66170	66160	66160	She	1778	“ Makes perfect sense to me . ”
66325	66342	66343	66343	I	1777	“ I did n’t think having me meet your mother would be so traumatizing for you , ”
66370	66381	66382	66382	she	58	“ You asked my mother for permission to marry me , ”
66385	66389	66390	66390	She	58	“ I did . ”
66406	66418	66390	66390	She	58	“ What would you have done if she ’d said no ? ”
66423	66439	66419	66419	I	1777	“ Become one of those panhandlers on the boulevard you said I reminded you of . ”
66440	66447	66390	66390	She	58	“ We would n’t get married ? ”
66481	66507	66508	66508	I	1777	“ I would ’ve paid for your mother ’s surgery , and then I would ’ve found a nice , comfortable bridge to live under . ”
66533	66536	66530	66530	she	58	“ Why ? ”
66573	66585	66570	66570	I	1777	“ No one should have to die because they ’re broke . ”
66654	66659	66660	66660	Madonna	207	“ Like A Virgin . ”
66663	66669	66660	66660	Madonna	207	“ Feels so good inside . ”
66676	66679	66680	66680	Bianca	58	“ Wait . ”
66688	66696	66680	66680	Bianca	58	“ We ’re going the wrong way . ”
66697	66705	66660	66660	Madonna	207	“ No . We ’re going home . ”
66706	66712	66680	66680	Bianca	58	“ But my home is — ”
66713	66721	66722	66722	I	1777	“ We ’re going to our home , ”
66725	66768	66722	66722	I	1777	“ I want you to pick out your room before we leave this weekend . We need to get you settled . And I do n’t want to have to lie to my parents when they ask if we ’re living together . ”
66795	66803	66804	66804	I	1777	“ You ’re terrible for my ego , ”
66808	66823	66804	66804	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry . This is all just so . . . surreal . ”
67033	67037	67038	67038	I	1777	“ I know , ”
67041	67046	67038	67038	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry . ”
67061	67093	67094	67094	She	847	“ You have nothing to apologize for . It ’s me who ’s acting silly . You were right , this is a business deal that we ’re both benefiting from . ”
67101	67108	67094	67094	She	847	“ I ’m grateful to you . ”
67180	67184	67185	67185	he	1721	“ Miss Bianca ! ”
67202	67210	67193	67193	He	1721	“ So good to see you again ! ”
67229	67232	67233	67233	She	1172	“ Rayford . ”
67262	67268	67269	67269	he	1721	“ Why , Miss Bianca , ”
67278	67287	67269	67269	he	1721	“ You ’ll make an old man blush . ”
67357	67371	67373	67373	Rayford	1721	“ So tell me how it went with your mama and Mr. Boudreaux , ”
67405	67410	67411	67411	Bianca	58	“ It went great , ”
67419	67425	67411	67411	Bianca	58	“ She really liked him . ”
67463	67478	67453	67453	He	1721	“ Of course she did . What ’s not to like about Mr. Frownypants ? ”
67497	67504	67505	67505	I	1777	“ Let ’s take the elevator , ”
67523	67526	67519	67519	Bianca	58	“ Elevator ? ”
67527	67538	67540	67540	Rayford	1721	“ The master of the house enjoys installing unnecessary technology , ”
67556	67578	67551	67551	He	1721	“ But now that you ’ll be staying here , maybe you can talk him into finding a more useful hobby . ”
67579	67585	67586	67586	I	1777	“ Disposing of dead bodies , ”
67592	67597	67598	67598	Rayford	1721	“ Here we are ! ”
67677	67687	67674	67674	he	1721	“ I ’ll leave you two rabbits to it ! ”
67691	67693	67688	67688	He	1721	“ Call ”
67733	67736	67729	67729	Bianca	58	“ Rabbits ? ”
67740	67753	67737	67737	I	1777	“ I ’d fire him , but he ’s my only friend . ”
67754	67762	67763	67763	she	58	“ I ’m your friend , too , ”
67845	67854	67841	67841	Bianca	58	“ Was that the wrong thing to say ? ”
67855	67867	67841	67841	Bianca	58	“ No . Of course not . Why do you ask ? ”
67868	67884	67841	67841	Bianca	58	“ Because when you get really aggravated , you stab your hands through your hair . ”
67885	67889	67841	67841	Bianca	58	“ I do ? ”
67893	67922	67890	67890	She	58	“ And you bristle . You literally get larger somehow . It ’s freakish . Also you make some very unnerving animal sounds and have serial killer eyes . ”
67923	67928	67929	67929	I	1777	“ What a charmer , ”
67934	67941	67942	67942	she	58	“ It ’s not all bad , ”
67972	67976	67966	67966	I	1777	“ Do tell . ”
67977	68019	67942	67942	she	58	“ Well . Um . You smell amazing . After you stopped murdering me with your eyes and I got past all the hair and your generally disheveled , hobolike appearance , it was the first thing I noticed about you . ”
68053	68086	68046	68046	My	1777	“ And you have a really beautiful voice . If you ever decided not to be a layabout rich person , you could have an incredible career as a phone sex operator . ”
68118	68121	68115	68115	I	1777	“ Layabout ? ”
68135	68152	68132	68132	She	58	“ You ’re right . That was rude . What ’s an inoffensive word for idle ? ”
68193	68215	68177	68177	I	1777	“ Maybe you could tell me a few more things you like about me to make up for your horrible manners . ”
68266	68274	68263	68263	She	58	“ You ’ll get a big head . ”
68282	68292	68263	68263	She	58	“ There ’s just so many things , eh ? ”
68306	68328	68297	68297	she	58	“ Actually I ran out of things already . I ’m just trying to buy time to make up something else . ”
68381	68384	68385	68385	he	43	“ Lady ! ”
68445	68458	68476	68476	her	58	“ Oh ! You ’ve got him , sir , thank goodness ! ”
68494	68499	68500	68500	I	1777	“ Morning , Charlie . ”
68518	68526	68512	68512	he	43	“ Is he wearing you out already ? ”
68536	68584	68527	68527	She	58	“ I do n’t know where he gets his energy , sir . I swear it ’s like Sunkist puts cocaine in their orange juice . Every day after breakfast he just starts bouncing off the walls and does n’t stop until he falls asleep at night . ”
68667	68682	68664	68664	I	1777	“ What do you think about having Charlie read you a book , buddy ? ”
68703	68709	68698	68698	he	43	“ Book buddy book buddy ! ”
68738	68744	68732	68732	I	1777	“ Love you , buddy . ”
68769	68776	68766	68766	He	43	“ Cody loves Daddy , too . ”
68783	68812	68766	68766	He	43	“ Now I have to talk to Bianca for a while , but I ’ll come and read with you and Charlie when we ’re done , okay ? ”
68868	68877	68879	68879	Charlie	1721	“ Nice to see you again , Bianca , ”
68892	68905	68884	68884	I	1777	“ Buddy , can you say hello to Bianca without tackling her ? ”
68927	68930	68924	68924	He	43	“ Lady ! ”
68938	68943	68934	68934	Bianca	58	“ Hello , Cody . ”
68944	68950	68934	68934	Bianca	58	“ Book buddy book buddy ! ”
68956	68964	68951	68951	Bianca	58	“ Do you have a favorite book ? ”
68977	68985	68987	68987	Charlie	1721	“ That means he likes them all , ”
69044	69052	69034	69034	She	58	“ Ready to go read , Cody ? ”
69069	69084	69085	69085	Charlie	1721	“ Okay , then . I ’ll see you later , sir . Bianca . ”
69109	69117	69119	69119	Bianca	58	“ You ’re very good with him , ”
69139	69170	69134	69134	she	58	“ He wo n’t be a bother to you , if that ’s what you ’re thinking . Charlie keeps him busy , and he ’ll start preschool next year — ”
69171	69184	69185	69185	Bianca	58	“ Jackson ! That ’s not what I was thinking at all ! ”
69189	69218	69185	69185	Bianca	58	“ I just meant that you ’re very . . . good with him . A natural . You seem like you were born to be a father . ”
69337	69341	69342	69342	I	1777	“ Thank you , ”
69368	69373	69361	69361	I	1777	“ Are you angry ? ”
69378	69392	69374	69374	She	58	“ I ’m not the kind of woman who ’s bothered by children . ”
69404	69416	69393	69393	My	1777	“ Of course you ’re not . I did n’t mean — ”
69417	69423	69424	69424	she	58	“ Yes , you did , ”
69431	69440	69424	69424	she	58	“ or you would n’t have said it . ”
69477	69490	69473	69473	I	1777	“ Whatever I ’ve said to offend you , I ’m sorry . ”
69513	69525	69504	69504	she	58	“ Forget it . Let ’s just get on with this . ”
69588	69593	69594	69594	I	1777	“ What is it ? ”
69628	69636	69620	69620	her	58	“ Ignore me . I ’m premenstrual . ”
69650	69653	69654	69654	I	1777	“ Bianca , ”
69661	69667	69654	69654	I	1777	“ What . Is it ? ”
69682	69733	69734	69734	She	58	“ I ’m not the girl you need to think the worst of , Jax . I ’m not the girl whose motives you need to suspect . You said you would n’t lie to me , and I believed you , so I ’ll extend you the same courtesy . ”
69742	69839	69734	69734	She	58	“ When you say something thoughtless , my feelings are going to get hurt . That child is the sweetest little boy I ’ve ever met . He wo n’t be a bother . He wo n’t be a burden . I do n’t know how much interaction you ’d like me to have with him , but I would very much like to become his friend , and for you to insinuate that I ’m that heartless that I ’d be put out by living in the same house as him , well . . . ”
69851	69862	69840	69840	She	58	“ That really makes me want to smack you again . ”
69882	69892	69878	69878	My	1777	“ I ’m an idiot . Please forgive me . ”
69948	69976	69977	69977	Jackson	487	“ If you need to change the temperature , close the drapes , or turn the lights on and off , everything is operated from this screen . ”
69993	70016	69977	69977	Jackson	487	“ And if you ’re not near the door , you can just speak your command aloud and Alexa will execute it . ”
70017	70022	70023	70023	I	1777	“ Who ’s Alexa ? ”
70051	70087	70038	70038	He	1777	“ It ’s a voice assistant . It can also read your audiobooks , check the weather , and let you buy things online just by using your voice . The whole house is wired . ”
70107	70114	70098	70098	I	1777	“ Will it watch me sleep ? ”
70118	70144	70115	70115	Jackson	487	“ No . But there is a video option on the touch pad so you can FaceTime with anyone in any room in the house . ”
70154	70171	70150	70150	he	1777	“ You have to accept the incoming call before the video feed activates . No spying . ”
70177	70182	70172	70172	I	1777	“ Of course not , ”
70253	70267	70268	70268	he	1777	“ We can change out any of this stuff you do n’t like , ”
70277	70280	70268	70268	he	1777	“ What ? ”
70281	70286	70287	70287	I	1777	“ Everything ’s perfect , ”
70290	70308	70287	70287	I	1777	“ This makes the bedroom at my house look like a homeless shelter . I love it . ”
70363	70366	70368	70368	Jackson	487	“ Good , ”
70388	70399	70400	70400	I	1777	“ I do have a lot of books , though , ”
70416	70437	70400	70400	I	1777	“ Bring them . I want you to be comfortable here . Bring anything that makes you feel at home . ”
70455	70462	70451	70451	I	1777	“ So . What ’s next ? ”
70497	70505	70494	70494	he	1777	“ Packing . Moving in . Kentucky . ”
70520	70526	70506	70506	He	1777	“ We fly out tomorrow . ”
70547	70559	70539	70539	I	1777	“ Oh . But I do n’t have a ticket yet — ”
70560	70569	70570	70570	His	1777	“ My father ’s sending his private jet . ”
70596	70606	70577	70577	I	1777	“ I see . What time are we leaving ? ”
70607	70611	70539	70539	I	1777	“ Five o’clock . ”
70642	70649	70630	70630	My	1777	“ When will we get back ? ”
70650	70654	70677	70677	Jackson	487	“ Sunday night . ”
70655	70658	70659	70659	I	1777	“ Okay , ”
70680	70740	70677	70677	Jackson	487	“ I ’ve hired a home health - care firm for your mother . They ’re going to send someone to her house tomorrow to help out while you ’re gone for the weekend . If you like the girl , you can keep her on indefinitely , but you can also interview other candidates next week . . . ”
70749	70754	70741	70741	He	1777	“ Was that wrong ? ”
70764	70797	70755	70755	I	1777	“ No . That ’s wonderful . Thank you . I asked Eeny if she could check in on Mama while I was gone , but this is . . . better . ”
70828	70837	70824	70824	Jackson	487	“ Would you like a moment to yourself ? ”
70857	70882	70847	70847	I	1777	“ No . I ’ve brought the contract . I suppose we should sign it now . And a bourbon would n’t go unappreciated . ”
70887	70894	70883	70883	Jackson	487	“ It ’s not even noon . ”
70895	70913	70883	70883	Jackson	487	“ It ’s five o’clock somewhere . And you know how I love your family ’s bourbon . ”
70924	70933	70934	70934	he	1777	“ Since you ’re marrying into the family , ”
70945	70950	70934	70934	he	1777	“ bourbon it is . ”
70993	71001	71003	71003	Jackson	487	“ To five years of wedded bliss , ”
71006	71016	71017	71017	I	1777	“ To not killing each other in our sleep , ”
71046	71057	71029	71029	Jackson	487	“ You ’re a true romantic , you know that ? ”
71058	71077	71078	71078	Jackson	487	“ To the marrow of my bones . What kind of clothes should I bring for this weekend ? ”
71081	71089	71078	71078	Jackson	487	“ Ones that cover your lady bits ? ”
71090	71118	71029	71029	Jackson	487	“ Ha . I need to know if I ’m expected to go horseback riding or ballroom dancing or whatever it is rich people do on weekends . ”
71126	71141	71119	71119	His	1777	“ I see . And you have jodhpurs and ball gowns in your wardrobe ? ”
71146	71156	71142	71142	I	1777	“ Oh , tons . Does n’t every girl ? ”
71174	71205	71162	71162	He	1777	“ Naturally . But do n’t worry about what clothes to bring . I ’m taking care of it . Just pack a small bag with your toiletries and underwear . ”
71218	71233	71206	71206	I	1777	“ I have no idea what that means , but it sounds vaguely worrisome . ”
71276	71284	71273	71273	He	1777	“ Do n’t trust me , hmm ? ”
71306	71315	71316	71316	I	1777	“ Well , you do have a reputation . ”
71389	71392	71393	71393	he	1777	“ Yes , ”
71397	71402	71393	71393	he	1777	“ I certainly do . ”
71414	71430	71403	71403	I	1777	“ Why do I get the impression I just stuck my foot in my mouth ? ”
71460	71492	71457	71457	He	1777	“ If you think my reputation is bad here , Bianca , wait until we get to Kentucky . Then maybe you ’ll understand why I never wanted to go back . ”
71524	71540	71518	71518	he	1777	“ Take Bianca home . I have some things I need to take care of . ”
71563	71587	71560	71560	I	1777	“ Just give it to me straight . It ’s schizophrenia , is n’t it ? I ’ve agreed to marry a schizophrenic . ”
71588	71597	71599	71599	Rayford	1721	“ At least you wo n’t be bored , ”
71604	71611	71599	71599	Rayford	1721	“ Crazy people are awful fun . ”
72127	72131	72132	72132	he	1721	“ Miss Bianca , ”
72148	72155	72141	72141	He	1721	“ You ready to visit Kentucky ? ”
72164	72172	72156	72156	I	1777	“ Ready as I ’ll ever be ! ”
72238	72255	72233	72233	His	1721	“ We have to stop by my attorney ’s office on the way to the airport . ”
72256	72264	72265	72265	He	1721	“ Good morning to you , too . ”
72324	72328	72329	72329	he	1721	“ Mr. Boudreaux , ”
72401	72407	72370	72370	He	267	“ Sign here , please . ”
72424	72429	72430	72430	I	1777	“ What ’s this ? ”
72436	72444	72445	72445	he	267	“ The trust has to be notarized , ”
72454	72457	72458	72458	I	1777	“ Oh . ”
72637	72642	72634	72634	He	267	“ You look beautiful . ”
72646	72651	72643	72643	I	1777	“ I ’m terrified . ”
72652	72656	72643	72643	I	1777	“ Of what ? ”
72657	72665	72643	72643	I	1777	“ What if your parents hate me ? ”
72666	72673	72643	72643	I	1777	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
72674	72683	72643	72643	I	1777	“ Of course I ’m worried about it ! ”
72690	72703	72704	72704	he	267	“ No matter what happens , you ’re going to be fine , ”
72791	72794	72788	72788	we	1250	“ security , ”
72861	72898	72856	72856	I	1777	“ Is this leather made from a special kind of cow who got daily massages and deep conditioning for his coat and ate a diet of macrobiotic lettuces while being read poetry by beautiful young women ? ”
72913	72928	72910	72910	Jackson	487	“ I do n’t know , but I ’d like to be that cow . ”
72929	72942	72910	72910	Jackson	487	“ Me , too . I ’ve never felt leather like this . ”
72943	72952	72910	72910	Jackson	487	“ Wait until you go to the bathroom . ”
72956	72967	72953	72953	I	1777	“ Is the toilet seat leather ? That sounds unhygienic . ”
72968	73022	72910	72910	Jackson	487	“ No , the toilet seat is heated . It can also be cooled , if you prefer your ass chilled while you take care of business . Then afterward , you have your choice of oscillating or pulsing spray wash , followed by a lovely air dry . It ’s very civilized . ”
73045	73055	73023	73023	I	1777	“ So how long is this flight , anyway ? ”
73056	73067	73090	73090	Jackson	487	“ Hour and forty - five , give or take . ”
73068	73086	73023	73023	I	1777	“ And are you going to spend it pretend sleeping , or are we going to talk ? ”
73132	73145	73186	73186	He	1721	“ Are you going to be like this after we ’re married ? ”
73146	73150	73151	73151	I	1777	“ Like what ? ”
73159	73185	73151	73151	I	1777	“ Charming and sociable ? No , you ’re right , I should be surly and taciturn ; it makes everything so much more fun . ”
73231	73263	73223	73223	I	1777	“ You ’re more prickly than a porcupine who wandered into barbed wire . Want to talk about it ? Get it off your chest before you see mumsy and daddy ? ”
73264	73267	73268	73268	he	1721	“ No , ”
73317	73326	73328	73328	Jackson	487	“ I already told you you look beautiful , ”
73336	73340	73328	73328	Jackson	487	“ Stop fussing . ”
73366	73375	73376	73376	I	1777	“ Yes , but do I look wifely ? ”
73441	73449	73435	73435	His	1721	“ I told you not to worry . ”
73453	73474	73475	73475	I	1777	“ Yes , you did . So helpful , by the way . So informative . Really settles my nerves . ”
73482	73500	73435	73435	His	1721	“ All right , Bianca , since you asked — no , you do n’t look wifely . ”
73516	73557	73513	73513	he	1721	“ I ’ve never seen anyone ’s wife who looks as good as you do . You ’re a fucking wet dream . Now stop fishing for compliments and buckle your lap belt , we ’re about to take off . ”
73721	73734	73708	73708	She	1258	“ May I get you something to eat or drink , sir ? ”
73792	73799	73779	73779	she	1258	“ Something for you , miss ? ”
73800	73805	73806	73806	I	1777	“ Water , please , ”
73835	73843	73845	73845	Jackson	487	“ What was that wistful sigh for ? ”
73869	73877	73866	73866	he	1262	“ Nice try . Answer the question . ”
73878	73892	73866	73866	he	1262	“ Why do I have to answer questions , and you do n’t ? ”
73901	73922	73866	73866	he	1262	“ Ugh . Fine . I was just thinking that woman looks exactly how I ’ve always wanted to look . ”
73929	73932	73923	73923	Jackson	487	“ What ? ”
73933	73954	73866	73866	he	1262	“ You know . All - American Malibu Barbie . Big boobs , blonde hair , lots of shiny teeth . ”
73964	73981	73955	73955	He	1262	“ Why the fuck would you want to look like that when you look like this ? ”
74003	74023	74000	74000	I	1777	“ Are you deliberately trying to butter me up so I ’ll feel more confident about meeting your parents ? ”
74046	74063	74024	74024	He	1262	“ No , Bianca . I am not . Trying . To butter you . Up . ”
74076	74079	74080	74080	I	1777	“ Well , ”
74085	74096	74080	74080	I	1777	“ Thank you . You ’re not half bad yourself . ”
74124	74127	74166	74166	Jackson	487	“ Oh ? ”
74128	74131	74132	74132	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
74149	74165	74140	74140	I	1777	“ I was just thinking the other day that you are n’t entirely unfortunate looking . ”
74183	74190	74191	74191	Her	554	“ Here you are , miss . ”
74197	74201	74191	74191	Her	554	“ Thank you . ”
74254	74259	74260	74260	he	1263	“ Before I forget , ”
74263	74270	74271	74271	He	1263	“ I have something for you . ”
74319	74334	74315	74315	He	1263	“ Remind me in the future that you do n’t react well to surprises . ”
74351	74356	74357	74357	I	1777	“ What ’s this ? ”
74368	74384	74360	74360	His	1263	“ Did you think I ’d let my fiancée walk around without an engagement ring ? ”
74402	74415	74385	74385	I	1777	“ But . . . you . . . we . . . ”
74416	74425	74360	74360	His	1263	“ Just open the damn box , Bianca . ”
74496	74554	74492	74492	Jackson	487	“ And I ’m quoting , ‘ A five - carat flawless Tiffany brilliant - cut center stone with a pair of flawless one - carat stones flanking it , set in a platinum band . ’ No woman is that specific about the ring she wants unless she ’s spent a lot of time researching it . ”
74563	74566	74555	74555	I	1777	“ Grglefarbluhh . ”
74676	74679	74680	74680	I	1777	“ Jax , ”
74683	74687	74680	74680	I	1777	“ Holy shit . ”
74711	74728	74688	74688	He	1263	“ God , that right there made it worth the price ! I made you curse ! ”
74729	74739	74740	74740	I	1777	“ Please do n’t talk to me about price . ”
74761	74796	74740	74740	I	1777	“ Sweet baby Jesus . I ’ll get mugged wearing this thing . Some robber will cut off my hand with a machete . I ca n’t cook without my left hand , Jax ! ”
74797	74802	74803	74803	he	1263	“ Ha ha ha ! ”
74811	74817	74818	74818	I	1777	“ Oh , I see , ”
74822	74846	74818	74818	I	1777	“ Now I ’ve discovered the secret . The way to make you happy is to freak out and swear like a sailor . ”
74871	74880	74881	74881	he	1263	“ You make me happy all the time , ”
74967	74978	74963	74963	I	1777	“ That ’s because I ’m so charming and sociable . ”
74999	75008	74963	74963	I	1777	“ And have such good taste in jewelry . ”
75025	75028	75029	75029	he	1263	“ Obviously , ”
75158	75161	75163	75163	Jackson	487	“ Shakespeare ? ”
75184	75197	75181	75181	I	1777	“ Much Ado About Nothing . Someone recently recommended it to me . ”
75388	75393	75385	75385	Jackson	487	“ Breathe , Bianca . ”
75490	75497	75487	75487	He	1777	“ It ’s the guest house . ”
75498	75501	75520	75520	He	1777	“ Oh . ”
75523	75531	75520	75520	He	1777	“ There are seventeen on the property . ”
75544	75552	75537	75537	I	1777	“ Seventeen guest houses . Like that ? ”
75553	75562	75587	75587	He	1777	“ No . That ’s the small one . ”
75590	75709	75587	75587	He	1777	“ The estate comprises two hundred sixty acres , five lakes , seventeen guest cottages , botanical gardens , a deer park , a stable yard and coach house , and its own church . The main residence has thirty - seven bedrooms — by some counts it ’s thirty - nine , no one ’s really sure — thirty - two bathrooms , an entire wing dedicated to servants ’ quarters , a bowling alley , basketball and tennis courts , a fifty - seat theatre , a replica of an English pub , a thirty - thousand - bottle wine cellar , and a full arcade . And a bunch of other shit I ’m forgetting . ”
75715	75718	75710	75710	We	1286	“ cottages , ”
75760	75766	75757	75757	Jackson	487	“ Welcome to Moonstar Ranch . ”
75965	75968	75969	75969	I	1777	“ Okay , ”
75976	76080	75969	75969	I	1777	“ I ’ve respected your privacy . I have n’t pried into what happened that made you leave this place and never come back , but now you have to give me something . You ca n’t let me walk in there blind . Just give it to me straight — murder ? Kidnapping ? Sexual abuse ? I swear I wo n’t judge or repeat a word to another living soul . Just tell me why you would ever want to leave somewhere so beautiful . And also why it ’s called a ranch because that is like its own European country . ”
76094	76104	76090	76090	He	1777	“ Even the most beautiful things can be toxic . ”
76108	76117	76090	76090	He	1777	“ That is n’t helpful . At all . ”
76131	76164	76118	76118	He	1777	“ You ’ll be happy to know that it ’s nothing as dramatic as what your imagination is conjuring . You ever think about giving up the chef gig and writing fiction ? ”
76184	76197	76180	76180	I	1777	“ So no sexual abuse ? No bodies buried in the garden ? ”
76201	76209	76198	76198	He	1777	“ For Christ ’s sake , Bianca ! ”
76210	76218	76198	76198	He	1777	“ What am I supposed to think ? ”
76219	76239	76198	76198	He	1777	“ Really ? In a void of details , you go straight to murder and getting diddled by Daddy ? ”
76240	76249	76198	76198	He	1777	“ Well it had to be something major ! ”
76255	76280	76250	76250	He	1777	“ It was . And no , it did n’t involve murder , kidnapping , or inappropriate fondling on the part of my parents . ”
76290	76297	76287	76287	he	1777	“ Or anyone else , either ! ”
76310	76323	76305	76305	I	1777	“ Does it have to do with the man - eating shark ? ”
76363	76378	76360	76360	Jackson	487	“ Enough questions . Let ’s just get through this weekend , all right ? ”
76522	76530	76531	76531	His	1777	“ Hey . Boudreaux . Down here . ”
76551	76603	76547	76547	I	1777	“ I ’m your friend . Do n’t forget that . No matter what you ’re dragging me into here , what psychotic ex - girlfriends or crazy relatives or dead bodies rotting under the rosebushes that you ’re not admitting to , I ’m on your side . Got it ? ”
76710	76716	76717	76717	I	1777	“ All right , then , ”
76724	76742	76717	76717	I	1777	“ Now pretend like you ’re madly in love with me and introduce me to your parents . ”
76861	76866	76858	76858	I	1777	“ What a dump . ”
76897	76904	76905	76905	he	1982	“ To your rooms , sir ? ”
76922	76928	76929	76929	I	1777	“ You know that guy ? ”
76934	76953	76912	76913	the driver	1982	“ He ’s been on staff since I was . . . ten , I think . Charles . ”
76954	76977	76912	76913	the driver	1982	“ I thought he was a driver from a service . The two of you acted like you ’d never met before ! ”
76986	77004	76978	76978	Jackson	487	“ Did you expect he ’d throw his arms around me and give me a big hug ? ”
77005	77031	77055	77056	Oh boy	575	“ But there was n’t even a ‘ nice to see you . ’ There was n’t even a hint he recognized you at all . ”
77043	77054	77032	77032	Jackson	487	“ Rayford was the only one who ever liked me . ”
77080	77089	77074	77074	I	1777	“ So where ’s the lineup of servants ? ”
77097	77105	77106	77106	I	1777	“ Just kidding . But . . . ”
77113	77126	77106	77106	I	1777	“ Um . Should n’t there be someone here to meet us ? ”
77184	77194	77174	77174	Jackson	487	“ Zeus ! Apollo ! Come here , boys ! ”
77252	77259	77261	77261	Jackson	487	“ Do n’t worry , Bianca , ”
77268	77277	77261	77261	Jackson	487	“ wolfhounds are n’t usually aggressive to strangers . ”
77278	77292	77342	77342	me	1777	“ Usually does n’t give me the greatest feeling of confidence , Jax . ”
77293	77298	77299	77299	He	1777	“ They ’re sweethearts . ”
77328	77339	77325	77325	He	1777	“ Hold out your hand and let them sniff you . ”
77388	77392	77393	77393	I	1777	“ Nice doggies , ”
77398	77402	77393	77393	I	1777	“ Good doggies . ”
77425	77430	77441	77441	Jackson	487	“ You ’re early , ”
77502	77505	77507	77507	Jackson	487	“ Father , ”
77562	77569	77570	77570	he	1753	“ And you must be Bianca , ”
77584	77593	77570	77570	he	1753	“ I ’ve heard so much about you . ”
77648	77660	77620	77620	I	1777	“ Mr. Boudreaux . I ’m so happy to meet you . ”
77744	77773	77741	77741	He	1753	“ Oh . Dear . You ’ll have to excuse me , Bianca , I do n’t think I ’ve been hugged by anyone in about fifty years . ”
77793	77837	77787	77787	I	1777	“ Sorry to be so forward , but we ’re big huggers in my family , Mr. Boudreaux . My mama always told me there are few things a good hug ca n’t cure , and those things are what bourbon ’s for . ”
77855	77885	77848	77848	his	1753	“ Call me Brig , Bianca . If you ’re gon na be family , we should be on a first - name basis , do n’t you think ? ”
77916	77929	77913	77913	I	1777	“ Thank you , Brig . That ’s awfully nice of you . ”
77941	77966	77930	77930	Brig	112	“ Well . You must be tired after your journey . I ’ll let you freshen up before dinner . It ’s at eight . ”
77999	78013	77996	77996	I	1777	“ Whew ! I think that went pretty well , do n’t you ? ”
78028	78031	78032	78032	I	1777	“ What ? ”
78053	78059	78060	78060	he	43	“ You hugged my father , ”
78068	78082	78060	78060	he	43	“ I ca n’t decide if you ’re a genius or totally insane . ”
78088	78098	78083	78083	I	1777	“ That ’s easy . I ’m a genius . ”
78099	78102	78103	78103	he	43	“ Yes , ”
78106	78114	78103	78103	he	43	“ I ’m beginning to think so . ”
78141	78143	78122	78122	he	43	“ house ”
78183	78196	78197	78197	I	1777	“ I can see why you ’d hate it so much here , ”
78203	78214	78197	78197	I	1777	“ This is really beyond the limits of human tolerance . ”
78448	78454	78455	78455	Jackson	487	“ You ’re thinking again . ”
78473	78477	78464	78464	He	43	“ Stop it . ”
78478	78489	78455	78455	Jackson	487	“ Is this . . . are we . . . ”
78501	78508	78494	78494	I	1777	“ Where will I be sleeping ? ”
78567	78570	78571	78571	he	43	“ Here , ”
78583	78593	78571	78571	he	43	“ You mean . . . on that bed ? ”
78604	78613	78597	78597	My	1777	“ As in . . . with you ? ”
78635	78648	78649	78649	he	43	“ I ’ll take the sofa , you can have the bed , ”
78762	78769	78755	78755	I	1777	“ Tell me about your mother . ”
78775	78785	78786	78786	he	43	“ Christ , you ’re like a honey badger , ”
78797	78816	78789	78789	I	1777	“ I do n’t know what that is , but it sounds extremely cute , so thank you . ”
78826	78839	78817	78817	His	43	“ It ’s like a large , ferocious weasel with impenetrable skin . ”
78850	78870	78844	78844	I	1777	“ Just give me a little something to prepare for . I assume I ’ll meet her at dinner ? ”
78880	78891	78817	78817	His	43	“ Yes . Unless she decides not to come down . ”
78896	78905	78910	78910	He	43	“ Are you on speaking terms with her ? ”
78920	78931	78910	78910	He	43	“ I have n’t spoken to her since I left . ”
79019	79028	79015	79015	Jackson	487	“ What are you looking at , Bianca ? ”
79073	79076	79053	79053	I	1777	“ Nothing . ”
79077	79092	79097	79097	he	43	“ Then why is your face the color of that chair in the corner ? ”
79105	79113	79114	79114	I	1777	“ Now who ’s the honey badger ? ”
79171	79178	79168	79168	he	43	“ Were you looking at this ? ”
79182	79188	79179	79179	I	1777	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
79221	79224	79197	79197	He	43	“ This ? ”
79383	79389	79391	79403	a uniformed male servant with a bland face and droopy hound dog eyes	1347	“ Excuse me , sir , ”
79408	79418	79405	79405	He	1347	“ Madam . Do you need anything before supper ? ”
79430	79448	79419	79419	Jackson	487	“ No . And in the future your presence is n’t required unless I ring for you . ”
79454	79460	79461	79461	He	1347	“ Very good , sir . ”
79481	79497	79478	79478	I	1777	“ I ’ll just be hiding in the bathroom until dinner if you need me , ”
79647	79652	79653	79653	I	1777	“ You fucking moron , ”
79671	79678	79653	79653	I	1777	“ You complete , colossal fuckwit . ”
79979	80022	79976	79976	I	1777	“ If you want to hit me with something , there ’s a very heavy bronze reproduction of the obelisk in Saint Peter ’s Square on the credenza . I can bring it to you . It has a conveniently pointy tip . ”
80031	80040	80023	80023	Her	58	“ I do n’t want to hit you . ”
80097	80109	80078	80078	She	58	“ Maybe we could just . . . forget that happened . ”
80121	80125	80117	80117	she	58	“ For now . ”
80238	80245	80246	80246	she	58	“ You mentioned something about clothes , ”
80252	80263	80293	80293	I	1777	“ Is the dress I ’m wearing appropriate for dinner ? ”
80264	80287	80293	80293	I	1777	“ Yes . But there are things in the closet you can look through if you ’d like to wear something else . ”
80296	80307	80293	80293	I	1777	“ I had a few things brought in for you . ”
80315	80321	80308	80308	She	58	“ You shopped for me ? ”
80345	80353	80322	80322	I	1777	“ How did you know my size ? ”
80381	80385	80377	80377	I	1777	“ I guessed . ”
80390	80422	80386	80386	Her	58	“ Please tell me you did n’t guess I ’m a size two , because if you did , I ’ll be wearing this dress for the rest of the weekend . ”
80522	80534	80518	80518	her	58	“ There are a lot of clothes in there , Jax . ”
80535	80560	80494	80494	she	58	“ They do n’t belong to someone else , if that ’s what you ’re thinking . I just wanted you to have choices . ”
80593	80636	80637	80637	I	1777	“ You do n’t have to wear anything you do n’t like , of course . But anything you do like we ’ll take home . . . I mean , assuming you want to . Or we can leave it all , ”
80646	80653	80654	80654	she	58	“ This is all for me ? ”
80657	80660	80661	80661	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
80715	80719	80720	80720	she	58	“ Thank you , ”
80783	80788	80780	80780	I	1777	“ You ’re welcome . ”
80852	80858	80849	80849	she	58	“ You ’re very tall . ”
80862	80870	80849	80849	she	58	“ I ’ll buy you platform boots . ”
80927	80937	80924	80924	She	58	“ I see someone in the family enjoys hugs . ”
80974	80978	80971	80971	I	1777	“ Lucky me . ”
81054	81062	81063	81063	she	58	“ What are you thinking right now ? ”
81072	81080	81067	81067	I	1777	“ You do n’t want to know . ”
81081	81089	81093	81093	she	58	“ It ’s that dirty , huh ? ”
81118	81121	81115	81115	I	1777	“ Filthy . ”
81171	81175	81168	81168	she	58	“ Two years . ”
81222	81248	81206	81206	She	58	“ You asked me how long it had been since the last time . . . I had sex . The answer is two years . ”
81373	81378	81379	81379	I	1777	“ That ’s nothing , ”
81386	81396	81379	81379	I	1777	“ I ’ve got you beat by a mile . ”
81439	81477	81423	81423	She	58	“ Why do n’t you pick out what you ’d like me to wear for dinner . Let ’s see what kind of taste you ’ve got , Boudreaux . I ’m going to fix my hair . ”
81918	81925	81926	81926	I	1777	“ Keep it together , Bianca , ”
82011	82015	82016	82016	I	1777	“ Hair down . ”
82049	82056	82057	82057	I	1777	“ Oh . Um . Okay . ”
82088	82094	82095	82095	I	1777	“ Are you wearing that ? ”
82103	82106	82107	82107	He	1777	“ Yes . ”
82158	82218	82220	82220	he	1777	“ Okay , I ’m saying this only to be helpful , not judgy , but I think your old leather jacket and jeans might not be the most appropriate thing to wear to dinner with the parents you have n’t seen in years . Who live in a castle . And probably dine on solid - gold plates . ”
82228	82252	82225	82225	I	1777	“ Also you clash with my outfit . Which I love , by the way . It ’s beautiful . So . . . ”
82292	82299	82289	82289	He	1777	“ Sure , I ’ll change . ”
82593	82606	82607	82607	I	1777	“ So this is what you do with all your free time , ”
82618	82622	82607	82607	I	1777	“ Work out . ”
82633	82655	82629	82629	Jackson	487	“ Would you like to pick out my clothes for me ? Since you ’re in the mood to be helpful ? ”
82679	82687	82688	82688	I	1777	“ I ’m sure you can manage . ”
82846	82855	82856	82856	Jackson	487	“ What was that great big sigh for ? ”
82870	82876	82877	82877	I	1777	“ Just a little gas , ”
82957	82960	82961	82961	I	1777	“ Better , ”
82971	82975	82961	82961	I	1777	“ Now tuck . ”
82976	82984	82985	82985	he	1365	“ You sound like a wife already , ”
83129	83138	83117	83118	Dear Lord	1374	“ Everything all right in there , Bianca ? ”
83171	83175	83158	83158	I	1777	“ Peachy keen . ”
83215	83218	83219	83219	he	1365	“ Ready ? ”
83226	83230	83231	83231	I	1777	“ For dinner , ”
83234	83246	83219	83219	he	1365	“ Of course . What else would I be talking about ? ”
83479	83482	83484	83488	the droopy - eyed manservant	1721	“ Madam , ”
83507	83510	83511	83511	he	1721	“ Aperitif ? ”
83518	83521	83525	83525	he	1721	“ Yes ! ”
83598	83601	83617	83618	The manservant	1721	“ Sir ? ”
83637	83646	83632	83632	I	1777	“ What the unholy Christmas miracle is this ? ”
83647	83657	83658	83658	he	1721	“ My parents like to keep a full staff , ”
83674	83690	83666	83666	I	1777	“ I bet they ’re single - handedly propping up the state ’s unemployment rate . ”
83691	83694	83658	83658	he	1721	“ Bianca ! ”
83745	83757	83772	83772	he	1384	“ Oh ! Hello , Mr. Boudreaux . I mean Brig . ”
83780	83787	83772	83772	he	1384	“ You look wonderful . Wonderful ! ”
83853	83857	83858	83858	I	1777	“ Thank you . ”
83883	83886	83864	83864	He	1384	“ Jackson . ”
83887	83890	83864	83864	He	1384	“ Brig . ”
83933	83945	83929	83929	Brig	112	“ Thank you for changing out of that dreadful leather jacket . ”
83950	83957	83958	83958	he	1384	“ That was Christian ’s jacket , ”
84042	84054	84055	84055	I	1777	“ I made him put on a dress shirt for dinner , ”
84062	84082	84055	84055	I	1777	“ But I think that jacket looks great on him . Not everyone can pull off the vintage look . ”
84095	84098	84099	84099	He	112	“ Indeed . ”
84139	84152	84107	84107	Jackson	487	“ So . Bianca . Jackson tells me you ’re a chef ? ”
84153	84168	84126	84126	He	112	“ That ’s right . I recently opened my first restaurant in New Orleans . ”
84169	84184	84107	84107	Jackson	487	“ How marvelous . I understand your mother was also in the restaurant business ? ”
84205	84230	84194	84194	he	112	“ She had a spot in the Ninth Ward for about twenty years before Hurricane Katrina wiped it out . She retired after that . ”
84235	84250	84231	84231	Brig	112	“ I ’m sorry to hear that . She did n’t want to rebuild ? ”
84251	84261	84231	84231	Brig	112	“ We did n’t have the money to rebuild . ”
84274	84296	84268	84268	Brig	112	“ Well . It ’s wonderful that you ’re carrying on the family tradition . Your mother must be very proud . ”
84433	84479	84425	84425	I	1777	“ Oh , she is . But she ’d be proud of me even if I were unemployed and living on food stamps . She ’s not the kind of person who only loves her child unless she ’s following her own definition of success . ”
84518	84541	84514	84514	He	1392	“ Of course not . Parents always love their children , even when they make it hard for us to do so . ”
84738	84741	84743	84743	Brig	112	“ Ah ! ”
84745	84753	84754	84754	He	112	“ Clemmy , come and meet Bianca . ”
84854	84866	84867	84867	I	1777	“ Mrs. Boudreaux . I ’m so happy to meet you . ”
84913	84928	84909	84909	I	1777	“ Your home is so beautiful . Thank you so much for having me . ”
84978	84984	84975	84975	she	111	“ Thank you for coming . ”
85007	85050	85004	85004	I	1777	“ Your son has been giving me fits since the day I met him , but I know he must get his big heart from you and your husband . I ’m so looking forward to getting to know you both better . ”
85100	85106	85095	85095	she	1380	“ That ’s very kind . ”
85227	85232	85217	85217	He	1411	“ Let ’s eat ! ”
85356	85365	85366	85366	Brig	112	“ So you two met at your restaurant ? ”
85403	85431	85432	85432	I	1777	“ Yes , we did . Jackson came in to sample my spring menu , which was inspired by Boudreaux Bourbon . Did n’t he mention it ? ”
85439	85451	85432	85432	I	1777	“ All the recipes are made with your family ’s bourbon . ”
85467	85470	85471	85471	he	112	“ No , ”
85482	85491	85471	85471	he	112	“ No , he did n’t mention it . ”
85514	85536	85537	85537	Clemmy	111	“ It ’s true . In fact , he threatened to sue me for copyright infringement on the family ’s trademark . ”
85562	85570	85537	85537	Clemmy	111	“ Oh ! Are you all right ? ”
85599	85602	85603	85603	she	111	“ Sue ? ”
85624	85637	85619	85619	she	111	“ Oh yes . He ’s very protective of the Boudreaux brand . ”
85664	85697	85698	85698	I	1777	“ And then , uh , he hired me to cater the Wounded Warrior charity benefit he was hosting at his home when his chef quit at the last minute . . . ”
85737	85758	85729	85729	I	1777	“ Which turned out to be an incredibly successful event . You might have read about it in the papers ? ”
85774	85787	85764	85764	I	1777	“ He raised a few million dollars to help soldiers in need ? ”
85820	85836	85817	85817	he	908	“ Well that ’s . . . wonderful . That ’s really wonderful , son . ”
85898	85901	85902	85902	I	1777	“ Anyway , ”
85922	85935	85902	85902	I	1777	“ That ’s how it all began . Now here we are ! ”
85954	85959	85949	85949	I	1777	“ Slap , slap kiss ”
86139	86147	86136	86136	Brig	112	“ Bianca ? Are you all right ? ”
86182	86210	86148	86148	Jackson	487	“ Do n’t mind me . I suppose I ’m just homesick . A few hours away from New Orleans and I ’m all out of sorts . ”
86211	86227	86287	86287	Brig	112	“ Are you originally from New Orleans ? Your accent is a little . . . ”
86242	86286	86228	86228	He	112	“ I know . It ’s a mess . My mama ’s side of the family is Creole , but my daddy was from Alabama . I picked up so much of both their slang and twang my accent ’s all mixed up . ”
86291	86305	86287	86287	Brig	112	“ It sounds just fine to me . What does your father do ? ”
86364	86377	86396	86396	I	1777	“ He was an attorney . But he passed away years ago . ”
86382	86395	86378	86378	His	112	“ Oh dear . I ’m sorry to hear that , Bianca . ”
86399	86433	86396	86396	I	1777	“ It ’s all right . I miss him like crazy , but I have great memories of him . He was the kindest , most honorable and generous man I ever knew . ”
86443	86448	86439	86439	I	1777	“ Aside from Jackson . ”
86527	86531	86532	86532	he	227	“ More wine ? ”
86559	86565	86545	86545	He	227	“ Yes . Thank you . ”
86845	86855	86856	86856	I	1777	“ Not a word out of you , Boudreaux ! ”
86932	86950	86915	86915	he	1445	“ Mother . Father . Please excuse us . I think Bianca and I need to talk . ”
86951	86958	86959	86959	I	1777	“ You ’re darn tootin ’ ! ”
87017	87020	87011	87011	He	227	“ Oof ! ”
87031	87071	87021	87021	I	1777	“ Thank you for the wonderful meal and your hospitality . I ’m sorry if I ’m being rude , and you both seem like lovely people , but now I have to go jerk a knot in someone ’s tail”—I
87074	87098	87021	87021	I	1777	Jackson—“and depending on how that conversation goes , I may or may not require a bail bondsman . Have yourselves a wonderful evening . ”
87194	87212	87213	87213	I	1777	“ Do you have any idea how unfair it is , what you just did to me ? ”
87216	87275	87213	87213	I	1777	“ Leaving me totally clueless , acting like a gold star idiot in front of your parents ? This agreement is n’t only about your inheritance , Jackson , it ’s about my mother ’s situation , too ! We ’re supposed to be in this deal together ! Why are n’t you helping me out at all ? ”
87305	87315	87316	87316	He	1454	“ Because you ’re doing fine on your own . ”
87330	87373	87302	87302	he	1454	“ Are you blind ? Even the servants are laughing at me ! What ’s the big secret here ? What is it that you and everybody else knows that I do n’t ? Just tell me what on earth is going — ”
87374	87380	87381	87381	he	1454	“ I killed my brother , ”
87443	87459	87416	87416	Jackson	487	“ Or at least they all think I did . They blame me for it . ”
87474	87482	87471	87471	I	1777	“ Oh my God . What happened ? ”
87518	87535	87536	87536	he	1454	“ Lincoln and I were twins . He was older by two minutes . Two minutes , ”
87540	87560	87536	87536	he	1454	“ You would n’t think one hundred and twenty seconds could make such a difference , but it did . ”
87621	87682	87694	87694	he	1454	“ Linc was the golden child from the beginning . The heir and the spare , they jokingly called us , only it was n’t a joke . He could do no wrong . He was better than me at everything . Sports , school , girls . . . everything came easy for him . And I . . . ”
87697	87716	87694	87694	he	1454	“ I hated him for it . I hated my own brother . Which made me hate myself . ”
87764	87840	87841	87841	His	1454	“ He looked like an angel . Literally , like a Raphael painting of an angel . Blond hair and dimpled cheeks , this smile everyone went crazy for . I was the dark one . The problematic one . The one with a learning disability and a temper so unpredictable they had to put me on medication when I was barely a teenager . I just . . . never . . . fit . ”
87878	87902	87841	87841	His	1454	“ Linc was being groomed to take over the company . It was the logical choice , him being eldest and so nice . ”
87921	87976	87912	87912	His	1454	“ But the thing was , he was n’t so nice . He was like this perfect , shiny red apple that was riddled with worms and rot on the inside . Only no one could see it . No one could believe that something so pretty could be so corrupt . Except me . ”
88079	88152	88076	88076	He	1454	“ Linc used to tell me I was adopted , that I was abandoned by the side of the road by beggars and left to die because I was so ugly and stupid that not even my real parents wanted me . He said Brig and Clemmy were getting tax credits for taking care of a homeless runt . He said I should just kill myself and stop being such a burden . ”
88157	88191	88076	88076	He	1454	“ Such a useless , stupid burden . But whenever I complained to my parents , they ’d look at each other with sad eyes and sigh and talk about adjusting my meds . ”
88218	88337	88213	88213	He	1454	“ On our fifteenth birthday , our parents threw us a party . Linc got all the attention , of course , and by then I was used to staying out of the way , so I went to the pool house and hid . I guess Linc decided I was embarrassing the family by hiding , because he came to look for me . We argued . It got heated . He called me names , I called him names . He took a swing at me but missed . I stepped out of the way too quickly . He stumbled and fell , cracked his head against the cement coping , and rolled into the pool . ”
88382	88443	88375	88375	His	1461	“ I could n’t swim . I was terrified of the water because the one time I ’d tried to learn , Linc held me under when no one was looking and I almost drowned . So I could n’t help him , I could n’t get to him , I couldn’t — I did n’t know what to do . ”
88465	88533	88534	88534	I	1777	“ I ran to get my parents , but by the time they got there it was too late . They found him on the bottom of the pool . Later the doctors said he ’d been unconscious when he went in , there was the mark on his face where he ’d fallen , and they all thought . . . they thought I . . . ”
88549	88562	88563	88563	I	1777	“ They thought you hit him and pushed him in the pool , ”
88595	88719	88588	88588	He	1777	“ No one ever said that directly , of course . But they never looked at me the same . People started avoiding me . Dozens of kids and their parents were at the party , and from that time on I was shunned . The word got out . You ca n’t be alone with Jackson . Stay away from Jackson . He ’s capable of anything . Then my parents sent me away to boarding school . From there I went directly to college . Which is where I met Christian , by the way , the only real friend I ’ve ever had . By the time I came home from college , my parents and I were basically strangers . ”
88720	88725	88726	88726	I	1777	“ Oh , Jackson , ”
88733	88743	88726	88726	I	1777	“ I ’m so sorry . That ’s terrible . ”
88764	88769	88770	88770	he	1777	“ It gets better , ”
88856	88862	88853	88853	his	1777	“ Her name was Cricket . ”
88908	89054	89055	89055	His	1463	“ Cricket Montgomery . The most beautiful girl in Kentucky , by anyone ’s standards . We were in grade school together before I went away , so I ’d known her for years . Known of her , I should say . Like everyone else , she adored my brother but never paid much attention to me , but a few years after I came back I ran into her at the public library in Louisville . I used to go there all the time to read and escape all the accusing eyes in this house . One day she was browsing for a book in the aisle near the chair I always sat in , and she recognized me and came over and said hello , even though I was trying to hide behind my book . She was really nice to me . ”
89062	89067	89055	89055	His	1463	“ So fucking nice . ”
89082	89122	89068	89068	He	1463	“ I should ’ve known right then . But I was so starved for attention , for anyone to notice me or look at me like I was n’t a murdering freak , that I was completely fucking blind . ”
89154	89231	89068	89068	He	1463	“ We started dating . I could n’t believe my good luck . Here was this beautiful , popular girl , choosing me . I was so happy I was delirious . My parents were over the moon . My father started talking about having me take over the business . It was like a dream , everything I ever wanted falling into place . After a year , I proposed . And she said yes . ”
89245	89258	89239	89239	His	1465	“ That evil , scheming , lying , soulless bitch said yes . ”
89318	89425	89286	89286	He	1465	“ It took another year to plan the wedding . Six hundred people were invited , including the governor . It was a zoo . All my parents ’ friends and business associates , all her friends and family , politicians , leaders in the liquor industry , a bunch of other people I did n’t even know . We had it here at Moonstar Ranch , of course . Great location for a wedding . The church was too small for that many guests , so the event coordinator designed this whole fantasy fairy tale theme that ended up costing more than a million dollars . ”
89429	89452	89453	89453	He	1465	“ I found out later the coordinator was one of Cricket ’s college friends . Cricket got a cut of her fee . ”
89467	89482	89463	89463	He	1465	“ Because of course that ’s what it was about all along . Money . ”
89543	89647	89651	89651	his	1465	“ The ceremony was ready to start . The guests were seated . The violinists had begun to play . But the bride was nowhere to be found . The coordinator was having a nervous breakdown . So I went looking for Cricket . I thought she was probably just taking a minute to herself , nerves and all that . I had a hunch she ’d be in the stables because she loved to ride , so that ’s the first place I went . And I was right . . . she was there . And she was getting a ride . ”
89663	89668	89660	89660	I	1777	“ Oh , no ! ”
89681	89796	89669	89669	He	1465	“ Oh yes . Right there in the tack room , bent over the saddle stand with her thirty - thousand - dollar wedding dress that I paid for shoved up to her waist , her panties around her ankles . They did n’t see me come in . They just kept fucking and talking , him grunting , ‘ You ’re always gon na be mine , ’ and her crying that she was , that it was all for him , she was doing it for him , for their future , they only had to pretend for a little while longer . Everything became very clear to me . Very clear . ”
89802	89810	89797	89797	His	1467	“ And then I lost my mind . ”
89864	89988	89857	89857	his	1467	“ My hands were around his throat . She was screaming . Screaming at me to stop , I was killing him , but of course that ’s exactly what I intended to do . Kill him . One of her so - called ‘ friends ’ that we hung out with who smiled at me and clapped me on the back every time I paid for dinner . I wanted to kill him with my bare hands . And I would have , I ’m sure of it , but Cricket came at me with a big metal tool used to punch holes in leather and hit me in the face . She had to hit me three times before I let go .
89989	90057	90058	90058	He	1468	“ My blood was all over him . He was lying on the ground , bloody and unmoving , and she fell on him like Mary over the body of Jesus , weeping and wailing and begging him to say something . When he did n’t , she turned on me . You ’ve never seen anything so savage . And the things she said . God . ”
90069	90080	90081	90081	I	1777	“ Jackson , you do n’t have to tell me , ”
90090	90124	90125	90125	He	1468	“ I do . I have to tell someone , because I ’ve never told anyone else . Maybe if I get it out . . . maybe if I just . . . ”
90183	90259	90173	90173	he	1468	“ She never loved me . We did n’t meet in the library by accident . They ’d planned the whole thing . I was just a . . . meal ticket . A patsy . Who could love me , the murderer , the freak , the awful lover ? She fucked me for two years , and it was torture , she said . It was hell . She wished I was dead . ”
90320	90421	90317	90317	He	1468	“ I left . I did n’t say anything to anyone . I went to my room and packed a bag , and left Kentucky , right then . I could n’t bear to see their faces . I drove until I found myself in New Orleans . I checked into a hotel and hid there for a week , trying to drink myself to death . I did n’t have a gun and did n’t want to leave a bloody corpse for anyone else to clean up after anyway , so I thought alcohol poisoning was the way to go .
90422	90511	90563	90563	Jackson	487	“ It was Rayford who found me . Credit cards leave a trail . After Linc died he was the only one who would talk to me . Anyway , Cricket and her ‘ friend ’ told everyone they were just talking in the tack room when I came in and went crazy with jealousy . Did n’t matter , I had a death wish to take care of , who cared what story they made up ? But that old bastard Rayford would n’t leave me alone . ”
90520	90527	90516	90516	Jackson	487	“ Stubborn son of a bitch . ”
90528	90532	90533	90533	I	1777	“ Oh Jax , ”
90566	90609	90610	90610	He	1777	“ The day after the wedding that never was , my mother had a stroke . I did n’t know about it until later , but obviously it was my fault . The humiliation was too much for her . The disappointment . ”
90616	90639	90563	90563	Jackson	487	“ Who could blame her ? With a son like hers , it ’s a miracle she did n’t die from shame . ”
90683	90747	90680	90680	he	1777	“ A week after I got to New Orleans , Christian had his legs blown off by a roadside bomb in a hellhole halfway around the world . He was my real brother . The brother who accepted me for who I was . He was the only one who ever did , aside from Rayford . He was my only real friend . ”
90756	90760	90680	90680	he	1777	“ And you . ”
90793	90909	90790	90790	Jackson	487	“ Christian had no family , so he came to live with me . He was in so much pain all the time , as much physical pain as I was in emotional pain . He started to drink . He ’d go down to a bar on Bourbon Street and drink during the day , and I ’d go with him . . . nothing better to do , either of us . He met this girl . I knew . . . what she was , of course . . . I knew what she did . But at least it was honest . They both understood . Not like me . . . ”
90952	91027	90927	90927	He	1469	“ She got pregnant . Had a paternity test . It was Christian ’s . He died before Cody was born . Never got to meet his son . Trina signed over her parental rights to me and disappeared . I get a call every once in a while . . . bail money , rent money . . . everyone wanting money . . . all I was ever good for . . . ”
91628	91633	91634	91634	she	1475	“ Yes , Jax , ”
91776	91779	91780	91780	she	1475	“ Please , ”
91783	91793	91780	91780	she	1475	“ Oh , please do n’t stop . More . ”
91820	91830	91831	91831	I	1777	“ I need to be inside you , sweetheart , ”
91961	91966	91967	91967	I	1777	“ I ’m sorry , ”
92039	92042	92029	92029	she	58	“ Wait ! ”
92125	92144	92121	92121	She	58	“ So I had this idea yesterday . When you were prancing around showing off all your muscles . ”
92169	92183	92190	92190	She	58	“ That maybe it would be a good idea if we . . . ”
92208	92218	92200	92200	she	58	“ If we got it out of our systems . ”
92235	92238	92239	92239	I	1777	“ It ? ”
92268	92284	92263	92263	Her	58	“ Do n’t be intentionally obtuse , Jackson . You know exactly what I mean . ”
92366	92401	92358	92358	She	58	“ It does n’t have to change anything . One time just so we can get past it and put it behind us . And since neither of us has gotten any in forever — ”
92402	92413	92414	92414	I	1777	“ I wo n’t be able to have you once , ”
92506	92513	92499	92499	I	1777	“ Fuck . Fuck , Bianca ! ”
92550	92566	92547	92547	she	58	“ Yes . That ’s exactly what you should do , Jax . Fuck Bianca . ”
92739	92745	92746	92746	I	1777	“ You ’re killing me , ”
92749	92757	92758	92758	she	58	“ Why are you making me beg ? ”
92784	92792	92814	92814	Her	58	“ Why are you suddenly so horny ? ”
92821	92844	92814	92814	Her	58	“ Because you ’re beautiful , Jackson Boudreaux . Inside and out . I ’m an idiot for not realizing it sooner . ”
92926	92956	92922	92922	I	1777	“ I ca n’t . Not only once . I ca n’t risk it being weird after . I could n’t live with myself if I fucked this up . ”
92980	92989	92972	92972	she	58	“ So it ’s a negotiation , then . ”
92995	92999	92990	92990	My	1777	“ Excuse me ? ”
93000	93025	93026	93026	She	58	“ Well if you ca n’t do it only once , how many times do you think you would be able to do it ? ”
93052	93084	93033	93033	her	58	“ I . . . I ’m so out of practice . . . I think the first ten or twenty times might just be getting me back up to speed . ”
93085	93098	93099	93099	She	58	“ Ten or twenty ? Hmm . Ambitious , are n’t you ? ”
93122	93136	93115	93115	her	58	“ And would that all be in one day , or . . . ”
93137	93140	93141	93141	I	1777	“ No , ”
93166	93181	93158	93158	My	1777	“ No , I think I ’d need a lot more time than that . ”
93190	93205	93182	93182	I	1777	“ I mean , I do n’t want to wear you out or anything . ”
93206	93211	93212	93212	she	58	“ Such a gentleman , ”
93291	93327	93287	93287	She	58	“ Jackson . I ’m in your bed . I ’m wearing your ring . We ’re hot as two jalapeños for each other . Do me , dammit , and hurry up about it ! ”
93364	93370	93361	93361	I	1777	“ You should write poetry , ”
93418	93421	93422	93422	he	1777	“ Off ! ”
93555	93568	93569	93569	He	1777	“ So fucking sweet . I ’d knew you ’d taste sweet . ”
93715	93719	93720	93720	he	1777	“ Close already ? ”
93745	93752	93753	93753	he	1777	“ You ’re so goddamn beautiful , ”
93756	93764	93765	93765	He	1777	“ I wish you could see yourself . ”
93792	93797	93798	93798	He	1777	“ This beautiful skin . ”
93803	93808	93809	93809	He	1777	“ These perfect tits . ”
93835	93888	93827	93827	His	1777	“ And this gorgeous pussy . Look at you , spread open for me , all pink and soft . Christ . I ca n’t decide if I want to eat you until you come and then fuck you , or if I should make you come on my hard cock first . ”
93903	93906	93907	93907	I	1777	“ Please , ”
93911	93914	93907	93907	I	1777	“ Jax . ”

94366	94371	94372	94372	Jackson	487	“ Hush , sweetheart , ”
94433	94438	94439	94439	he	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
94572	94590	94560	94560	I	1777	“ Sorry . I ’m not normally a weeper after sex . But that was . . . ”
94607	94621	94601	94601	He	0	“ Do n’t apologize . I feel like a sex god right now . ”
94672	94704	94669	94669	I	1777	“ You are a sex god , Jax . You ’re the Michael Jordan of sex . You ’re the Warren Buffett of sex . You ’re the Steve Jobs of — ”
94705	94708	94709	94709	he	0	“ Okay , ”

95272	95276	95277	95277	I	1777	“ Holy guacamole , ”

97248	97263	97240	97240	I	1777	“ No . It ’s like someone just told me I won the lottery . ”
97264	97271	97293	97293	she	58	“ Do billionaires play the lottery ? ”
97272	97283	97240	97240	I	1777	“ They would if they knew you were the prize . ”
97327	97333	97334	97334	she	58	“ I need a shower , ”
97346	97364	97334	97334	she	58	“ God , those filthy eyes . You could probably be arrested for that look . Pervert . ”
97369	97399	97365	97365	She	58	“ Well , since we ’re doing a sex weekend before we go back to real life , I might as well make the most of it , right ? ”
97533	97549	97526	97526	She	58	“ it would be a good idea if we got it out of our systems . ”
97565	97568	97569	97569	I	1777	“ Right , ”
97584	97600	97576	97576	She	58	“ What ’s that face you ’re making ? I do n’t recognize that face . ”
97608	97611	97612	97612	I	1777	“ Nothing , ”
97616	97621	97612	97612	I	1777	“ I ’m fine . ”
97654	97657	97658	97658	she	58	“ No ! ”
97661	97703	97658	97658	she	58	“ No , you do n’t get to do that after you were just inside me not even five minutes ago ! You do not get to be all weird and withdrawn and noncommunicative , do you hear me ? Talk ! ”
97759	97769	97770	97770	I	1777	“ I told you once would n’t be enough , ”
97780	97785	97770	97770	I	1777	“ So ? And ? ”
97796	97799	97800	97800	I	1777	“ So , ”
97803	97809	97810	97810	Her	58	“ you fucking seduced me ! ”
97823	97915	97817	97817	I	1777	“ And now you ’re telling me this weekend is all I ’m getting ! And I already told you I did n’t want to fuck this up ! So now it ’s too late because it is fucked up because I wo n’t be able to have you just once and I ’m going to go fucking insane trying to keep my hands off you now , because to you this was only sex but to me it was a lot more , and you told me I was beautiful ! ”
97960	97965	97966	97966	she	58	“ Oh , Jax , ”
97970	97983	97966	97966	she	58	“ We ’re going to have to do something about that temper . ”
98000	98005	98006	98006	she	58	“ Kiss me back ! ”
98018	98033	98015	98015	I	1777	“ Are you having some sort of psychotic break I should be aware of ? ”
98055	98074	98034	98034	She	58	“ You conveniently forgot about the ‘ ten or twenty times ’ part of our conversation , Beastie . ”
98086	98114	98082	98082	she	58	“ And the part where I asked if that would all be in one day and you said you ’d need a lot more time than that ? ”
98157	98179	98180	98180	She	58	“ I ’ll be very clear , since you seem to be having trouble processing what I ’m trying to say . ”
98188	98214	98180	98180	She	58	“ Mr. Boudreaux . When I said we were having a sex weekend , I did n’t mean we were only having a sex weekend . ”
98244	98308	98241	98241	she	58	“ I ’m not putting any rules on this . When I said sex did n’t have to change anything , that was the truth . I hope it does n’t make things awkward when we get home if — if — one of us decides it ’s better to remain friends . Seeing as how this is a business deal and all . ”
98318	98322	98323	98323	she	58	“ I know , ”
98326	98362	98323	98323	she	58	“ It ’s an odd situation . For us both , obviously . But if it even has a chance to work out , we have to promise to be completely honest with each other . ”
98369	98390	98323	98323	she	58	“ And I was being honest when I said I thought you were beautiful . So . There ’s that . ”
98401	98409	98398	98398	I	1777	“ You ’re not so bad yourself . ”
98415	98428	98410	98410	She	58	“ Such flowery , romantic words ! Oh , I ’m overcome ! ”
98594	98597	98598	98598	he	372	“ Jackson , ”
98603	98607	98598	98598	he	372	“ Good morning . ”
98699	98702	98703	98703	he	372	“ Son , ”
98710	98715	98716	98716	He	372	“ Oh , son . ”
98725	98735	98716	98716	He	372	“ It ’s so good to have you home . ”
98828	98833	98812	98813	A servant	1347	“ Breakfast , sir ? ”
98869	98876	98878	98879	my father	372	“ We owe you an apology , ”
98928	98938	98939	98939	he	372	“ Oh , now do n’t gimme that face , ”
98949	98971	98939	98939	he	372	“ You ’re not innocent in all of this , either ! You never even told us we had a grandson ! ”
98996	99052	98939	98939	he	372	“ Yes , Bianca told me you adopted Christian ’s son , and I ’m damned pissed off that you ’d keep that from us ! You know how much your mother wants grandbabies ! And you could ’ve told me what really happened with Cricket — it would ’ve saved us years of grief ! ”
99060	99150	99053	99053	He	372	“ Not that it was anything like what you probably went through , of course . I did n’t mean that . Only . . . well , shit , Jackson . You never gave your mother and me a chance to be there for you . You just disappeared , and when Rayford found you , he would n’t tell us anything , either , and we never saw either one of you again ! It was like the two of you went into the witness protection program ! ”
99163	99168	99169	99169	I	1777	“ But . . . ”
99175	99182	99169	99169	I	1777	“ I gave you a stroke . ”
99204	99276	99200	99201	my father	372	“ You ca n’t take credit for that , boy ! Your mother ’s been on a blood thinner for twenty years because she ’d had a minor stroke before you were born and the doctors were tryin ’ to prevent another one ! Sticky blood runs in her side of the family ! Jesus H. Christ on a crutch , what nonsense ! And this is why you stayed away ? ”
99289	99304	99281	99281	I	1777	“ I stayed away because you loved Linc more than you ever loved me ! ”
99326	99331	99333	99334	my mother	370	“ Jackson Walker Boudreaux , ”
99355	99367	99349	99349	Her	370	“ That is a terrible thing to say , and untrue ! ”
99373	99392	99368	99369	My father	908	“ Well now you ’ve done it . Congratulations , boy . You ’ve made your mother cry . ”
99463	99571	99445	99445	he	908	“ Now you listen to me real good , son , because I ’m only gon na say this once . We love you . We love you now , we loved you then , we ’ll love you until we die . You ’re our son . We know we were n’t perfect parents , but you were a handful . Maybe we did n’t always know the right way to deal with you , but we never loved you less than your brother . Never . And we never blamed you for his death , either , even though I know you think we did . ”
99581	99633	99578	99578	he	1777	“ That ’s right . I ’m not stupid . You got my blood in your veins , you think I do n’t know what you ’re thinkin ’ ? But you ’re a stubborn SOB — just like me . Once you get your mind set , that ’s it . ”
99648	99694	99642	99642	he	1777	“ But it was my fault for leavin ’ it alone for so long . I shoulda . . . done something . I do n’t know . Made you talk to me . But gettin ’ you to talk is like pullin ’ teeth . ”
99711	99775	99695	99695	He	1777	“ Anyway . The bottom line is that the past is past . We ’re gon na have a new daughter - in - law . It ’s time we started actin ’ like a family again . By the way , we love Bianca . What a firecracker . Hopefully we ’ll have another grandbaby or two by this time next year . ”
99798	99807	99809	99810	my father	1721	“ Well , look at that , Clemmy , ”
99812	99828	99809	99810	my father	1721	“ Ha ! I ’ve left him speechless . Score one for the old man . ”
99861	99880	99842	99843	The servant	267	“ I hope you still like these , sir . Thought you might need it . Welcome home . ”
100047	100052	100053	100053	he	267	“ Do n’t stop , ”
100058	100069	100053	100053	he	267	“ I still have ten percent of my hearing left . ”
100241	100265	100238	100238	I	1777	“ I ’ll have you know I won a talent contest once with my excellent rendition of ‘ You Are My Sunshine . ’ ”
100313	100323	100310	100310	He	267	“ Really ? How old were you ? Seven ? ”
100324	100327	100328	100328	I	1777	“ Eight . ”
100331	100334	100328	100328	I	1777	“ Jerk . ”
100338	100348	100349	100349	He	267	“ You do n’t think I ’m a jerk . ”
100373	100382	100370	100370	He	267	“ In fact I think you like me . ”
100462	100465	100466	100466	I	1777	“ Maybe , ”
100477	100484	100472	100472	he	267	“ The jury ’s still out . ”
100531	100543	100528	100528	He	267	“ You said you would n’t lie to me , sweetheart , ”
100571	100580	100567	100567	he	267	“ Any other lies you want to tell ? ”
100581	100592	100550	100550	his	267	“ Um . I felt nothing when you did that ? ”
100593	100602	100603	100603	he	267	“ Oh , that ’s a good one , ”
100619	100632	100603	100603	he	267	“ You must be shivering because it ’s so cold in here . ”
100649	100652	100640	100640	I	1777	“ Definitely . ”
100815	100821	100822	100822	he	267	“ I love this belly , ”
100835	100854	100826	100826	He	267	“ And these . So pretty . So perfect . Look how perfectly they fit in my hands . ”
100928	100932	100933	100933	he	267	“ And this , ”
100950	100977	100933	100933	he	267	“ I love this . I want this in my mouth or my hands or on my cock every day for the rest of my life . ”
101056	101066	101068	101068	Jackson	487	“ I love your sweet little noises , too , ”
101076	101084	101068	101068	Jackson	487	“ Bianca . You ’re so sweet . ”
101164	101167	101168	101168	He	267	“ God . ”
101247	101262	101263	101263	His	267	“ You ’re the sexiest fucking woman I ’ve ever seen in my life . ”
101314	101318	101319	101319	I	1777	“ Like this , ”
101350	101353	101359	101359	he	267	“ Hurry . ”
101427	101430	101431	101431	he	267	“ Sorry , ”
101441	101450	101434	101434	My	1777	“ You ’re forgiven . Do it again . ”
101528	101533	101534	101534	he	267	“ She likes that , ”
101599	101608	101609	101609	I	1777	“ I do n’t want this to stop , ”
101621	101629	101609	101609	I	1777	“ Jax . Do n’t ever stop . ”
101630	101636	101637	101637	he	267	“ It wo n’t stop , ”
101644	101653	101637	101637	he	267	“ I promise . Now quit holding back . ”
101835	101844	101845	101845	he	267	“ You ’ve ruined me for anyone else , ”
101854	101861	101845	101845	he	267	“ Bianca . I ’m ruined . ”
101901	101904	101905	101905	he	267	“ Fuck , ”
101991	102003	102004	102004	I	1777	“ Not yet . Let ’s not talk about it yet , ”
102067	102072	102073	102073	Jackson	487	“ You need food , ”
102108	102113	102114	102114	I	1777	“ Food ! Yes ! ”
102204	102211	102212	102212	he	0	“ And maybe a stiff drink , ”
102249	102258	102232	102232	I	1777	“ So did you talk to your parents ? ”
102266	102270	102262	102262	his	0	“ I did . ”
102280	102283	102271	102271	He	0	“ And ? ”

102415	102420	102422	102422	Jackson	487	“ Uh - oh , ”
102424	102434	102422	102422	Jackson	487	“ I smell smoke . You ’re thinking again . ”
102435	102454	102455	102455	He	0	“ Ha ha . Can we please go get some food before I eat that bar of soap ? ”
102477	102518	102455	102455	He	0	“ Yep . But you have to promise if this little breakdown you ’re having gets any worse , you ’ll talk to me , so I wo n’t have to hold you down and tickle it out of you . ”
102528	102539	102519	102519	I	1777	“ You will not tickle me . Ever . Understood ? ”
102550	102562	102540	102540	He	0	“ Sorry , sweetheart , that ’s not in the contract . ”
102621	102632	102633	102633	I	1777	“ It is n’t fair that you ’re so giant , ”
102636	102641	102633	102633	I	1777	“ And freakishly strong . ”
102642	102653	102682	102682	He	0	“ I ’m not that strong , but thank you . ”
102654	102681	102633	102633	I	1777	“ Honey , you ’re holding up my entire weight like I ’m a loaf of bread . One of the airy kinds , like sourdough . ”
102692	102695	102696	102696	he	0	“ Honey ? ”
102749	102774	102742	102742	I	1777	“ It was a slip of the tongue . I ’m getting lightheaded from lack of food . I could faint at any moment . ”
102787	102806	102775	102775	He	0	“ I see . You ’re still in fibbing mode . All right , I ’ll let it go until”—he

102829	102832	102826	102826	I	1777	“ Showoff . ”

103584	103587	103588	103588	Jackson	487	“ Bianca ? ”
103602	103607	103596	103596	he	1583	“ What is it ? ”
103621	103624	103625	103625	I	1777	“ Mama , ”
103633	103638	103625	103625	I	1777	“ She ’s dead . ”
103817	103828	103829	103829	she	487	“ I need to get back as soon as possible , ”
103874	103896	103897	103897	She	487	“ Of course . The plane can be ready within the hour . I ’ll make sure the bags get packed . ”

104389	104409	104383	104383	she	1595	“ I ’m Jennifer Wright , from Home Angels Health Care . I ’m so sorry for your loss . ”
104435	104484	104485	104485	Jennifer	243	“ I was assigned the afternoon shift . Gina , who was here in the morning , said your mother was resting comfortably when she left at noon . She had a little lunch , then went to take a nap . Then she must ’ve . . . ”
104500	104512	104496	104496	she	243	“ Apparently Eeny arrived just before I did , at four . ”
104524	104540	104513	104513	Eeny	954	“ She looked like she was sleepin ’ ! So peaceful , like an angel — ”
104582	104588	104589	104589	he	1598	“ The paramedics were called ? ”
104606	104609	104610	104610	she	243	“ Yes , ”
104616	104653	104610	104610	she	243	“ They tried to resuscitate her . When that failed , they asked if we wanted to transfer Mrs. Hardwick to the hospital or make arrangements with a funeral home to pick up her remains here . ”
104689	104717	104685	104685	Jennifer	243	“ Eeny and I thought it would be best if Mrs. Hardwick stayed where she was until her daughter arrived . I hope that was all right ? ”
104718	104721	104722	104722	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
104749	104755	104742	104742	she	243	“ Thank you , Jennifer . ”

104804	104819	104801	104801	I	1777	“ I want a minute alone with her , if you do n’t mind . ”
104820	104854	104777	104777	Jackson	487	“ Of course not . Take all the time you need . I ’ll call Robertson ’s Funeral Home and get the arrangements started , unless there ’s somewhere else you ’d rather — ”
104855	104860	104861	104861	I	1777	“ That ’s fine , ”
105080	105089	105090	105090	I	1777	“ I ca n’t believe you left me , ”
105278	105285	105275	105275	I	1777	“ Tell Daddy I miss him , ”

105595	105607	105608	105608	I	1777	“ Cancel all the reservations for the rest of the week , ”

105629	105647	105687	105687	Jackson	487	“ Should I call anyone for you , boo ? People will want to know Davina passed . ”
105648	105651	105652	105652	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
105659	105685	105652	105652	I	1777	“ Call everyone . I ’ll let you know as soon as I schedule the funeral service with the church . Thank you , Eeny . ”
105690	105704	105687	105687	Jackson	487	“ Tell the restaurant employees they ’ll be paid for the days off , ”
105779	105785	105786	105786	he	1777	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
105795	105802	105786	105786	he	1777	“ She was a lovely woman . ”
105833	105855	105856	105856	I	1777	“ Yes . Thank you . For everything you ’ve done , thank you . You ’ve been a great help . ”
105920	105927	105915	105915	Jackson	487	“ You ’re staying here tonight ? ”
105954	105957	105958	105958	I	1777	“ Yes , ”
106007	106019	106004	106004	He	1777	“ Is there anything I can do ? Anything you need ? ”
106029	106032	106033	106033	he	1777	“ Okay , ”
106037	106052	106033	106033	he	1777	“ Then I ’ll just . . . I guess I ’ll just go . ”
106121	106129	106118	106118	He	1777	“ Call me if you need anything . ”
106395	106398	106422	106422	I	1777	“ Hello ? ”
106399	106402	106404	106405	the Colonel	408	“ Bianca , ”
106409	106421	106404	106405	the Colonel	408	“ Oh , Bianca , tell me it is n’t true ! ”
106434	106451	106422	106422	I	1777	“ I ca n’t believe it , either . It ’s impossible that she ’s gone . ”
106487	106494	106495	106496	the Colonel	408	“ Was it a heart attack ? ”
106505	106539	106495	106496	the Colonel	408	“ I do n’t know . She did n’t want an autopsy , so we wo n’t know the exact cause of death , but the chemo was really hard on her system . ”
106546	106549	106495	106496	the Colonel	408	“ Chemo ? ”
106550	106556	106557	106557	I	1777	“ She had lung cancer , ”
106560	106577	106557	106557	I	1777	“ She ’s been on chemo for weeks . She was scheduled for surgery on Wednesday . ”
106592	106611	106578	106579	The Colonel	408	“ Cancer ? My God ! She never said a word — I thought she had the flu ! ”
106612	106627	106578	106579	The Colonel	408	“ I know . I ’m sorry . That ’s what she told everyone . ”
106642	106649	106650	106650	he	408	“ You know what I think ? ”
106657	106662	106650	106650	he	408	“ No . What ? ”
106703	106737	106700	106700	He	408	“ I think she was just tired of bein ’ without your daddy , and now that you ’re settled , she decided it was time for her to be on her way . ”
106756	106827	106700	106700	He	408	“ I loved your mama , Bianca . She was a good woman , and I ’ll miss her somethin’ fierce . But I always knew she ’d given her heart away a long time ago . I knew she ’d never stop loving your daddy , but I ’m grateful for the time we spent together because she made me happy . She made the world a better place . ”
106855	106872	106850	106851	The Colonel	408	“ Is there anything you need , darlin ’ ? Anything I can do for you ? ”
107184	107189	107176	107176	I	1777	“ That ’s fine . ”
107572	107578	107579	107579	he	1656	“ Let ’s sit down , ”
107588	107594	107579	107579	he	1656	“ We need to talk . ”
107639	107642	107668	107668	I	1777	“ Jackson ? ”
107671	107676	107668	107668	I	1777	“ What is it ? ”
107698	107721	107689	107689	he	1656	“ We do n’t have to draw this out any longer than necessary . I wanted to wait until after . . . ”
107734	107758	107722	107722	He	1656	“ I knew you had so much on your plate . I wanted to wait until after the funeral to give you this . ”
107765	107774	107759	107759	He	1656	“ It ’s my copy of our contract . ”
107786	107792	107779	107779	I	1777	“ I do n’t understand . ”
107844	107863	107841	107841	he	1656	“ You did n’t think I ’d force you to go through with it now , did you ? ”
107896	107915	107879	107879	he	1656	“ Please tell me you do n’t think I ’m the kind of man who would do that . ”
107929	107935	107936	107936	I	1777	“ We made an agreement , ”
107946	107950	107936	107936	I	1777	“ Your inheritance — ”
107951	107968	107969	107969	he	1656	“ It has n’t been about my inheritance for me for a while now , Bianca , ”
107977	107988	107969	107969	he	1656	“ Honestly , I ’m not sure it ever was . ”
108001	108004	107998	107998	I	1777	“ Jax . ”
108030	108056	108014	108014	He	1656	“ I ’ll have all your things brought back here . I ’m sorry you had to let go of your house . The timing was just”—his
108059	108061	108014	108014	He	1656	hollow—“shit . ”
108136	108145	108146	108146	I	1777	“ I ca n’t let you do that , ”
108218	108242	108206	108206	He	1656	“ Do n’t you get it ? You ’re not obligated to me anymore ! You ’re free ! Go live your life ! ”
108270	108275	108276	108276	he	1656	“ I ’m sorry , ”
108287	108321	108276	108276	he	1656	“ Fuck . I ’m so sorry . I ’m an asshole . I know this is the worst day of your life . I did n’t mean to — I ca n’t — ”
108336	108341	108342	108342	he	1656	“ Keep the ring , ”
108348	108379	108342	108342	he	1656	“ Hock it . Throw it away . Whatever you want . I ’ll send all your things tomorrow . Let me know if there ’s anything else you need . ”
108400	108403	108388	108388	I	1777	“ Thank you ”
108405	108410	108388	108388	I	1777	“ Do n’t go . ”
108609	108669	108670	108670	Eeny	954	“ Get off your behind , girl , and get back to work ! Who do you think you ’re honorin ’ with all this mopin ’ around ? Because it sure ai n’t your mama ! She ’d be scandalized if she could see you right now , lyin ’ there wallowin ’ like a pig in shit ! ”
108708	108713	108714	108714	I	1777	“ You ’re right , ”
108723	108730	108714	108714	I	1777	“ I know you ’re right . ”
108731	108742	108743	108743	She	954	“ Then get your ass in gear and get up ! ”
108755	108770	108714	108714	I	1777	“ I ’m in mourning . You should n’t curse at people in mourning . ”
108781	108796	108771	108771	She	954	“ You ’re in danger of gettin ’ on my bad side , boo . ”
108840	108845	108846	108846	I	1777	“ I ’m up , ”
108851	108854	108846	108846	I	1777	“ Terrorist . ”
108855	108907	108933	108933	Eeny	954	“ You ’re the terrorist , child . Have you looked in a mirror lately ? You ’re so frightenin ’ I ’d hire you to haunt a house ! You ’re so scary lookin ’ you ’d make a freight train take a dirt road ! You look so bad — ”
108908	108917	108918	108918	I	1777	“ I get it , I get it , ”
108926	108932	108918	108918	I	1777	“ I look like crap . ”
108946	108964	108933	108933	Eeny	954	“ Like you fell out the ugly tree and hit every damn branch on the way down . ”
108982	109008	108965	108965	I	1777	“ Lawd ! That breath of yours is nuclear , girl ! Ca n’t believe it has n’t melted the lips right off your face . ”
109028	109081	109082	109082	she	954	“ That ’s better . Now go take a shower and put on some clean clothes . We ’re goin’ to the restaurant . You got people to feed , and I miss that ornery ol’ billy goat Hoyt more than I ever woulda guessed . Do n’t gimme that stink eye ! ”
109090	109105	109082	109082	she	954	“ And if you repeat that to anyone , I ’ll mash your potatoes ! ”
109106	109112	109082	109082	she	954	“ My lips are sealed . ”
109163	109166	109177	109177	He	1667	“ Hello ? ”
109167	109176	109177	109177	He	1667	“ Miss Hardwick , it ’s Michael Roth . ”
109191	109201	109177	109177	He	1667	“ How can I help you , Mr. Roth ? ”
109202	109217	109177	109177	He	1667	“ I received a copy of the trust documents from Mr. Boudreaux ’s attorney . ”
109218	109240	109241	109241	I	1777	“ Oh . Yes , um , well Mr. Boudreaux and I . . . the contract you reviewed . . . ”
109244	109266	109241	109241	I	1777	“ Mr. Boudreaux does n’t want to move forward with the marriage , so the contract is void at this point . ”
109287	109294	109284	109284	He	1667	“ But the trust is n’t . ”
109302	109305	109295	109295	I	1777	“ Hmm ? ”
109306	109321	109330	109330	his	1667	“ Miss Hardwick , did you seek legal counsel before signing the trust documents ? ”
109348	109355	109356	109356	I	1777	“ Well . . . no , ”
109360	109369	109356	109356	I	1777	“ The whole thing was a little rushed — ”
109370	109384	109385	109385	he	1667	“ The trust is n’t linked in any way to the marriage contract , ”
109405	109429	109389	109389	I	1777	“ Mr. Roth , you ’ll have to speak English . I have n’t had my coffee yet . What ’re you saying ? ”
109435	109447	109432	109432	his	1667	“ I ’m saying Mr. Boudreaux gifted you a million dollars . ”
109465	109497	109459	109459	I	1777	“ No , that ca n’t be right . The trust is part of the marriage contract . The two go together . Without a marriage , there ’s no money . ”
109518	109591	109498	109499	Mr. Roth	250	“ There is no mention of establishing a trust in the marriage contract , Miss Hardwick . As far as the contract is concerned , the trust does n’t exist . There was only a stipulation that a payment in the amount of one million dollars would be conferred to you upon your marriage , but it never specifically spelled out how that payment would be made . This trust I ’ve just reviewed”—I
109600	109632	109498	109499	Mr. Roth	250	background—“is ironclad . It ’s irrevocable . You are the sole trustee . No one else has access to the money . That million dollars is yours , married or not . ”
109638	109690	109633	109633	I	1777	“ Mr. Roth . Respectfully , you ’re talking out of your behind . I know you graduated from college , because I saw the framed degree on the wall behind your desk , but you ’ve got this all wrong . Jackson Boudreaux would never make such a stupid mistake . ”
109698	109710	109694	109695	Mr. Roth	250	“ I agree . He would n’t . It was intentional . ”
109719	109737	109738	109738	He	250	“ Of course if you do n’t believe me , I advise you to get another opinion . ”
109748	109769	109738	109738	He	250	“ But any attorney will tell you the same thing . Congratulations , Miss Hardwick . You ’re a millionaire . ”
109773	109783	109770	109770	I	1777	“ I ’m . . . whaaa . . . ”
109850	109854	109855	109855	I	1777	“ Hardwick residence , ”
109884	109887	109889	109889	Trace	79	“ Bianca , ”
109914	109924	109925	109925	I	1777	“ You ’ve got some nerve calling this house ! ”
109944	109956	109931	109931	He	79	“ What , I ca n’t call to pay my respects ? ”
109986	110006	109960	109960	he	79	“ I ’m only going to tell you this one more time , Trace . Stay away from me . ”
110007	110011	110012	110012	he	79	“ Or what ? ”
110015	110033	110012	110012	he	79	“ You ’ll have Jackson Boudreaux buy up the whole block instead of just the one building ? ”
110034	110043	110044	110044	I	1777	“ What the heck are you talking about ? ”
110080	110090	110012	110012	he	79	“ You know exactly what I ’m talking about ! ”
110100	110132	110097	110097	he	79	“ My restaurant ? The building it was going to open in suddenly getting bought up even though it was n’t on the market ? The new owner canceling my lease ? ”
110158	110178	110154	110154	I	1777	“ Jackson bought the building where you were going to open your restaurant , and then canceled your lease ? ”
110189	110199	110200	110200	he	79	“ You ’re a shitty actress , bumble bee , ”
110204	110222	110200	110200	he	79	“ Do n’t think for a minute I do n’t know who asked him to do it . ”
110337	110343	110334	110334	He	79	“ You ’re fucking stupid ! ”
110350	110356	110344	110344	I	1777	“ And you ’re proof ! ”
110362	110388	110359	110359	he	79	“ You need me ! You told me you ’d always love me ! ‘ I will always love you’—those were your exact goddamn words ! ”
110419	110454	110415	110415	I	1777	“ I ’m not Whitney Houston , you silly goose . I need you like the word knife needs the letter k. The only thing you ever gave me was dick and a headache . ”
110467	110474	110475	110475	she	954	“ Who on earth was that ? ”
110482	110504	110459	110459	Eeny	954	“ Snake oil salesman . I told him to find the nearest tall building and go stand out on a ledge . ”
110518	110524	110505	110505	She	954	“ You okay , boo ? ”
110613	110700	110610	110610	I	1777	“ Eeny . Jackson Boudreaux asked my mama for permission to marry me when he did n’t have to . He gave me a seven - carat Tiffany diamond ring when I said I wanted a simple gold band . He gave me a million dollars in cash , for nothing . And bought an entire building so a man who ’d hurt me could n’t hurt me again . And told me his deepest , darkest secrets — things he ’d never told anyone before . ”
110708	110714	110701	110701	Eeny	954	“ What ’s your point ? ”
110743	110754	110740	110740	I	1777	“ I think Jackson Boudreaux is in love with me . ”
110768	110799	110755	110755	Eeny	954	“ Of course he ’s in love with you , dummy ! A blind man could see that ! Stars above , do n’t tell me you did n’t know ? ”
110816	110847	110808	110808	she	954	“ How I ’m supposed to deal with this kind of ignorance I surely do n’t know ! Heavens to Betsy , Bianca , sometimes you can be awful dense ! ”
110857	110882	110854	110854	I	1777	“ I thought love was supposed to be weak knees and butterflies in your stomach and a terrible longing that could never be quenched . ”
110896	110901	110902	110902	she	954	“ No , child , ”
110910	110978	110902	110902	she	954	“ That ’s romance . Romance is built on doubt . Love is solid . Constant . If you ’re not careful , you might mistake it for bein ’ boring because it ’s so reliable . Love is warm and deep and comfortable , just right , so you float in it peacefully without ever being scalded or frozen , like a perfect , relaxing bubble bath .
110979	111062	110883	110883	Eeny	954	“ But it ’s also fierce and strong and demands all the best parts of you , the parts that are giving and honest and true . Love makes you a better person . It makes you want to be a better person . You know it ’s love when you feel comfortable just as you are , when you feel seen and understood , when you know you could tell all your darkest truths and they ’d be accepted without judgement . ”
111075	111162	111063	111063	Eeny	954	“ Love is n’t butterflies , boo . It is n’t weak knees . It ’s a pride of lions . It ’s a pack of wolves . It ’s ‘ I ’ve got your back even if it costs me my own life , ’ because unlike romance that fizzles at the first sign of trouble , love will fight to the death . When it ’s love , you ’ll go to war to avenge even the slightest offense . And you ’ll be justified .
111163	111190	110902	110902	she	954	“ Because of all the marvelous and terrible things we can experience in this life , love is the only one that will last beyond it . ”
111233	111237	111238	111238	I	1777	“ Oh God , ”
111246	111258	111238	111238	I	1777	“ I love him , Eeny ! I love Jackson Boudreaux ! ”
111273	111287	111259	111259	Eeny	954	“ Honestly , Jesus , how can you burden me with such stupidity ? ”
111288	111321	111322	111322	I	1777	“ I have to call him , I ’ve got to call him right now , oh Lord what is the matter with me , I ’m an A - plus idiot , ”
111390	111397	111383	111383	Rayford	1721	“ Good evening , Boudreaux residence . ”
111404	111422	111398	111398	I	1777	“ Rayford it ’s Bianca I need to speak with Jackson please put him on the phone ! ”
111428	111440	111441	111441	he	1721	“ Mr. Boudreaux is . . . occupied at the moment , ”
111450	111457	111441	111441	he	1721	“ May I take a message ? ”
111469	111491	111463	111463	I	1777	“ Occupied ? No , Rayford , you do n’t understand , it ’s very important that I speak with him — ”
111492	111503	111504	111504	he	1721	“ I ’m sorry , but that ’s not possible , ”
111508	111518	111504	111504	he	1721	“ Is there anything I can help you with ? ”
111551	111554	111555	111555	I	1777	“ Rayford , ”
111569	111575	111555	111555	I	1777	“ what ’s going on ? ”
111597	111621	111590	111590	he	1721	“ Mr. Boudreaux has a guest . I ’ll be happy to tell him you called , however . Have a nice evening . ”
111659	111662	111656	111656	Eeny	954	“ Well ? ”
111670	111678	111667	111667	I	1777	“ What day is it , Eeny ? ”
111684	111689	111679	111679	She	954	“ It ’s Tuesday . ”
111690	111696	111697	111697	I	1777	“ No , the date ! ”
111704	111710	111697	111697	I	1777	“ What ’s the date ? ”
111711	111717	111679	111679	She	954	“ The sixteenth . Why ? ”
111756	111759	111743	111743	He	1721	“ guest . ”
111842	111847	111834	111834	I	1777	“ Who was that ? ”

111855	111865	111852	111852	he	1721	“ Annual fund - raising for the local police . ”
111874	111897	111867	111867	I	1777	“ I wonder why the chief did n’t call me himself ? He knows I do n’t like to talk to telemarketers . ”
111904	111920	111867	111867	I	1777	“ Did n’t they just have the police fund - raiser a few months ago ? ”
111927	111949	111921	111921	Rayford	1721	“ You write so many checks for fund - raisers , sir , I can never remember which one ’s which . ”
111973	111976	111921	111921	Rayford	1721	“ Refill ? ”
112003	112008	112009	112009	He	1721	“ Yes . Thanks . ”

112192	112207	112177	112178	Miss Taylor	1721	“ Section four D could be problematic . I think it ’s too vague . ”
112312	112316	112317	112317	I	1777	“ Four D , ”
112325	112328	112317	112317	I	1777	“ Right . ”

112446	112461	112466	112466	Taylor	1721	“ You made an odd sound . Like you were trying to say something . ”
112488	112493	112494	112494	I	1777	“ Thinking out loud , ”
112501	112504	112494	112494	I	1777	“ Sorry . ”
112536	112540	112541	112541	she	58	“ Mr. Boudreaux , ”

112566	112580	112560	112560	I	1777	“ Yes . I need to stretch my legs . Back in ten . ”
112593	112600	112601	112601	she	58	“ I ’ll be right here , ”
112796	112800	112801	112801	I	1777	“ Fucking hell , ”
113351	113356	113357	113357	she	58	“ And another thing ! ”
113362	113371	113357	113357	she	58	“ You really should n’t wear brown lipstick ! ”
113372	113379	113381	113381	Rayford	1721	“ Well hello there , sir , ”
113384	113401	113402	113402	His	1721	“ As you can see , Miss Bianca and Miss Taylor were just gettin ’ acquainted . ”

113433	113436	113437	113437	I	1777	“ Bianca , ”
113444	113451	113437	113437	I	1777	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
113474	113490	113471	113471	She	58	“ I ’m here to stop the man I love from marrying the wrong woman ! ”
113512	113515	113509	113509	I	1777	“ Love ? ”
113522	113536	113491	113491	Taylor	1721	“ Yes , that ’s right . I love you , Jackson Boudreaux ! ”
113556	113570	113552	113552	you	1710	“ The tumor is inoperable and I only have a week to live . ”
113591	113654	113572	113572	she	58	“ I ’m sorry I did n’t realize it sooner , but I think I ’m just about as stubborn as you are . You ’re the best man I ’ve ever known , and I ’ll be damned if I ’m gon na let you hitch your wagon to some cash - hungry bottom - feeder just to save your inheritance ! ”
113665	113668	113655	113655	She	58	“ Oh ! ”
113697	113772	113694	113694	She	58	“ My whole life I ’ve been waiting for someone like you . Only I did n’t know that someone would come with a caveman beard and a bossy streak and a scowl that could peel paint from the walls . And then you came at me with your ridiculous proposal , and then Mama died , and then I lost my mind , so it took me a minute to figure it out . ”
113785	113843	113777	113777	she	58	“ But I love you , Jackson . And I hope you know that I do n’t give a damn about your money , because I do n’t . In fact I think it would do you a world of good to flush that inheritance right down the toilet and live like a normal person for once . ”
113848	113875	113844	113844	She	58	“ I ’ve recently been informed by my attorney that I ’m a millionaire , anyway , so it ’s not like we ’d be broke . ”
113879	113890	113844	113844	She	58	“ Mr. Boudreaux , will you please tell this woman — ”
113891	113897	113898	113898	I	1777	“ Shut up , Taylor , ”
113965	114040	113961	113961	Bianca	58	“ We went about this whole thing ass backward . Marriage proposals are supposed to come after you ’ve fallen in love , not before , but I have a feeling nothing we ’re ever going to do will be in the proper order . So what I ’m proposing is that you tell this skinny little mercenary with the weird brown lips to go pound sand , and you and me get married . ”
114049	114058	114041	114041	Her	58	“ Because I would like to date you . ”
114108	114119	114105	114105	I	1777	“ That skinny little mercenary is my attorney , sweetheart . ”
114132	114135	114123	114123	Her	58	“ What ? ”
114160	114205	114123	114123	Her	58	“ Taylor is my attorney . Has been for years . We ’re not getting married . We ’re working on the contract for the new division Boudreaux Bourbon ’s going to open in New Orleans . The one I ’m going to run . ”
114215	114220	114212	114212	She	58	“ Contract ? Division ? ”
114224	114263	114221	114221	I	1777	“ My father and I had a long talk after you and I left Kentucky . We agreed that opening a new distillery in Louisiana would be good for business . There ’s no wedding going on here . ”
114286	114291	114283	114283	she	58	“ Oh , shit . ”
114311	114320	114303	114303	Bianca	58	“ Rayford ! You did that on purpose ! ”
114324	114336	114321	114321	He	1721	“ Sometimes you got ta give the blind a helping hand . ”
114352	114413	114342	114342	She	58	“ I am so , so sorry . Oh my goodness . I take back what I said . You ’re not a mercenary . I ’m sure you ’re a wonderful woman . You look very . . . smart . And you ’re not skinny , that was just me being jealous . You have a lovely figure . ”
114422	114428	114414	114414	Taylor	1721	“ And the brown lipstick ? ”
114432	114437	114429	114429	Bianca	58	“ Well . . . ”
114438	114445	114429	114429	Bianca	58	“ Enough apologies . Come here . ”
114500	114506	114507	114507	she	58	“ What about your inheritance ? ”
114514	114552	114553	114553	I	1777	“ It was get married or work for the company , remember ? Not that I care about the money anymore . It was just time for me to let go of the past and grow up . ”
114559	114584	114553	114553	I	1777	“ You ’re responsible for that , you know . I never would ’ve reconnected with my parents if it were n’t for you . ”
114593	114605	114585	114585	Bianca	58	“ So you do n’t need to get married after all . ”
114618	114623	114624	114624	I	1777	“ Technically , no , ”
114627	114633	114624	114624	I	1777	“ But I want to . ”
114649	114671	114634	114634	She	58	“ And I noticed you ’re still wearing your engagement ring , so I think you still want to , too . ”
114691	114730	114688	114688	she	58	“ I just want you . Rich , poor , smiling , growling , bearded or clean - shaven , I just want you , Jax . There ’s nothing in the world I want more than you . ”
114742	114752	114753	114753	I	1777	“ Be careful what you wish for , sweetheart , ”
114760	114781	114753	114753	I	1777	“ If you think I ’m a beast , you have n’t seen this beard when it really gets going . ”
114809	114815	114788	114788	She	58	“ I can hardly wait . ”
