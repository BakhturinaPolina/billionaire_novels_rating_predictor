5757	5777	5778	5778	She	80	“ And his cousin the rugby player is staying in his apartment ! They traded off , you see ? ”
5833	5914	5922	5922	she	432	“ Blessica ran into him this morning when she went to walk the dogs , and he told her the whole story ! You know how she can get anyone to talk . She told me he was this big handsome fellow , but her eyesight is n’t what it used to be , bless the poor dear . Then I saw him just moments ago , and my word ! He is n’t simply big — he ’s gargantuan ! ”

5997	6000	5990	5990	She	432	“ Commotion ? ”

6147	6152	6153	6153	She	432	“ Oh , lovely ! ”
6163	6199	6153	6153	She	432	“ I have n’t had that in ages . It reminds me of the time I played Lady Macbeth at the Piccadilly and I met this strapping stagehand who was studying to be a chef — ”
6200	6209	6210	6210	I	94	“ I ’ll see you in an hour , ”
6226	6234	6153	6153	She	432	“ All right , Ducky ! Ta ! ”

6797	6831	6782	6782	I	94	“ That ’s the second time I ’ve left you speechless , lass . Imagine what would happen if I dropped the towel . I ’d probably have to call you an ambulance . ”
6901	6927	6888	6888	I	94	“ Can you please turn down that music ? It ’s very loud , and I had to listen to it all night last night — ”
6953	6962	6950	6950	I	94	“ Can you please turn down the music ? ”
6995	7001	6964	6964	he	366	“ What ’s that smell ? ”
7024	7029	7030	7030	I	94	“ Shepherd ’s pie ! ”
7036	7041	7030	7030	I	94	“ Can you please — ”
7063	7066	7067	7067	I	94	“ Hey ! ”
7186	7197	7198	7198	I	94	“ Hey ! What the heck is wrong with you ? ”

7239	7255	7257	7257	he	366	“ In case you could n’t tell , I just got out of the shower . ”
7300	7328	7329	7329	He	366	“ Could you please leave now ? And keep the music to a dull roar ? Other people live in this building besides you , you know . ”
7371	7391	7400	7400	He	366	“ You ’re not gon na invite me over for dinner ? I could help you fold your laundry . ”

7477	7485	7474	7474	he	88	“ And you are . . . ? ”
7486	7498	7474	7474	he	88	“ Joellen . Nice to meet you . Good - bye . ”
7505	7519	7499	7499	He	88	“ What , you do n’t want to introduce me to your boyfriend ? ”
7520	7549	7474	7474	he	88	“ What I want is to finish my dinner and not have a wet , half - naked stranger with more muscles than manners standing in my kitchen . ”
7567	7583	7550	7550	Cameron	366	“ So you ’ve noticed my muscles . And you do n’t have a boyfriend . ”
7689	7696	7697	7697	I	94	“ If you ’ll excuse me , ”
7701	7716	7697	7697	I	94	“ I have a dinner date . You ’re making me late for it . ”
7717	7720	7721	7721	He	366	“ Oh . ”

8497	8535	8487	8487	I	94	“ We should n’t have to deal with this idiot and his music and parties and loud vertical hookups ! I work for a living ! I pay my bills ! I should n’t be subjected to — ”
8555	8560	8547	8547	Someone	325	“ Who is it ? ”
8569	8589	8547	8547	Someone	325	“ Stop spyin ’ on me , you little Peepin ’ Tom , or I ’ll call the super ! ”
8624	8642	8621	8621	I	94	“ I ’m going to call the super because you ’re loud , obnoxious , and rude ! ”

8778	8781	8782	8782	he	484	“ Prance ? ”
8789	8796	8782	8782	he	484	“ Cameron McGregor does not prance . ”
8797	8813	8748	8748	I	94	“ — people would n’t have to be subjected to the sight of your body — ”
8814	8823	8782	8782	he	484	“ You make it sound like a punishment . ”
8824	8841	8748	8748	I	94	“ — accosted in their own homes while they ’re trying to mind their own business — ”
8842	8854	8782	8782	he	484	“ When I know for a fact you actually enjoy it . ”
8860	8864	8855	8855	My	94	“ Excuse me ? ”
8868	8881	8865	8865	He	484	“ You heard me . I know when a woman wants me . ”
8903	8939	8899	8899	I	94	“ For your information , you ’re the last man on the planet I ’d ever be attracted to . In spite of your obviously overinflated opinion of yourself , you ’re not my type . ”
8940	8945	8885	8885	he	484	“ Oh , really ? ”
8966	8989	8958	8958	he	484	“ Then why ’re you always starin ’ at me like I ’m lunch and lookin ’ at me through your peephole ? ”
8990	8995	8996	8996	I	94	“ You ’re insane , ”
9016	9055	9000	9000	He	484	“ It goes dark when your head ’s there , blockin ’ the light . I ’d say you stared at me for a good five minutes while I was warmin ’ up this mornin ’ , lass . ”
9097	9110	9117	9117	he	484	“ Cam , get back in here ! We ’re not finished ! ”

9140	9147	9148	9148	He	484	“ Wow . What a gentleman . ”
9151	9179	9148	9148	He	484	“ She knew the deal . You do n’t go home with a stranger after one drink if you ’re interested in a long - term relationship . ”
9189	9231	9180	9181	This guy	489	“ Okay , number one ? You ’re disgusting . Number two ? This conversation is over . Number three ? If you keep up the noise , I ’m not only calling the super , I ’m calling the cops . ”
9246	9265	9232	9232	He	484	“ You ’re tense . Guess your date did n’t go as well as mine did , eh ? ”
9286	9294	9295	9295	I	94	“ It ’s been real , McGregor . ”

9348	9373	9318	9318	he	484	“ Bake me one of your shepherd ’s pies , and I ’ll be quiet as a mouse . Your pie for my silence . ”
9382	9399	9318	9318	he	484	“ Pie . I get it . Hilarious . What are you , ten years old ? ”
9473	9486	9458	9459	Mr. Bingley	370	“ Ugh . Men . Everything you are is between your legs ! ”

9576	9605	9543	9543	he	370	“ Denny , it ’s eight o’clock on Sunday morning , and I have n’t had my coffee yet . I ’m not mentally prepared for fart jokes . ”
9802	9815	9773	9773	I	94	“ What do you get when you eat refried beans and onions ? ”
9825	9834	9816	9816	I	94	“ Denny . For the love of God . ”
9835	9839	9816	9816	I	94	“ Tear gas ! ”
9870	9889	9816	9816	I	94	“ Why do n’t little girls fart ? Because they do n’t have assholes until they ’re married ! ”
9890	9900	9901	9901	I	94	“ Okay , that one ’s a little funny , ”
9918	9932	9816	9816	I	94	“ Yeah , that ’s one of my wife ’s favorites , too . ”
10161	10164	10165	10165	he	370	“ Oh , ”
10188	10216	10185	10185	I	94	“ I . . . I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean t - to disturb you . I just . . . just . . . ”

10753	10763	10747	10747	Michael	370	“ I hope your Saturday was better than mine . ”
10823	10834	10818	10818	Michael	370	“ Well , I ’ll let you get to it . ”

10912	10924	10925	10925	I	94	“ I meant , yes , I ’m out of sorts . ”
10964	11011	10925	10925	I	94	“ I have n’t been sleeping well the last few nights . I have a new neighbor who ’s apparently trying to turn the rest of us in the building deaf with his music . I did n’t realize stereos could be used as torture devices . ”
11039	11048	10925	10925	I	94	“ I had a neighbor like that once . ”
11080	11086	11091	11091	his	370	“ What did you do ? ”
11116	11137	11091	11091	his	370	“ I went over to his house , explained that he was disturbing me , and asked him to stop . ”
11138	11143	11091	11091	his	370	“ And that worked ? ”
11144	11160	11161	11161	He	370	“ No , that actually made it worse . So then I beat him up . ”
11168	11189	11161	11161	He	370	“ I ’m kidding . I made a noise complaint to the police , and they took care of it . ”
11226	11235	11237	11237	Michael	370	“ That ’s probably what you should do , ”
11275	11286	11302	11302	I	94	“ You ’re right . I know you ’re right . ”
11308	11351	11302	11302	I	94	“ But he lives right across the hall from me , and I would n’t want to have to see him after that . He ’d know it was me who snitched on him because I ’ve already confronted him about it . ”
11363	11379	11359	11359	Michael	370	“ Are you worried he ’ll retaliate ? Is this guy some kind of thug ? ”
11433	11451	11425	11425	My	94	“ Well , he is a rugby player ! Who knows what the guy is capable of ! ”
11480	11517	11463	11463	Michael	370	“ Good God , you live next to a rugby man ? That ’s like living next to a silverback gorilla ! Definitely do n’t confront him again , Joellen . Let the authorities handle it . ”
11518	11521	11463	11463	Michael	370	“ Really ? ”
11526	11572	11522	11522	He	370	“ Believe me , I had my share of run - ins with the daft buggers when I was at Oxford . They ’re animals . Animals who ’re in love with themselves . Rugby players take the term egomaniac to a whole new level . ”
11582	11594	11573	11573	I	94	“ Yeah , that basically describes Cameron McGregor in a nutshell . ”
11601	11608	11595	11595	Michael	370	“ Your neighbor is Cameron McGregor ? ”
11616	11621	11611	11611	he	370	“ Um , yes ? ”
11622	11640	11611	11611	he	370	“ The captain of the Scotland national union team , the Red Devils ? That Cameron McGregor ? ”
11641	11654	11611	11611	he	370	“ Honestly , I have no idea what team he plays for — ”
11655	11673	11611	11611	he	370	“ Six foot six , messy brown hair , built like a skyscraper , covered in tattoos ? ”
11674	11682	11611	11611	he	370	“ That sounds like him , yes . ”
11688	11697	11683	11683	Michael	370	“ Christ . You might want to move . ”
11702	11710	11698	11698	My	94	“ Oh God . That sounds bad . ”
11711	11784	11785	11785	Michael	370	“ I do n’t know how closely you follow sports , but your neighbor is all over the papers , and usually not for his performance on the pitch . Bar fights , sex scandals , being drunk and disorderly in public . . . McGregor ’s temper is almost as notorious as his women . The UK gossip rags call him Prince Pantydropper because of the sheer number of his conquests . ”
11834	11854	11855	11855	I	94	“ He ’s well on his way to earning that title on this side of the pond , too , ”
11905	11919	11898	11898	I	94	“ I hope I do n’t run into him in the hallway again . ”
11920	11928	11929	11929	Michael	370	“ Steer clear of him , Joellen . ”
12007	12021	12002	12002	Michael	370	“ Your cheeks just turned bright red . Are you feeling all right ? ”
12022	12028	12029	12029	I	94	“ Yep . Peachy keen , ”
12069	12084	12086	12086	he	370	“ Did I say something wrong ? I hope I have n’t offended you . ”
12153	12170	12150	12150	I	94	“ Nothing you say could ever be offensive to me . I ’m just . . . ”
12171	12176	12150	12150	I	94	“ Out of sorts . ”
12235	12240	12241	12241	I	94	“ Yes . Exactly . ”
12247	12252	12241	12241	I	94	“ Out of sorts . ”
12253	12258	12259	12259	His	370	“ We both are . ”
12289	12300	12286	12286	he	370	“ I wish my only problem were a noisy neighbor . ”
12341	12349	12364	12364	he	370	“ Is everything . . . okay ? ”
12378	12384	12350	12350	He	370	“ I ’m getting divorced . ”
12385	12388	12389	12389	I	94	“ Oh ! ”
12397	12405	12389	12389	I	94	“ Michael , I ’m so sorry ! ”
12490	12494	12495	12495	he	94	“ Thank you , ”
12499	12517	12495	12495	he	94	“ Though it was n’t exactly unexpected . We ’ve been having problems for years . . . ”
12556	12584	12541	12541	he	94	“ I ’m sorry . I do n’t know why I told you that . Nobody else knows . We have n’t even told our families yet . ”
12609	12623	12600	12600	I	94	“ You have my word I wo n’t say a thing to anyone . ”
12640	12652	12600	12600	I	94	“ I ’m just so sorry this is happening to you . ”
12668	12680	12653	12653	Michael	370	“ Thank you , Joellen . You ’re always so nice . ”
12733	12745	12704	12704	Michael	370	“ So , are you coming to the office holiday party ? ”
12942	12945	12946	12946	I	94	“ Yes . ”
12955	12962	12946	12946	I	94	“ I ’ll definitely be there . ”
12963	12973	12937	12937	he	370	“ Good . Will you save me a dance ? ”
13013	13016	13017	13017	I	94	“ Sure , ”
13178	13180	13186	13186	I	94	“ goddess ”
13388	13396	13397	13397	Gah	106	“ Where ’s my pie , lass ? ”
13419	13442	13407	13407	I	94	“ As you can see , I literally just got home . I do n’t have a magical pie - producing handbag . ”
13443	13464	13401	13401	him	106	“ Excuses , excuses ! Next you ’ll be tellin ’ me they ran out of food at the store ! ”
13489	13523	13524	13524	I	94	“ Some people have to work for a living , okay ? I have n’t had a chance to go to the grocery store to get the stuff for your dang . . . ”
13565	13574	13554	13554	he	366	“ Are you wearing . . . tights ? ”
13575	13580	13581	13581	He	366	“ What , these ? ”
13654	13662	13663	13663	he	366	“ Eyes up top , darlin ’ , ”
13720	13731	13734	13734	his	366	“ Now , now , no need to be shy . ”
13737	13767	13734	13734	his	366	“ I already know how bad you ’ve got it for me , lass . And no , these are n’t tights . They ’re runner ’s compression leggings . ”
13778	13787	13788	13788	I	94	“ Please get your hand off my door . ”
13818	13847	13854	13854	his	94	“ I ’ll get my hand off your door when you tell me what time supper is . I really want that pie of yours , darlin ’ . ”
13877	13899	13864	13864	he	94	“ Do n’t call me darling ! And stop talking about my shepherd ’s pie like it ’s my pie pie ! ”
13912	13917	13918	13918	He	94	“ Your pie pie ? ”
13928	13954	13918	13918	He	94	“ I have no idea what you mean . I ’m just tryin ’ to find out when I can expect somethin’ you promised me . ”
13969	13980	13964	13964	He	94	“ You see ? I ’m starvin ’ , lass ! ”
14009	14014	13982	13982	he	94	“ Rr - ow ! ”
14049	14056	14057	14057	Cam	366	“ Who do we have here ? ”
14095	14101	14081	14081	he	94	“ That ’s Mr. Bingley . ”
14178	14198	14170	14170	Cam	366	“ You must ’ve done something really bad to get yourself named after a Jane Austen character , mate . ”
14228	14231	14233	14233	Cam	366	“ What ? ”
14244	14258	14233	14233	Cam	366	“ You thought I was all beauty and no brains , darlin ’ ? ”
14265	14274	14259	14259	I	94	“ More like all ego and no manners . ”
14291	14304	14275	14275	He	366	“ So you ’re not denyin ’ you think I ’m beautiful . ”
14311	14330	14305	14305	My	94	“ You ’re depriving some poor village of its idiot . Can I have my cat back now ? ”
14331	14343	14344	14344	He	366	“ When I get my pie , you get the cat . ”
14371	14374	14377	14377	I	94	“ McGregor ! ”
14386	14396	14377	14377	I	94	“ Give me my cat back right this minute ! ”
14415	14424	14377	14377	I	94	“ Your pie for your pussy , sweetheart . ”
14554	14576	14545	14545	I	94	“ If he comes back with a single hair out of place , I ’ll kick your tights - wearing butt ! ”
14799	14807	14808	14808	I	94	“ I ’m going to kill him , ”
14814	14835	14808	14808	I	94	“ If Mr. Bingley is even a little miffed when he comes home , Cameron McGregor is going to die . ”
14917	14922	14923	14923	I	94	“ Where is he ? ”
14938	14944	14988	14988	He	1758	“ Where ’s my pie ? ”
14945	14950	14988	14988	He	1758	“ In the oven . ”
14960	14987	14988	14988	He	1758	“ It has to bake ! It takes time ! You ’ll have your stupid shepherd ’s pie in half an hour for God ’s sake ! ”
14995	15006	14988	14988	He	1758	“ So that ’s when you ’ll have your cat . ”
15090	15097	15098	15098	I	94	“ Mr. Bingley ! Mr. Bing — ”
15135	15145	15146	15146	Cameron	366	“ He ’s a real lover , that one . ”
15167	15203	15160	15160	he	366	“ Practically had to peel him off me so I could take a shower . Never had a cat take a likin ’ to me so fast . Takes after his mum , I guess . ”
15262	15296	15257	15257	He	366	“ Now I know you do n’t think you ’re leavin ’ with that cat , lass , seein ’ as how I do n’t have a shepherd ’s pie in my hands . ”
15297	15311	15257	15257	He	366	“ Your obsession with that particular food is pathological , you know that ? ”
15312	15329	15330	15330	He	366	“ It ’s just that . . . pie is my favorite thing in the world . ”
15345	15359	15360	15360	He	366	“ Ugh . Keep talking — maybe someday you ’ll say something intelligent . ”
15396	15401	15402	15402	he	366	“ Okay , comedian , ”
15408	15430	15402	15402	he	366	“ New deal . We ’re goin’ over to your place while we wait for my pie to finish bakin ’ . ”
15517	15522	15523	15523	I	94	“ You ’re unbelievable . ”
15575	15584	15587	15587	Cameron	366	“ Ducky ? Ducky , are you home ? ”
15592	15595	15587	15587	Cameron	366	“ Ducky ? ”
15596	15603	15604	15604	I	94	“ Shut up , pie boy , ”
15654	15661	15662	15662	She	1817	“ There you are , dear ! ”
15680	15686	15687	15687	She	1817	“ Hello , Mrs. Dinwiddle . ”
15707	15741	15687	15687	She	1817	“ I just wanted to say that last night was lovely . I probably do n’t tell you enough , but I so appreciate you making dinner for me every Satur . . . ”
15791	15800	15785	15785	she	1817	“ Why , hellooo there , young man . ”
15850	15866	15845	15846	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ I did n’t think you ’d have company , Ducky . You never have — ”
15867	15873	15874	15874	I	94	“ He was just leaving , ”
15893	15900	15901	15901	Cameron	366	“ No , I was n’t . ”
15933	15935	15936	15936	I	94	“ date ”
15943	15956	15957	15957	He	366	“ Hullo , I ’m Cameron McGregor . Pleasure to meet you . ”
16056	16063	16064	16064	she	1817	“ Well are n’t you dashing ? ”
16082	16110	16071	16071	Cameron	366	“ I do n’t know about that , ma’am , but I do know that a beautiful woman like yourself should always be treated like a queen . ”
16114	16126	16111	16111	I	94	“ And the ugly ones should always be treated like servants ? ”
16136	16154	16131	16132	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ He ’s only paying me a little compliment , Ducky . Leave the poor man alone ! ”
16155	16166	16167	16167	I	94	“ Oh , I ’d love to leave him alone , ”
16170	16179	16167	16167	I	94	“ All alone . On a desert island . ”
16190	16202	16187	16187	Cam	366	“ She ’s just jealous of your style , Mrs. Dinwiddle . ”
16203	16217	16218	16218	Cam	366	“ No , I ’m jealous of everyone who has n’t met you . ”
16229	16260	16218	16218	Cam	366	“ Oh , c’m on now , lass , meetin ’ me has got ta be the most excitin ’ thing to happen to you since your last Pap smear . ”
16290	16293	16294	16294	I	94	“ Ha , ”
16298	16311	16294	16294	I	94	“ You have all the charm of an open grave , McGregor . ”
16312	16326	16327	16327	He	366	“ Tch . Just admit it . You ’re in love with me . ”
16346	16369	16370	16370	Cam	366	“ Love ? Hardly . If you were on a life support machine , I ’d unplug it to charge my phone . ”
16410	16434	16404	16405	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ I ’m sure she would fall in love with you , Cameron , but she ’s already in love with someone else . ”
16435	16445	16447	16447	Cam	366	“ That so ? Who ’s the lucky man ? ”
16498	16514	16489	16489	she	1817	“ No one ! She ’s kidding . I ’m not in love with any — ”
16515	16520	16521	16523	crows Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Her married boss ! ”
16614	16631	16601	16601	He	366	“ You ’re having an affair with your married boss ? And you ’re judging me ? ”
16632	16641	16642	16642	I	94	“ I am certainly not having an affair ! ”
16647	16656	16642	16642	I	94	“ I ’d never do such a thing ! ”
16662	16673	16657	16658	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ He does n’t know she exists , you see . ”
16674	16691	16692	16692	I	94	“ Okay , visiting time at the zoo is over . Good - bye , people . ”
16726	16735	16736	16736	Cam	366	“ Hold on . Explain this to me . ”
16744	16777	16736	16736	Cam	366	“ So you ’re in love with this guy — who ’s married — but you ’ve never gotten together with him . . . because he does n’t know you exist ? ”
16785	16807	16778	16778	I	94	“ You make it sound like the only reason I have n’t committed adultery is because he has n’t noticed me . ”
16808	16824	16827	16828	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ It ’s not adultery on your part if you ’re not married , Ducky , ”
16834	16836	16832	16840	a rather “ educated ” opinion on the matter	585	“ educated ”
16842	16900	16778	16778	I	94	“ Ugh . Semantics ! My point is that even if Michael were all over me , I ’d never do anything with a married man ! It ’s just . . . unrequited . He does n’t know how I feel about him . But even if he did , I ’d never cross that line . ”
16924	16949	16921	16921	he	366	“ That ’s a sad story , lass . No wonder you ’re always in such a bad mood every time I see you . ”
16950	16968	16969	16969	I	94	“ I ’m in a bad mood every time I see you because I ’m seeing you , ”
16973	16994	16969	16969	I	94	“ And it ’s not that sad a story , because I found out today that he ’s getting divorced . ”
17016	17032	17003	17003	I	94	“ And he asked me to save him a dance at the office holiday party . ”
17049	17054	17033	17033	Cam	366	“ The plot thickens ! ”
17064	17079	17055	17056	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Indeed ! Now will you let me give you that makeover , Ducky ? ”
17080	17093	17132	17132	Cam	366	“ Just out of curiosity , why do you call her Ducky ? ”
17109	17131	17094	17095	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Because she insists on remaining an ugly duckling , my dear , when she could so easily become a swan . ”
17150	17155	17132	17132	Cam	366	“ Aw . Ducky . ”
17299	17310	17311	17311	I	94	“ Stop staring at me — you’re freaking me out , ”
17335	17347	17436	17436	I	94	“ How long have you been in love with your boss ? ”
17348	17354	17441	17441	his	592	“ None of your business . ”
17355	17411	17436	17436	I	94	“ Oh , c’m on , you can tell me , lass . It ’s not like I ’ll ever meet the man . Besides , I go back to Scotland in a month when the new season starts , and you ’ll never have to see me again . Get it off your chest . ”
17427	17435	17412	17412	I	94	“ Why do you care , anyway ? ”
17447	17500	17436	17436	I	94	“ I do n’t really , but I guess I ca n’t understand why a woman would waste her time pinin ’ over a man who does n’t want her when she could be focusin ’ on findin ’ one who does . And — forgive me — especially at your age . ”
17509	17519	17501	17501	I	94	“ God , you sound exactly like my mother . ”
17534	17559	17520	17520	I	94	“ So you ’ve talked to your mother about this . Which means it ’s serious and has probably been going on for years . ”
17570	17581	17562	17562	I	94	“ How on earth would you know what it means ? ”
17582	17587	17605	17605	He	592	“ I know women . ”
17640	17656	17678	17678	He	592	“ Fine . Yes , it ’s serious and has been going on for years . ”
17657	17662	17678	17678	He	592	“ How many years ? ”
17668	17677	17663	17663	I	94	“ Are you writing a book or something ? ”
17681	17693	17678	17678	He	592	“ Just gettin ’ my facts straight . Answer the question . ”
17732	17757	17725	17725	I	94	“ Ten years . Since the first day I started working at my job . Since the first minute I laid eyes on him . ”
17809	17813	17814	17814	he	592	“ And what , ”
17822	17839	17814	17814	he	592	“ is so special about him that would make you flush a decade down the toilet ? ”
17863	17869	17851	17851	I	94	“ You would n’t understand . ”
17870	17885	17840	17840	I	94	“ Aye , I would , lass . I understand obsession all too well . ”
17979	17992	17993	17993	Cam	366	“ He ’s just . . . perfect . In every way . ”
18001	18010	17993	17993	Cam	366	“ Barf . Can you be more specific ? ”
18011	18026	17993	17993	Cam	366	“ He ’s educated . Cultured . Sophisticated . Kind . Brilliant . Gorgeous . ”
18027	18030	17993	17993	Cam	366	“ Gorgeous ? ”
18039	18096	18031	18031	I	94	“ He looks exactly like Christopher Reeve in his Superman days . Heroic . Cleft chin and everything . And he ’s a gentleman . His manners would put the queen of England to shame . And he dresses beautifully . And he knows all about literature , and opera , and ballet , and art — ”
18097	18103	17993	17993	Cam	366	“ So he ’s gay . ”
18128	18141	18117	18117	I	94	“ He ’s not gay ! He ’s been married for years ! ”
18142	18147	18031	18031	I	94	“ To a man ? ”
18148	18174	18117	18117	I	94	“ No ! To a model , if you must know — some airheaded Amazon with a thigh gap and a twenty - inch waist ! ”
18175	18178	18179	18179	He	366	“ Huh . ”
18190	18196	18179	18179	He	366	“ So he ’s superficial . ”
18197	18202	18117	18117	I	94	“ What ? No ! ”
18203	18214	18179	18179	He	366	“ Yes , he is . Just like you are . ”
18229	18236	18238	18238	Cam	366	“ Do n’t gimme that look , ”
18245	18265	18238	18238	Cam	366	“ You ’re in love with some bloke based on nothing more than his résumé and his pretty face . ”
18266	18272	18238	18238	Cam	366	“ That is not true ! ”
18308	18320	18301	18301	Cam	366	“ No ? How many conversations have you had with him ? ”
18321	18325	18332	18332	I	94	“ A lot ! ”
18342	18349	18350	18350	he	366	“ That do n’t involve work , ”
18370	18386	18353	18353	I	94	“ Forget it . Your pie ’s almost ready . Take it and get lost . ”
18387	18395	18401	18401	Cam	366	“ The answer ’s none , right ? ”
18413	18437	18438	18438	he	366	“ And how much time have you spent with this ‘ perfect ’ man away from work ? Or work - related functions ? ”
18453	18474	18447	18447	My	94	“ You do n’t have to spend years in private conversations with someone to know they ’re a good person . ”
18475	18540	18438	18438	he	366	“ No , but one date would be a good start . It seems to me you do n’t really know anything about him other than that he ’s pretty and has rich - boy tastes . Ballet , opera , art . . . sounds like things someone who was tryin ’ real hard to impress other people would put in a bio . ”
18636	18730	18631	18631	he	366	“ I ’ve worked at his company for ten years of my life . I ’ve seen how he treats people , how he speaks to them , how he interacts with his employees , vendors , and guests . He ’s an incredible man . An exceptional man . And yes , he ’s beautiful , but it would n’t matter if he were n’t because he ’s so good . He ’d never make someone feel small , or put them down for their beliefs , or heartlessly mock their feelings . ”
18766	18814	18731	18731	My	94	“ He ’d never have sex with a stranger he met in a bar and then throw her out like garbage ! He ’d never aggravate his neighbors with loud music , or wander around half - dressed like a psychopath , or steal someone ’s cat ! ”
18815	18834	18905	18905	I	94	“ But he would marry an airheaded model with a thigh gap and a twenty - inch waist . ”
18840	18858	18835	18835	I	94	“ Oh , you ’re saying you ’re above marrying a beautiful model , is that it ? ”
18859	18862	18863	18863	he	94	“ No , ”
18871	18904	18863	18863	he	94	“ I ’m sayin ’ if he were the altruistic , benevolent demigod you make him out to be , he ’d marry a woman who more closely reflected his true heart . ”
18925	18936	18905	18905	I	94	“ Rich men marry women for their beauty every day . ”
18937	18970	18905	18905	I	94	“ Aye , they do , and those rich men are the same superficial fuckers who dump those beautiful girls once their looks fade and swap them out for a younger replacement . ”
19092	19095	19075	19075	Cam	366	“ Here . ”
19128	19158	19075	19075	Cam	366	“ Here ’s your stupid shepherd ’s pie . Now go back to Kellen ’s apartment and leave me in peace with my pathetic one - sided love story . ”
19159	19168	19169	19169	His	366	“ Never said it was pathetic , lass . ”
19181	19207	19169	19169	His	366	“ But that ’s what you think . It ’s pretty obvious you think I ’m dumb as dirt for feeling the way I do . ”
19208	19216	19217	19217	Cam	366	“ The heart wants what it wants , ”
19224	19257	19217	19217	Cam	366	“ But sometimes what you think is love is just a beautiful form of self - destruction . The worst thing in life is to give yourself away in exchange for nothing . ”
19371	19389	19390	19390	I	94	“ Well , my life is mine , and what I do with it is my business , ”
19394	19422	19390	19390	I	94	“ Now please leave . I ’m exhausted . I worked all weekend , and I have to get up early to go back in the morning . ”
19518	19535	19497	19497	He	366	“ Tell you what , lass . I ’m gon na do you a huge favor . ”
19536	19561	19642	19646	The smug , grinning bastard	605	“ If the next words out of your mouth have anything to do with your penis , I will kill you where you stand . ”
19562	19581	19497	19497	He	366	“ Just hear me out before you go all doo - lally on me now , darlin ’ . ”
19595	19617	19592	19592	my	94	“ I do n’t know what doo - lally means , but what did I tell you about calling me darling ? ”
19618	19641	19642	19646	The smug , grinning bastard	605	“ You can tell what it means from the context . And I ’ll call you whatever I want . Darlin ’ . ”
19657	19679	19642	19646	The smug , grinning bastard	605	“ You make me feel violent , McGregor . I wish I were a man so I could kick your ass . ”
19688	19704	19680	19680	He	605	“ Cute . But there is n’t a man alive who could kick my arse . ”
19734	19760	19720	19720	I	94	“ Listen . While you were tellin ’ your sad story about your unrequited love for pretty boy Michael , a thought crossed my mind . ”
19761	19771	19772	19772	I	94	“ Must ’ve been a long and lonely journey , ”
19775	19785	19720	19720	I	94	“ I ’m gon na help you get him . ”
19821	19829	19800	19800	he	366	“ You ’re . . . what ? ”
19830	19841	19842	19842	He	366	“ I ’m an expert at two things , lass . ”
19861	19870	19842	19842	He	366	“ Rugby , and the art of seduction . ”
19879	19892	19877	19877	me	94	“ Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home ? ”
19893	19943	19842	19842	He	366	“ Stop insultin ’ me for a minute and listen . If you really want this bloke , you ’re gon na have to play your cards right . You ca n’t come at him too hot or too cold . It ’s like Goldilocks and the three bears . ”
19944	19952	19877	19877	me	94	“ Yeah , you lost me there . ”
19953	19974	19842	19842	He	366	“ The first bowl of porridge was too salty . That ’s you , by the way — very salty . ”
19982	19995	19877	19877	me	94	“ The second bowl of porridge was too sweet . Not you . ”
20006	20017	19996	19996	I	94	“ Just get on with the damn story , McGregor . ”
20018	20041	19877	19877	me	94	“ The third bowl of porridge was just right . That ’s what you have to be for him . Just right . ”
20077	20085	20074	20074	I	94	“ You ’re a profoundly strange person . ”
20086	20098	20074	20074	I	94	“ I can teach you how to be what he wants . ”
20099	20120	20074	20074	I	94	“ Pfft ! You do n’t even know him ! How could you possibly teach me to be what he — ”
20121	20132	20133	20133	he	366	“ I know men even better than I know women , ”
20140	20152	20133	20133	he	366	“ And I know exactly what makes pretty rich boys tick . ”
20162	20182	20156	20156	his	366	“ That sounds a little ominous . Is there a story of dubious sexual consent lurking behind that statement ? ”
20195	20231	20183	20183	He	366	“ Bein ’ in a fishbowl , living like I do , you ’re exposed to every kind of person there is . Over the years , I ’ve sorta become a student of humanity . ”
20245	20262	20232	20232	I	94	“ You ? A student of humanity ? The guy who prances around in yellow tights ? ”
20278	20299	20263	20263	He	366	“ You see ? You are superficial . You only look at what ’s right in front of your face . ”
20319	20332	20312	20312	I	94	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to be rude . ”
20333	20338	20339	20339	he	366	“ Aye , lass , ”
20343	20347	20339	20339	he	366	“ you did . ”
20352	20391	20349	20349	he	366	“ But I can take it because I ’m not your sensitive pretty boy lover , who ’d probably burst into tears if he got a gander at the dragon that hides under that unassuming exterior of yours . ”
20401	20415	20392	20392	My	94	“ Unassuming . That ’s a polite way of calling me a dog . ”
20424	20443	20416	20416	Cam	366	“ You ’re not a dog , darlin ’ . You ’re just not doin’ yourself any favors . ”
20444	20461	20416	20416	Cam	366	“ Jesus , between you and Mrs. Dinwiddle , my inferiority complex should reach new heights ! ”
20490	20501	20487	20487	He	366	“ You ’ve nothin’ to feel inferior about , idiot . ”
20502	20533	20416	20416	Cam	366	“ So we went from darling to idiot in the space of a few minutes . Excuse me while I go get my neck brace . I ’m getting whiplash . ”
20556	20586	20542	20542	He	366	“ Suit yourself . Do n’t take my help . But do n’t come cryin ’ to me when pretty boy keeps right on not knowin ’ you exist . ”
20587	20593	20542	20542	He	366	“ Stop calling him that ! ”
20594	20625	20542	20542	He	366	“ Stop pretending you ’re a mouse , dragon lady , and go after what you want . In fifty years , we ’ll all be dead . Carpe diem . ”
20790	20796	20775	20775	she	340	“ Good morning , Jillian ! ”
20834	20839	20843	20843	Joellen	126	“ Portia . Hi . ”
20942	20953	20928	20928	her	340	“ Have you finished the edit on Maria ’s manuscript ? ”
21034	21044	21045	21045	she	340	“ I understand you spoke with Michael this weekend , ”
21081	21102	21070	21070	he	370	“ Uh . . . I . . . yes . He was working , too . We said hello . ”
21110	21117	21118	21118	she	340	“ You said ‘ hello ’ ? ”
21154	21161	21141	21141	she	340	“ Um . . . yes . ”
21212	21215	21194	21194	she	340	“ Joanna . ”
21222	21243	21244	21244	Her	340	“ I ’m sure I do n’t have to remind you that we expect a certain level of . . . ”
21270	21277	21244	21244	Her	340	“ Professionalism here at Maddox Publishing . ”
21297	21309	21292	21292	I	94	“ You mean like calling the employees by their correct names ? ”
21357	21366	21348	21348	He	617	“ Is there a Joellen Bixby around here ? ”
21367	21371	21372	21372	Shasta	125	“ Right there . ”
21444	21457	21458	21458	He	620	“ Man , that sucker ’s heavy . Sign here , please . ”
21523	21531	21533	21533	Shasta	125	“ Well , who ’s it from ? ”
21595	21602	21604	21604	Shasta	125	“ So what does it say ? ”
21644	21654	21632	21632	Portia	340	“ Your pie is the most delicious . . . ”
21702	21715	21690	21690	I	94	“ If you ’ll excuse me , I have work to do . ”
21771	21774	21776	21776	Shasta	125	“ Dude , ”
21782	21787	21788	21788	She	340	“ That was awesome . ”
21795	21801	21788	21788	She	340	“ High five , bitch ! ”
21861	21866	21846	21846	I	94	“ Joellen Bixby speaking . ”
21867	21898	21825	21825	she	340	“ Wow , your professional - workin’-lady voice is hot . You ever think of goin’ into the phone - sex - operator field ? You ’d make a killing . ”
21899	21902	21846	21846	I	94	“ You ! ”
21914	21927	21846	21846	I	94	“ Aye , it ’s me , lass , your favorite neighbor . ”
21928	21932	21825	21825	she	340	“ The prancer . ”
21933	21956	21846	21846	I	94	“ Ha ! No , the exquisite physical specimen of a man you ’ve been ’ dreamin ’ about since we met . ”
21983	22001	21973	21973	I	94	“ Very funny . What do you want ? And how did you know where I work ? ”
22002	22014	21825	21825	she	340	“ I asked Mrs. Dinwiddle . Did you get the flowers ? ”
22031	22047	22015	22015	I	94	“ Yes . And your charming note . Shakespeare you ’re not , my friend . ”
22048	22058	21973	21973	I	94	“ Oh ho ! So we ’re friends now ! ”
22059	22078	22015	22015	I	94	“ No . I ’d still like to push you into traffic . Why ’re you calling me ? ”
22079	22089	21973	21973	I	94	“ To discuss phase one of Operation Pretty Boy . ”
22098	22108	22090	22090	I	94	“ Give me a slight break , would you ? ”
22116	22143	22109	22109	He	94	“ I ’ve already kicked things into gear with the flowers . If you ’re on his radar at all , that ’ll pique his interest . ”
22144	22159	22109	22109	He	94	“ Pique ? Did Cameron McGregor just use the word pique in a sentence ? ”
22163	22192	22160	22160	He	94	“ You ’ll be happy to know , darlin ’ , that Cameron McGregor has an exceptional vocabulary . Extraordinary , anomalous , remarkable , and preternaturally unprecedented . ”
22218	22250	22299	22299	He	94	“ . . . men are competitive by nature . If he likes you even a little , knowin ’ another man is sniffin ’ around will arouse his instinct for — ”
22251	22258	22299	22299	He	94	“ Sniffing around ? How romantic . ”
22259	22286	22299	22299	He	94	“ Quit bustin ’ my balls , lass . I ’m helpin ’ you get your heart ’s desire . A little gratitude would be nice . ”
22287	22298	22299	22299	He	94	“ I still do n’t understand why you ’re interested . ”
22311	22318	22299	22299	He	94	“ I ’ll tell you later . ”
22319	22326	22299	22299	He	94	“ Yikes . That sounds scary . ”
22327	22354	22299	22299	He	94	“ Maybe I just want you to keep givin ’ me that sweet , sweet pie of yours , lass . You ever think of that ? ”
22401	22426	22461	22461	He	94	“ It ’s too bad you got stuck in puberty , McGregor — you might ’ve been a productive member of society one day . ”
22427	22437	22461	22461	He	94	“ Oh , I ’m plenty productive , lass . ”
22438	22460	22461	22461	He	94	“ Name one way you ’re productive that does n’t involve the amount of sperm you produce . I ’ll wait . ”
22494	22508	22482	22482	he	94	“ Ach , you ’re a hoora salty lassie . Pure dead brilliant . ”
22509	22516	22461	22461	He	94	“ Thank you . I think . ”
22517	22525	22482	22482	he	94	“ Now listen , this is important . ”
22530	22538	22526	22526	I	94	“ I can hardly stand the anticipation . ”
22539	22592	22526	22526	I	94	“ When pretty boy asks you who gave you the flowers , just give him a little Mona Lisa smile and shrug . Do n’t answer . Be coy as shit . If you ca n’t manage it , pretend you ’re Mrs. Dinwiddle and do whatever you think she ’d do . ”
22593	22628	22526	22526	I	94	“ I do n’t have a mink coat and a silk fan handy . A girl needs props to make that kind of Scarlett O’Hara routine work . He ’ll think I ’m lame ! ”
22632	22648	22629	22629	Cam	366	“ He ’ll think you ’re mysterious . The less you say , the better . ”
22649	22671	22629	22629	Cam	366	“ Ouch . I know I ’m awkward and weird , McGregor . You do n’t have to rub it in . ”
22689	22736	22681	22681	Cameron	366	“ I do n’t ever wanna hear you put yourself down again , Joellen . Do n’t do it out loud , and do n’t do it in your head , either . Show yourself some damn respect , woman , or no one else will . ”
22782	22785	22786	22786	he	366	“ Understood ? ”
22789	22796	22780	22780	Grr	86	“ Yes . Fine . Okay . ”
22797	22809	22780	22780	Grr	86	“ Good . Now get back to work . And Joellen ? ”
22823	22826	22810	22810	He	366	“ What ? ”
22839	22854	22832	22832	He	366	“ You ’re not weird . You ’re unique . There ’s a difference . ”
22903	22911	22888	22888	Denny	71	“ Hey , kiddo ! Special delivery ! ”
22928	22936	22912	22912	Shasta	125	“ Another delivery ? What is it ? ”
22948	22968	22939	22940	this girl	625	“ I wish I could tell you , but unfortunately my X - ray vision is n’t working today . ”
23014	23035	23002	23002	He	71	“ It ’s a new chair for you , kiddo . Mr. Maddox put in a requisition over the weekend . ”
23081	23089	23091	23091	Shasta	125	“ That ’s the new ergonomic model , ”
23111	23121	23091	23091	Shasta	125	“ Oh , fantastic , you brought it up ! ”
23169	23192	23137	23137	Michael	370	“ Yes , sir ! You said first thing Monday , so I made sure to do it before my regular rounds . ”
23222	23226	23213	23213	Michael	370	“ first thing . ”
23321	23327	23347	23347	He	71	“ Good morning , Joellen . ”
23339	23346	23328	23328	I	94	“ Uh . . . morning . ”
23358	23364	23347	23347	He	71	“ Hi , Mr. Maddox ! ”
23365	23384	23347	23347	He	71	“ Good morning , Shasta . What a lovely sweater you ’re wearing . That color suits you . ”
23419	23429	23413	23413	she	125	“ Thank you . Blue ’s my favorite color . ”
23430	23435	23437	23437	Michael	370	“ Mine , too , ”
23479	23494	23468	23468	He	370	“ That ’s quite the enormous bouquet . Is it your birthday , Joellen ? ”
23530	23540	23522	23522	I	94	“ Oh , no , those are just from — ”
23572	23577	23569	23569	I	94	“ coy as shit , ”
23600	23604	23597	23597	I	94	“ A friend . ”
23726	23745	23719	23719	her	125	“ I guess it did n’t turn out to be such a bad weekend for you after all . ”
23770	23782	23783	23783	Denny	71	“ Let me get rid of this for you , kiddo . ”
23812	23817	23802	23802	He	71	“ Ta - da ! ”
23818	23834	23802	23802	He	71	“ Thank you . That ’s great . It looks very . . . ergonomic . ”
23954	23970	23946	23946	he	71	“ Did I tell you the one about Bill Gates farting in the Apple store ? ”
23971	23982	23983	23983	Michael	370	“ That will be all , Denny , thank you . ”
24020	24038	24017	24017	Denny	71	“ Oh yes , of course . Sorry , Mr. Maddox . I ’ll be off now . ”
24093	24106	24140	24140	his	366	“ Um , thanks for the chair . I really appreciate it . ”
24107	24137	24140	24140	his	366	“ You ’re welcome . Let me know if there ’s anything else you need , Joellen . I want to make sure you ’re well taken care of . ”
24208	24222	24197	24197	Michael	370	“ Well . I ’m back to work . Have a good day . ”
24260	24274	24253	24253	Shasta	125	“ Did someone drug my coffee , or was he flirting with you ? ”
24307	24315	24295	24295	she	125	“ Pinch me . I ’m dreaming . ”
24323	24352	24318	24318	Shasta	125	“ Bitch , I ’ll do more than pinch you . If Michael Maddox has the hots for you , I ’ll punch you right in the face . ”
24504	24535	24483	24483	he	642	“ Cool skirt , prancer . You look groovy in plaid . When ’re you going to invest in some shirts ? You do realize it ’s winter , right ? ”
24554	24562	24536	24536	He	642	“ It ’s a kilt , lass . ”
24592	24598	24536	24536	He	642	“ What ’s the difference ? ”
24599	24605	24644	24644	He	642	“ What you wear underneath . ”
24615	24625	24612	24612	he	642	“ Ask me what I ’m wearin ’ underneath . ”
24626	24643	24536	24536	He	642	“ I feel like this is a trick to get me to look at your junk . ”
24648	24673	24644	24644	He	642	“ My ‘ junk ’ ? Cameron McGregor does n’t have ‘ junk . ’ He has family jewels , thank you very much . ”
24688	24725	24674	24674	I	94	“ Yeah , well your family jewels can stay safely under your skirt , buddy , because I ’m in too good a mood to deal with a random penis sighting , thank you very much . ”
24743	24762	24726	24726	He	642	“ You sure ? It ’s a life - changin ’ event , I promise you , lass . ”
24766	24794	24763	24763	I	94	“ No doubt , but I do n’t have the cash to bankroll the long and expensive relationship with a psychotherapist that seeing you naked would necessitate . ”
24795	24806	24726	24726	He	642	“ Aha ! You admit it would blow your mind ! ”
24807	24835	24763	24763	I	94	“ I admit that I ’ve seen people like you before , but I ’ve had to pay an entry fee at the circus to do so . ”
24847	24880	24836	24836	He	642	“ Just make it easier on yourself , darlin ’ , and admit you ’re wild for me and are dyin ’ to bring a few dozen little McGregors into the world . ”
24881	24886	24726	24726	He	642	“ You ’re delusional . ”
24887	24896	24836	24836	He	642	“ You ’re massively in love with me . ”
24897	24906	24726	24726	He	642	“ I ’m massively in dislike with you . ”
24907	24922	24836	24836	He	642	“ You ’ve finally figured out I ’m the real man of your dreams . ”
24923	24941	24726	24726	He	642	“ I ’ve finally figured out how you got here . Someone left your cage door open . ”
24964	24984	24726	24726	He	642	“ You look awful cheery , lass . Did your lingerie store have a sale on beige granny panties ? ”
24998	25017	24994	24994	my	94	“ I just wanted to tell you that you ’re a genius . I think the roses worked . ”
25054	25060	25032	25032	He	366	“ Aye ? What happened ? ”
25067	25087	25061	25061	I	94	“ Whoa . Your ability to go from harmless flirt to serial killer is mutant , you know that ? ”
25088	25099	25061	25061	I	94	“ Do n’t kid yourself . I ’m never harmless . ”
25162	25211	25212	25212	He	366	“ Okeydokey . You ’re never harmless . Congratulations on being a psychopath . By the way , why ’s your music so loud ? You said , and I quote , ‘ Your pie for my silence . ’ That ear - splitting noise is hardly silence . ”
25249	25252	25253	25253	He	366	“ guns . ”
25267	25290	25229	25230	the man	366	“ That pie you made me yesterday bought my silence yesterday . You want more silence today ? I want another pie . ”
25296	25314	25291	25291	I	94	“ You never said that ! You ca n’t change the rules after we made an agreement ! ”
25315	25326	25327	25327	He	366	“ Cameron McGregor can do whatever he likes , lass . ”
25339	25342	25291	25291	I	94	“ Wait ! ”
25353	25368	25369	25369	He	366	“ I do n’t have the ingredients for another shepherd ’s pie , but — ”
25385	25406	25377	25377	I	94	“ But I can make you my grandmother ’s meat loaf , you big jerk ! It ’s even better ! ”
25431	25435	25424	25424	Cameron	366	“ Meat loaf ? ”
25436	25439	25440	25440	I	94	“ Yes , ”
25445	25461	25440	25440	I	94	“ Meat loaf . A loaf made of meat . It ’s friggin ’ delicious . ”
25468	25474	25475	25475	he	366	“ What kind of meat ? ”
25487	25491	25475	25475	he	366	“ Ground turkey . ”
25526	25553	25554	25554	He	366	“ It ’s fluffy , juicy , and comes with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy . Do you want the dang thing or not ? ”
25579	25583	25584	25584	He	366	“ All right . ”
25588	25618	25584	25584	He	366	“ I accept this loaf of meat you offer . But if I discover that you ’ve exaggerated its claims of greatness , our deal is null and void . ”
25633	25642	25643	25643	I	94	“ I ’ll show you null and void , ”
25721	25731	25704	25704	he	366	“ No , McGregor . No . Get out . ”
25771	25791	25746	25746	He	366	“ You can tell me all about pretty boy Michael and what a genius I am while you cook . ”
25856	25870	25871	25871	he	366	“ If looks could kill , I ’d be stone dead , lass , ”
25906	25917	25900	25900	I	94	“ You ’re the reason God created the middle finger . ”
25969	25979	25980	25980	He	366	“ I ’m happy you find me so amusing . ”
25985	25996	25980	25980	He	366	“ That ’s not exactly the word I ’d use . ”
26020	26036	26009	26009	I	94	“ You know , I was in a really good mood before I got home . ”
26037	26051	25980	25980	He	366	“ Because my roses worked . By the way , you ’re welcome . ”
26075	26096	26070	26070	he	366	“ Well . . . yes . And thank you . How much do I owe you for that bouquet ? ”
26097	26121	26009	26009	I	94	“ A week of shepherd ’s pies . And / or loafs of meat , if this one turns out to be acceptable . ”
26136	26166	26122	26122	He	366	“ It ’s a drop in the ocean compared to what a Manhattan florist charges for one hundred roses , darlin ’ . But it ’s up to you . ”
26232	26247	26225	26225	he	366	“ That includes no music for a week , too , though , right ? ”
26248	26261	26273	26273	He	366	“ Sure . But it also includes me eatin ’ over here . ”
26266	26272	26262	26262	I	94	“ Here ? Why here ? ”
26287	26293	26273	26273	He	366	“ I like your cat . ”
26309	26326	26303	26304	Mr. Bingley	370	“ Wo n’t that interfere with your naked poker parties and standing door sex with strangers ? ”
26333	26346	26330	26330	his	366	“ No , I ’ll just move those to the mornin ’s . ”
26375	26406	26363	26363	I	94	“ So to clarify , the deal is seven home - cooked meals , which you eat here , in exchange for payment on the roses and no loud music . ”
26420	26426	26407	26407	He	366	“ And that ’s it ? ”
26427	26444	26407	26407	He	366	“ I can throw in a daily viewin ’ of the family jewels if you like . ”
26466	26494	26454	26454	I	94	“ No , thank you . But it occurs to me that we should discuss exactly how long it will take you to eat your meals here . ”
26500	26516	26495	26495	He	366	“ You want a time limit , lass ? That ’s a trifle insultin ’ . ”
26517	26534	26445	26445	His	366	“ I just want to make sure you do n’t end up sleeping on my couch . ”
26535	26543	26495	26495	He	366	“ What if you invite me to ? ”
26552	26557	26495	26495	He	366	“ McGregor , honestly ! ”
26558	26608	26445	26445	His	366	“ It ’s a legitimate question . I ’ve been told I ’m irresistible often enough to believe it . You could very well wind up throwin ’ yourself at me , darlin ’ , and then where would we be ? Just clarifyin ’ , like you said . ”
26646	26652	26643	26643	I	94	“ Twenty minutes a night . ”
26659	26689	26643	26643	I	94	“ I ’m not a competitive eater , lass , you ca n’t expect me to shovel an entire pie down my throat in less than half an hour . ”
26690	26696	26643	26643	I	94	“ Fine . Thirty minutes . ”
26697	26701	26643	26643	I	94	“ One hour . ”
26702	26708	26643	26643	I	94	“ Forty - five minutes . ”
26737	26745	26709	26709	He	366	“ Forty - five minutes . Deal . ”
26760	26778	26746	26746	I	94	“ Deal . Now sit there , and try not to be annoying while I make dinner . ”
26847	26862	26837	26837	Cameron	366	“ Jesus ! You scared me half to death ! What ’re you doing ? ”
26863	26880	26881	26881	He	366	“ Did you forget I was here , lass ? Is your attention span that short ? ”
26922	26938	26903	26903	I	94	“ Get over there ! Go sit down at the table , and stop looming ! ”
26939	26946	26947	26947	he	366	“ Christ , you ’re bossy , ”
27036	27043	27031	27031	him	366	“ Can you please cover yourself ? ”
27044	27048	27049	27049	He	366	“ With this ? ”
27075	27089	27072	27072	he	366	“ Is the sight of my manly bare chest distracting you , sweetheart ? ”
27097	27112	27090	27090	I	94	“ Forty - five minutes of this every night and I ’ll go insane . ”
27113	27119	27090	27090	I	94	“ Aye . With lust . ”
27120	27127	27090	27090	I	94	“ Oh . My . God . ”
27128	27151	27090	27090	I	94	“ You can just call me Cam , darlin ’ . Though it ’s accurate , God seems a wee bit formal . ”
27194	27203	27191	27191	he	366	“ So . Pretty boy . Tell me . ”
27255	27286	27251	27251	Cam	366	“ It was brilliant . He came over first thing in the morning to see about the chair he ordered me , and there ’s this huge bouquet on my — ”
27287	27291	27327	27327	Cam	366	“ What chair ? ”
27302	27324	27292	27292	I	94	“ Oh . He thought my office chair was broken because I was being my usual clumsy self and . . . ”
27341	27357	27332	27332	I	94	“ I mean , he thought my chair was broken and ordered me another one . ”
27358	27367	27251	27251	Cam	366	“ This was before he saw the roses ? ”
27368	27392	27332	27332	I	94	“ Yeah . This was during the conversation I had with him on Sunday , when I found out he was getting divorced . ”
27393	27414	27251	27251	Cam	366	“ When you say he thought it was broken , that makes it sound like it was n’t actually broken . ”
27415	27456	27332	27332	I	94	“ It was n’t . It ’s hard to explain without getting you mad , because I ’ll have to describe what happened , and honestly I do n’t see any way around that without mentioning that I ’m clumsy . ”
27463	27466	27457	27457	Cam	366	“ Huh . ”
27467	27476	27519	27519	Cam	366	“ What d’you mean , ‘ huh ’ ? ”
27477	27485	27457	27457	Cam	366	“ There ’s two parts to it . ”
27486	27498	27519	27519	Cam	366	“ There ’s two parts to a one - syllable word ? ”
27499	27504	27457	27457	Cam	366	“ To the explanation . ”
27505	27518	27519	27519	Cam	366	“ Why do I feel like I should be sitting for this ? ”
27551	27569	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ Part one is the interestin ’ fact that pretty boy ordered you a new office chair . ”
27577	27583	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ Why is that interesting ? ”
27584	27643	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ Interestin ’ that he noticed . Interestin ’ that he took the initiative . Interestin ’ that he made it happen so fast . Interestin ’ that he dropped by to make sure it was done . All of it made even more interestin ’ because you ’re of the opinion he does n’t know you exist . ”
27652	27659	27644	27644	I	94	“ That ’s what I thought ! ”
27660	27671	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ What did he do when he saw the flowers ? ”
27672	27691	27644	27644	I	94	“ He sort of . . . glared at them , like he wanted to throw them away . ”
27705	27711	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ What ’s part two ? ”
27712	27728	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ That you care if I get mad when you ’re too hard on yourself . ”
27742	27753	27729	27729	I	94	“ So , what do you think it all means ? ”
27754	27763	27548	27548	Cam	366	“ I think it means he likes you . ”
27787	27801	27780	27780	I	94	“ Much as I ’d love to believe that , I ca n’t . ”
27802	27814	27837	27837	Cam	366	“ Maybe you should take my word for it , lass . ”
27815	27836	27780	27780	I	94	“ This from the man wearing nothing but a plaid skirt who insists I ’m desperate to have his babies . ”
27846	27870	27837	27837	Cam	366	“ Aye . And what bonny wee bairns they ’d be , too . Pretty little devils with their mum ’s salty tongue . ”
27871	27881	27837	27837	Cam	366	“ Being around you is slightly exhausting , McGregor . ”
27882	27897	27837	27837	Cam	366	“ Only slightly ? I ’m takin ’ that as a compliment , lass . ”
27955	27959	27960	27960	Cam	366	“ You see ? ”
27964	27981	27960	27960	Cam	366	“ You ’re mad about me . Only a woman in love can laugh like that . ”
27995	28012	27988	27988	I	94	“ You were dropped on your head a lot as a baby , were n’t you ? ”
28013	28019	28020	28020	he	366	“ Not as a baby , ”
28031	28036	28020	28020	he	366	“ That came later . ”
28097	28108	28109	28109	he	366	“ I can hear the gears turnin ’ , lass , ”
28116	28129	28109	28109	he	366	“ Do n’t break your brain — just go ahead and ask . ”
28130	28143	28109	28109	he	366	“ Um . Sheesh . I do n’t know where to start . ”
28152	28162	28148	28148	I	94	“ You . . . had a rough childhood ? ”
28168	28179	28163	28163	He	366	“ Do n’t tell me you have n’t googled me . ”
28180	28195	28163	28163	He	366	“ Of course I have n’t googled you ! Why would I do that ? ”
28196	28207	28163	28163	He	366	“ Because I ’m Cameron McGregor , that ’s why . ”
28268	28291	28261	28261	I	94	“ Okay , not to be mean , but I literally had never heard of you until you moved into my building . ”
28297	28309	28292	28292	He	366	“ Do n’t be daft . Everyone ’s heard of me . ”
28310	28319	28292	28292	He	366	“ Dude . You ’re not Mick Jagger . ”
28320	28333	28292	28292	He	366	“ No , I ’m much more famous and better - looking . ”
28334	28341	28292	28292	He	366	“ No , you ’re not . ”
28363	28385	28355	28355	He	366	“ You ’re saying you think Mick bloody Jagger , that grizzled old Englishman , is better - looking than me ? ”
28386	28412	28355	28355	He	366	“ Easy , tiger . Do n’t get your skirt in a bunch . I ’m saying you ’re not as famous as Mick Jagger . ”
28448	28467	28413	28413	He	366	“ You ’re sadly misinformed , darlin ’ . I ’m the most famous athlete on the planet . ”
28468	28498	28541	28541	His	366	“ Okay , number one , rock stars are more famous than athletes , hands down . And number two , you ’re not more famous than Michael Jordan . ”
28507	28517	28499	28499	He	366	“ I ’m way more famous than Michael Jordan ! ”
28518	28540	28413	28413	He	366	“ Maybe in your own mind , but here in the land of the sane people , you ’re definitely not . ”
28554	28567	28541	28541	His	366	“ Ach , lassie , you really do n’t get out enough . ”
28568	28610	28499	28499	He	366	“ On a side note to this stupid conversation , McGregor , here in the States , Lassie is a famous television dog . So when I hear you call me lassie , I ’m hearing you call me a dog . ”
28618	28624	28611	28611	He	366	“ What kind of dog ? ”
28625	28631	28499	28499	He	366	“ Oh , sweet Jesus . ”
28632	28669	28611	28611	He	366	“ I ’m bein ’ serious ! Is it a pretty dog ? A mangy dog ? A pit bull ? I ’ve never heard of this Lassie character . You need to clue me in . ”
28670	28702	28499	28499	He	366	“ You were kicked out of Scotland because you ’re so annoying , right ? Everyone got together and agreed to throw you out for the greater good of the country ? ”
28715	28724	28703	28703	He	366	“ You ’d know if you googled me . ”
28725	28734	28611	28611	He	366	“ I am not googling you , egosaurus . ”
28735	28751	28703	28703	He	366	“ C’m on , you know you want to . We can do it together ! ”
28761	28772	28752	28752	I	94	“ You have serious mental problems that require professional help . ”
28778	28795	28773	28773	His	366	“ All part o ’ my charm , sweetheart , all part o ’ my charm . ”
28838	28846	28830	28830	Cam	366	“ Oh , shut up , McGregor . ”
28847	28877	28878	28878	He	366	“ Never in a million years , lass . I ’ve got too many brilliant ideas to share . Like this one , for instance . Are you ready ? ”
28898	28904	28830	28830	Cam	366	“ I can hardly wait . ”
28905	28921	28830	28830	Cam	366	“ First , a question : When was the last time you kissed a man ? ”
28929	28933	28922	28922	I	94	“ Screw you ! ”
28934	28973	29012	29012	He	366	“ I ’m not insinuatin ’ you ’re a lesbian , if that ’s what you think . Not that there ’s anything wrong with bein ’ a lesbian — that just was n’t where I was headed . ”
28974	29011	28922	28922	I	94	“ You ’re so lucky the knives are in a drawer on the other side of the kitchen , because if I had one in my hand right now , I ’d gouge out your eyeballs . ”
29021	29055	29012	29012	He	366	“ My point is that if it ’s been a while since you were properly kissed , you ’ll need a little practice to get yourself up to speed for pretty boy Michael . ”
29059	29068	29056	29056	I	94	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
29078	29089	29056	29056	I	94	“ I ’m talkin ’ about bein ’ your coach . ”
29108	29121	29100	29100	I	94	“ Wait . You ’re offering to teach me how to kiss ? ”
29128	29135	29122	29122	His	366	“ Who better than Prince Pantydropper ? ”
29165	29172	29122	29122	His	366	“ Oh , I get it . ”
29177	29184	29173	29173	He	366	“ You get what , exactly ? ”
29185	29290	29173	29173	He	366	“ You ’re one of those guys who ca n’t stand it when a woman is n’t into him . Your ego is so inflated with the hot gas everyone blows up your butt , when you cross paths with someone who ’s indifferent , it drives you crazy . So you have to walk around half - naked showing off your collection of bulges and tattoos , and demand homemade meat loaves , and make outrageous statements like ‘ I ’ll be your kissing coach , ’ all so that your fragile yet ridiculously overblown ego wo n’t implode from lack of attention . ”
29294	29306	29291	29291	Cam	366	“ Thank you , Dr. Freud , for that excellent diagnosis . ”
29307	29312	29291	29291	Cam	366	“ You ’re welcome . ”
29313	29346	29291	29291	Cam	366	“ Too bad it ’s barmy . But I ’m interested in hearin ’ more about these ‘ bulges ’ you speak of . Are there any in particular that’re your favorites ? ”
29373	29404	29357	29357	he	366	“ I bet it ’s even more aggravating to you that the chubby girl is the one who ’s not all hot and bothered by your flagrant machismo , right ? ”
29433	29461	29424	29424	He	366	“ Tear yourself down in front of me again , woman , and I ’ll take you over my knee and make you wish you had n’t . ”
29498	29506	29507	29507	Cam	366	“ Why ’re your lips twitchin ’ ? ”
29514	29535	29507	29507	Cam	366	“ Because I ’m trying to decide if that ’s sweet , sexist , or so ridiculous I should laugh . ”
29556	29567	29547	29547	He	366	“ That ’s easy , lass . It ’s sweet . ”
29574	29583	29569	29570	this guy	489	“ Question . Purely for curiosity ’s sake . ”
29584	29587	29569	29570	this guy	489	“ Shoot . ”
29588	29602	29569	29570	this guy	489	“ Have you ever actually taken a woman over your knee as punishment ? ”
29615	29628	29609	29609	I	94	“ Nope . Never mind . I do n’t want to know . ”
29650	29655	29717	29717	Cam	366	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
29656	29661	29609	29609	I	94	“ Ugh . Headache . ”
29667	29690	29662	29662	Cam	366	“ I know you think I ’m irritatin ’ , but causin ’ an actual headache is on a whole other level . ”
29691	29716	29717	29717	Cam	366	“ It ’s not you . I mean it is you , but it ’s mainly because I have n’t eaten anything all day . ”
29720	29727	29717	29717	Cam	366	“ Why the bloody hell not ? ”
29731	29744	29717	29717	Cam	366	“ Oh , thanks for that . Shouting is great for headaches . ”
29745	29752	29717	29717	Cam	366	“ Do n’t avoid the question ! ”
29766	29784	29762	29762	Cam	366	“ This better not have anythin ’ to do with pretty boy and the office holiday party . ”
29852	29862	29840	29840	I	94	“ My stomach has just been a little upset . ”
29871	29879	29868	29868	Cam	366	“ You lie for shit , woman . ”
29902	29911	29893	29893	I	94	“ What makes you think I ’m lying ? ”
29912	29919	29880	29880	He	366	“ Student of humanity , remember ? ”
29936	29973	29893	29893	I	94	“ Okay , your face gets all scrunched up and your whole body does this cringy , foldin’-in - on - itself thing . You might as well be wearin ’ a sign on your forehead . ”
29974	29979	29893	29893	I	94	“ That is inconvenient . ”
29991	30002	29980	29980	Cam	366	“ No , lass . It ’s a good thing . ”
30010	30017	29980	29980	Cam	366	“ But starvation diets are not . ”
30018	30033	29893	29893	I	94	“ Could you please be less observant ? It ’s making my headache worse . ”
30034	30087	29980	29980	Cam	366	“ No , and tough . A headache is the price you pay for bein ’ a bloody idiot . Your body needs fuel , lass , and if it does n’t get it , it ’ll start to cannibalize your muscles , and then you ’ll have worse problems than headaches . ”
30091	30099	30088	30088	I	94	“ What ’re you , a doctor ? ”
30130	30142	30143	30143	He	366	“ Look at me , lass . Look at this body . ”
30160	30192	30127	30127	Cam	366	“ You think I got this perfect physique by starvin ’ myself ? You think I became the world ’s most famous , beloved athlete by tryin ’ to be skinny ? ”
30193	30211	30127	30127	Cam	366	“ I ’m sorry , could you repeat the question ? Your ego is blocking my ears . ”
30212	30236	30127	30127	Cam	366	“ The human body is a complex machine . A temple , as they say . You have to treat it like one ! ”
30237	30265	30127	30127	Cam	366	“ Yeah , well , my temple is more like an abandoned ruin the jungle has taken over and a herd of billy goats is living in . ”
30319	30331	30304	30304	she	42	“ What you need is a customized diet and exercise program . ”
30332	30341	30304	30304	she	42	“ Incorrect . What I need is liposuction . ”
30392	30412	30376	30376	I	94	“ No lipo . Your body will burn fat efficiently if you feed it properly and work it out . ”
30413	30465	30466	30466	Cam	366	“ Hooray . Unfortunately , I ’m addicted to carbs and sugar and allergic to exercise , so the only way I ’m going to burn fat is if someone comes at me with a blowtorch or if I stop eating altogether . I decided I ’d try option two first . ”
30499	30508	30496	30496	he	366	“ We start trainin ’ tomorrow mornin ’ . ”
30513	30540	30509	30509	I	94	“ I ’m not taking you up on your kissing coaching , pal , no matter how many panties you ’ve dropped ! Let it go . ”
30557	30567	30541	30541	He	366	“ I ’m talkin ’ about an exercise program . ”
30568	30589	30590	30590	I	94	“ Ha ! Me adopting an exercise routine is about as likely as you suddenly developing humility and fashion sense . ”
30610	30622	30623	30623	he	366	“ How much weight do you wanna lose by the party ? ”
30640	30694	30633	30633	I	94	“ A literal ton . And if you can add in glowing skin and a pair of boobs that do n’t look like something out of National Geographic , lengthen my legs by a few inches , and generally reduce my resemblance to the ogress Princess Fiona from Shrek , you ’re on . ”
30773	30783	30764	30764	I	94	“ Please do n’t bristle at me , McGregor . ”
30801	30813	30784	30784	He	366	“ Who . Told . You . You ’re . Ugly . ”
30814	30823	30784	30784	He	366	“ Every mirror I ’ve ever looked into . ”
30856	30870	30827	30827	Wolverine	148	“ Stop , McGregor . Just stop . I know how I look . ”
30871	30878	30908	30908	I	94	“ Maybe you need new glasses . ”
30912	31007	30908	30908	I	94	“ Do n’t you dare pity me or patronize me . And do n’t bullshit me , either . I own mirrors , and a scale , and have a younger sister who ’s won enough beauty contests that I know what pretty is supposed to look like . And I ’m not it . Which is fine — I’m not feeling sorry for myself . But when someone like you who ’s physically gifted tries to be kind about my appearance , it comes off as really disingenuous and honestly kind of cruel . ”
31074	31100	31069	31069	Cam	366	“ I do n’t pity you , Joellen . And I ’m a lot of things , but a bullshitter is n’t one of ’em . ”
31119	31124	31116	31116	Cam	366	“ Look at me . ”
31125	31158	31116	31116	Cam	366	“ I ’m too mad to look at you . Now be quiet before I take the meat loaf out of the oven and shove it up your stuck - up butt . ”
31168	31195	31165	31165	Cam	366	“ Y’know , lass , in some cultures when a woman constantly threatens a man with violence , it ’s a sure sign she likes him . ”
31210	31225	31196	31196	I	94	“ You ’re relentless . Also that ’s a totally made - up fact . ”
31226	31261	31269	31269	He	366	“ I ’m sure I read it somewhere , but here ’s a fact that is n’t made up . If you wanna look different for pretty boy , I ’m your best shot . ”
31287	31317	31269	31269	He	366	“ I was a runt as a boy , lass . The incredibly delectable body you see before you is self - made , forged from nothin’ but will . ”
31335	31380	31323	31323	he	366	“ This majestic display of manhood did n’t just happen . Cameron McGregor was n’t carved by Michelangelo ’s hand like the David . He was carved by his own . I ’m sure you ’ll agree , the results are even more spectacular . ”
31381	31400	31323	31323	he	366	“ Sorry , I think I just vomited a little in my mouth . What were you saying ? ”
31420	31425	31405	31405	Cam	366	“ Gimme your hand . ”
31434	31461	31426	31426	Leery	152	“ If you ’re thinking of giving me a tactile tour of other parts of your majestic manhood , you can go jump off a cliff . ”
31526	31560	31519	31519	he	366	“ When it comes to the body , I know what I ’m doin’ , lass . Gimme a chance to show you what I mean . I promise you ’ll be satisfied . ”
31700	31706	31681	31681	My	94	“ The Star - Spangled Banner ”
31850	31853	31847	31847	I	94	“ Hello ? ”
31854	31859	31861	31862	my mother	340	“ Hi , honey , ”
31864	31870	31861	31862	my mother	340	“ Why are you shouting ? ”
31871	31889	31847	31847	I	94	“ Oh , sorry , uh . . . I have my music on a little loud . ”
31921	31932	31912	31912	she	340	“ Who ’s that ? Is someone there with you ? ”
31952	31957	31938	31938	I	94	“ Just my neighbor . ”
31958	31962	31912	31912	she	340	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle ? ”
32005	32014	32002	32002	I	94	“ No , he ’s a new neighbor . ”
32033	32036	32024	32024	she	340	“ He ? ”
32124	32139	32112	32112	I	94	“ Do n’t start knitting baby booties yet , mother . He ’s gay . ”
32148	32164	32140	32140	Cam	366	“ Tell her my name and see what she says about me bein ’ gay . ”
32168	32172	32165	32165	I	94	“ Shut up ! ”
32177	32190	32165	32165	I	94	“ What did he say ? What ’s going on over there ? ”
32203	32214	32193	32193	I	94	“ My neighbor ’s just giving me some decorating advice . ”
32215	32234	32165	32165	I	94	“ Oh , how nice ! Maybe he can help you with your wardrobe , too , sweetie . ”
32268	32287	32260	32260	bastard!—he	154	“ Hullo , Mrs. Bixby . This is Cameron McGregor . Your daughter and I are in love . ”
32329	32332	32333	32333	he	366	“ Aye , ”
32345	32350	32351	32351	He	366	“ That Cameron McGregor . ”
32372	32382	32383	32383	he	366	“ Oh , your husband ’s a big fan ? ”
32390	32409	32383	32383	he	366	“ That ’s great to hear . Is he home ? I ’d love to talk to him . ”
32410	32425	32426	32426	Cam	366	“ Give me the phone , you big ape ! Give it to me ! ”
32527	32548	32493	32493	Cam	366	“ Hullo , sir . Aye , your wife was just telling me — yessir , it ’s really me . ”
32559	32590	32591	32591	Cam	366	“ No , no , nothin’ permanent . My cousin and I traded flats for the holidays . I needed a change of scenery , you could say . . . ”
32602	32615	32591	32591	Cam	366	“ Do n’t believe everything you read in the papers , sir . ”
32649	32666	32667	32667	He	366	“ Aye , it was a bang - up season . No injuries , touch wood . ”
32672	32680	32667	32667	He	366	“ You get the matches on cable ? ”
32690	32699	32667	32667	He	366	“ You can count on it , sir . ”
32716	32723	32701	32701	he	366	“ So I ’m discoverin ’ . ”
32732	32744	32728	32728	he	366	“ Actually I know several lads who think she ’s quite — ”
32762	32781	32758	32758	He	366	“ I do n’t know about your other daughter , sir , but this one ’s a belter . ”
32785	32798	32758	32758	He	366	“ It means ‘ fantastic . ’ Have yourself a good night . ”
32820	32829	32830	32830	he	366	“ Five o’clock tomorrow mornin ’ , lass , ”
32836	32861	32830	32830	he	366	“ Trainin ’ starts . If you ’re not ready , I ’ll kick down the door and drag you out of bed myself . ”
32882	32889	32890	32890	I	94	“ What about your meat loaf ? ”
32908	32919	32920	32921	my father	673	“ I ca n’t believe that was really Cameron McGregor ! ”
32935	32952	32920	32921	my father	673	“ Wait’ll I tell the guys at the club — they’ll totally flip out . Epic . ”
33044	33051	33052	33052	I	94	“ So he actually is famous , ”
33067	33072	33073	33074	My father	673	“ Are you kidding ? ”
33077	33097	33073	33074	My father	673	“ He ’s like , the athlete of all athletes ! How do you not know this , honey ? ”
33098	33133	33073	33074	My father	673	“ Because I hate organized sports and everyone who plays organized sports and would rather burn my eyes out with acid than be forced to watch or read anything to do with organized sports . ”
33141	33170	33134	33135	My father	673	“ Yes , I recall when your sister was on the volleyball and swim teams in high school , you refused to go to any of her meets . ”
33229	33242	33226	33226	I	94	“ Please tell me he ’s not more famous than Michael Jordan . ”
33247	33268	33243	33244	My father	673	“ He ’s way more famous than Michael Jordan ! He ’s basically the most famous athlete on the planet . ”
33315	33354	33382	33382	She	691	“ Holy cow Joellen how could you not tell me Cameron McGregor was living in your building that is crazy and you have him in your apartment oh my goodness wait till I tell Cindy she ’ll die . ”
33355	33381	33382	33382	She	691	“ You ’re forbidden from telling anyone , Mom , especially that blabbermouth Cindy ! It ’ll be all over Twitter within half an hour ! ”
33396	33431	33382	33382	She	691	“ Is he as gorgeous in person as he is in photos ? Is he really as muscular as he looks on TV ? What about his hair ? Does he have good ha — ”
33432	33447	33382	33382	She	691	“ Mother . Focus . He ’s a person , not a sex object . ”
33471	33511	33465	33466	my mother	340	“ I ’m sorry , we seem to have a bad connection . I thought I just heard my daughter say that Cameron McGregor , the sex object to end all sex objects , is not a sex object . ”
33526	33552	33517	33517	I	94	“ He ’s actually pretty smart , if you want the truth . He ’s very intuitive , and he ’s got an amazing vocabulary . ”
33563	33582	33558	33558	I	94	“ Okay , fine . Yes , he ’s muscular . And he has good hair . Satisfied ? ”
33583	33597	33631	33631	she	340	“ No , I ’m not satisfied ! Details , sweetie , details ! ”
33598	33625	33558	33558	I	94	“ I never thought I ’d hear myself speak these words , Mother , but I think you ’re overdue for some sexy times with Dad . ”
33638	33643	33631	33631	she	340	“ we ’re best girlfriends ”
33652	33689	33631	33631	she	340	“ I ’ll tell you what , sweetie , your father is in for some big fun tonight , because Mama ’s hot tamale is en fuego at the thought of Cameron McGregor in the flesh ! ”
33690	33703	33631	33631	she	340	“ I have to go now . My mental breakdown is calling . ”
33704	33712	33713	33713	Her	340	“ My God , that Scottish brogue . ”
33720	33729	33713	33713	Her	340	“ And a sense of humor , too ! ”
33730	33739	33631	33631	she	340	“ What did he say that was funny ? ”
33740	33748	33713	33713	Her	340	“ That you two were in love ! ”
33749	33764	33765	33765	I	94	“ Oh , that . Yeah , he ’s a real laugh a minute , ”
33778	33784	33765	33765	I	94	“ Why was that funny ? ”
33789	33807	33785	33786	My mother	1975	“ Oh , honey ! As if a man like that could fall in love with you ! ”
33830	33841	33852	33852	Her	1975	“ I did n’t mean it like that , sweetie — ”
33842	33851	33852	33852	Her	1975	“ I know exactly how you meant it . ”
33857	33865	33852	33852	Her	1975	“ Joellen , do n’t do that . ”
33866	33877	33852	33852	Her	1975	“ Do what ? Feel insulted when someone insults me ? ”
33878	33891	33852	33852	Her	1975	“ Turn a harmless comment into one of your personal pity parties ! ”
33939	33960	33936	33936	I	94	“ Mom , my dinner ’s ready . Thanks for the call . I ’ll talk to you next week . ”
34062	34067	34059	34060	the loser	699	“ This is yours . ”
34079	34090	34068	34068	He	366	“ I was n’t gon na turn the music on . ”
34091	34115	34068	34068	He	366	“ You know what ? It ’s okay if you do . Who am I to tell you how to live your life ? ”
34161	34165	34166	34166	I	94	“ Five o’clock , ”
34170	34177	34166	34166	I	94	“ I ’ll see you then . ”
34238	34242	34243	34243	Cam	366	“ Keep up ! ”
34283	34292	34293	34293	My	94	“ Must . Stop . Death . Imminent . ”
34337	34340	34341	34341	he	366	“ Joellen , ”
34345	34354	34341	34341	he	366	“ We ’re two blocks from the apartment . ”
34355	34367	34368	34368	I	94	“ Oh my God ! I made it two whole blocks ? ”
34413	34433	34396	34396	Cam	366	“ How did this happen ? You ’ve got the cardiovascular system of a ninety - year - old ! ”
34437	34447	34434	34434	I	94	“ I told you I was allergic to exercise ! ”
34458	34465	34448	34448	He	366	“ I thought you were joking . ”
34497	34508	34485	34486	the man	366	“ Are you always this ornery in the mornin ’ ? ”
34509	34520	34521	34521	I	94	“ Do n’t you dare taunt me , devil man . ”
34549	34567	34541	34541	I	94	“ What was in that green goop you forced me to drink before we left ? Poison ? ”
34577	34611	34568	34568	Cam	366	“ Yep . It ’s an old Scottish tradition . A draught of poison just after wakin ’ . If it does n’t kill you , it ’ll put hair on your chest . ”
34612	34616	34619	34619	Wheeze	164	“ Oh goody . ”
34621	34627	34628	34628	Wheeze	164	“ Just what I need . ”
34632	34638	34628	34628	Wheeze	164	“ Hair on my chest . ”
34660	34689	34657	34657	Cam	366	“ If you ’re about to follow that little speech with somethin’ derogatory about your looks , I ’ll kick your arse six ways to Sunday , lassie . ”
34718	34733	34714	34714	mine	94	“ That dang dog again ! I ’m really starting to hate that dog ! ”
34824	34843	34844	34844	Cam	366	“ I ca n’t believe you voluntarily do this every day . For free . Not at gunpoint . ”
34859	34866	34844	34844	Cam	366	“ All for a good cause . ”
34881	34900	34867	34867	I	94	“ Do you hold yourself tightly in bed at night while whispering sweet nothings into your own ear ? ”
34901	34930	34844	34844	Cam	366	“ Think of pretty boy . Visualize his face when you walk into the holiday party in a sexy dress , lookin ’ all toned and bedazzlin ’ . ”
34946	34955	34931	34931	I	94	“ Toned is good . Skinny is better . ”
34956	35008	34867	34867	I	94	“ Wrong ! Strong is the goal , lass , not skinny . A man does n’t wanna grab onto a sack of rattlin ’ bones when he ’s in the mood . He wants a nice , thick , juicy woman with buttery curves , sizzlin ’ hot and tasty . ”
35009	35018	34931	34931	I	94	“ You literally just described my perfect steak . ”
35019	35041	34867	34867	I	94	“ My mum always said you ca n’t trust a skinny woman . Skinny body , skinny heart , skinny love . ”
35042	35050	34931	34931	I	94	“ I think I love your mother . ”
35051	35054	35056	35056	Cam	366	“ Aye , ”
35059	35066	35056	35056	Cam	366	“ She was easy to love . ”
35122	35127	35113	35113	he	366	“ She passed away ? ”
35136	35141	35113	35113	he	366	“ I ’m sorry . ”
35204	35215	35216	35216	His	366	“ Hundred years ago . Ancient history . But thanks . ”
35284	35306	35275	35275	Cam	366	“ Quit your lollygaggin ’ , lass , and pick up your feet ! We ’re only just gettin ’ started ! ”
35359	35367	35368	35368	I	94	“ I see you , Cameron McGregor , ”
35479	35488	35490	35490	Shasta	125	“ What ’s all the groaning over there ? ”
35512	35521	35522	35522	She	125	“ I started working out . Kill me . ”
35547	35560	35540	35540	she	125	“ Pilates ? Peloton ? Krav Maga ? Kundalini ? Booty Twerk ? ”
35561	35568	35522	35522	She	125	“ What language are you speaking ? ”
35569	35576	35540	35540	she	125	“ I ’m into capoeira myself . ”
35589	35605	35586	35586	she	125	“ It ’s a Brazilian martial art combining dance , music , and acrobatic movements . ”
35623	35636	35615	35615	Her	125	“ All things I suck at . Remind me never to go . ”
35637	35644	35586	35586	she	125	“ So what ’re you doing ? ”
35652	35655	35645	35645	I	94	“ Jogging . ”
35664	35670	35671	35671	Her	125	“ And really aggressive stretching . ”
35675	35681	35661	35661	I	94	“ Like , torture stretching . ”
35691	35723	35687	35687	she	125	“ Cool . Hard - core stretching is good for sex . My boyfriend is super limber . He likes to hold a backbend while I ride him like a bull . ”
35788	35795	35796	35796	She	125	“ You ’re a lucky girl . ”
35810	35822	35796	35796	She	125	“ Totally . D’you want to see a picture of him ? ”
35860	35863	35864	35864	she	723	“ Joellen , ”
35911	35914	35915	35915	I	94	“ Portia , ”
35938	35945	35934	35934	Her	723	“ Will you please follow me ? ”
35997	36006	35991	35991	she	723	“ Um . . . is everything okay ? ”
36007	36016	35991	35991	she	723	“ You have a meeting with human resources . ”
36029	36036	36042	36042	she	723	“ I do ? Since when ? ”
36037	36041	36042	36042	she	723	“ Since now , ”
36102	36117	36095	36095	Shasta	125	“ If you ’re getting fired , I call dibs on your new chair . ”
36199	36218	36220	36220	Shasta	125	“ You better hurry up , Joellen . Portia looked like she was about to bust a nut . ”
36351	36355	36357	36357	Ruth	173	“ Come in , ”
36518	36524	36525	36525	Ruth	173	“ Are you all right ? ”
36543	36548	36549	36549	I	94	“ Yes , sorry , ”
36554	36568	36549	36549	I	94	“ I just started working out , and I ’m a little sore . ”
36574	36590	36569	36569	Ruth	173	“ Good for you ! Regular exercise is the best way to maintain your health ! ”
36661	36679	36680	36680	She	340	“ I understand you ’ve just passed your ten - year anniversary with the firm , Joellen . ”
36701	36712	36693	36693	she	340	“ And in that time you ’ve missed . . . ”
36738	36742	36731	36731	She	340	“ One day . ”
36743	36750	36751	36751	I	94	“ I had uterine fibroid surgery ! ”
36766	36804	36751	36751	I	94	“ I scheduled it for first thing in the morning because I wanted to come in in the afternoon , but my surgeon would n’t allow it , so I had . . . to . . . ”
36830	36843	36822	36822	Portia	340	“ Um . . . take the rest of the day off . ”
36856	36867	36868	36868	she	173	“ Of course you had to take the day off , ”
36873	36897	36868	36868	she	173	“ Joellen , that ’s major surgery ! I had fibroids removed in my thirties — you should ’ve taken a week off ! ”
36930	36941	36920	36920	Portia	340	“ Let ’s cut to the chase , shall we ? ”
36959	36967	36943	36943	Ruth	173	“ I do n’t have all day . ”
37025	37036	37038	37038	Ruth	173	“ The raise you requested last month has been approved , ”
37062	37075	37076	37076	Portia	340	“ Really ? That ’s fantastic ! I ca n’t believe it ! ”
37179	37186	37188	37188	Portia	340	“ I think you killed it , ”
37233	37247	37222	37222	Michael	142	“ Sorry to barge in . Did we give her the good news ? ”
37284	37294	37296	37297	Ruth primly	173	“ We were just getting started with our meeting , ”
37304	37317	37301	37301	Michael	142	“ So you have n’t told her about the open position yet ? ”
37359	37370	37372	37372	Portia	340	“ We have n’t even p - posted it yet ! ”
37382	37398	37372	37372	Portia	340	“ Bill can take over the extra work for the time being , or Konrad — ”
37399	37402	37403	37403	Michael	142	“ Nonsense . ”
37413	37426	37403	37403	Michael	142	“ Joellen , unfortunately Maria wo n’t be returning to work because — ”
37440	37449	37450	37450	He	142	“ Oh . Er . . . right . ”
37459	37470	37450	37450	He	142	“ Maria is no longer an employee of Maddox Publishing . ”
37471	37476	37477	37477	I	94	“ Um . Okay ? ”
37526	37546	37510	37510	she	53	“ Maria had just been promoted to associate editor . We were going to make the announcement this week . ”
37603	37612	37613	37613	I	94	“ There ’s an associate editor position open ? ”
37619	37625	37613	37613	I	94	“ Would you be interested ? ”
37659	37665	37646	37646	I	94	“ Yes . I would . ”
37666	37679	37681	37681	Ruth	173	“ Obviously the position is at a higher pay grade , Joellen , ”
37683	37714	37681	37681	Ruth	173	“ so since you ’ve been approved for a raise , if you got the job , you ’d get a bump from the starting salary to reflect your raise . ”
37767	37773	37790	37790	Michael	142	“ That ’s amazing news . ”
37777	37789	37774	37774	Portia	340	“ You have to apply for it , like everyone else ! ”
37841	37870	37830	37830	Portia	340	“ Of course . All the proper protocols must be followed . But you have seniority , Joellen , and an exceptional work record , and I encourage you strongly”—her
37877	37880	37957	37957	I	94	accomplice—“to apply . ”
37898	37915	37881	37881	Portia	340	“ As the editorial director , the final selection will , of course , be mine . ”
37945	37956	37942	37942	He	142	“ Technically , Portia , the final selection is mine . ”
37980	37989	37973	37973	her	340	“ Yes , Mr. Maddox . Of course . ”
38036	38051	38023	38023	He	142	“ I ’d like to see your application by the end of the week . ”
38059	38062	38052	38052	He	142	“ Ladies . ”
38079	38109	38075	38075	Ruth	173	“ Well ! I think we ’re done here ! Joellen , you can go back to work . I ’ll bring the application by your desk later today . ”
38572	38577	38558	38558	He	366	“ Oh . Hi . ”
38578	38595	38558	38558	He	366	“ Hi yourself , lass . Why ’re you blinkin ’ like a startled baby bird ? ”
38604	38610	38596	38596	I	94	“ Were you expecting someone ? ”
38611	38619	38558	38558	He	366	“ You mean someone other than you ? ”
38620	38625	38596	38596	I	94	“ Well , yeah . ”
38646	38661	38639	38639	he	366	“ Y’know , lass , for a bright girl , you ’re bloody dense . ”
38662	38694	38558	38558	He	366	“ Aha . That explains everything , thanks . And by the way , why do you use the word bloody to describe things that have nothing to do with blood ? ”
38695	38726	38639	38639	he	366	“ Why do you use the word gorgeous to describe a man who ’s had so much plastic surgery he looks like he was created for Madame Tussauds wax museum ? ”
38733	38741	38727	38727	I	94	“ Are you referring to Michael Maddox ? ”
38752	38782	38744	38744	Cam	366	“ Aye . Looked him up on the company website . And I ’ve got ta tell you , lass , that is one odd - lookin ’ boy . ”
38783	38811	38558	38558	He	366	“ He ’s not a boy . He ’s a man ! And he ’s not odd - looking in the least ! He ’s classically handsome ! ”
38812	38828	38744	38744	Cam	366	“ He looks like a doll . Only with less to add to a conversation . ”
38838	38871	38829	38829	I	94	“ I see . And you think a ‘ real ’ man should look like what ? A lumberjack ? Someone with irregular access to a razor and a bar of soap ? ”
38872	38898	38558	38558	He	366	“ I ’ll bet you fifty dollars he uses a pore - reducing mask and slathers on expensive antiaging skin cream before bed every night . ”
38899	38933	38829	38829	I	94	“ Can I just point out at this juncture in the conversation that these observations are ridiculous coming from a man who apparently does n’t believe in clothing himself from the waist up ? ”
39030	39043	39008	39008	He	366	“ It ’s impossible to find shirts that fit all these muscles . ”
39049	39062	39044	39044	I	94	“ Dude , you lift the definition of egomaniac to new heights . ”
39068	39072	39063	39063	He	366	“ Thank you . ”
39073	39080	39063	39063	He	366	“ It was n’t a compliment . ”
39081	39088	39063	39063	He	366	“ That ’s what you think . ”
39100	39132	39089	39089	I	94	“ Moving on . Dinner ’s in an hour . It will be better than my loaf and my pie . And one more thing , Tarzan . Wear a shirt . ”
39150	39182	39089	39089	I	94	“ I could , but you ’ll probably only end up tearin ’ it off me at the end of the night , lassie . Waste of a perfectly good shirt . ”
39256	39319	39251	39253	a porn star	777	“ Sweet Jesus . Oh , for the love of all that ’s holy . That ’s so bloody good . Ach , it ’s like a party in my mouth . Like an orgy in my mouth ! If I died at this moment , I ’d be happy , because I would ’ve finally discovered the meanin ’ of life . ”
39339	39348	39332	39332	I	94	“ The meaning of life is rigatoni carbonara ? ”
39349	39378	39459	39459	Cam	366	“ No , lass . The meanin ’ of life is rigatoni carbonara with homemade garlic bread , black - truffle gnocchi , and a weird fruity salad . ”
39379	39410	39332	39332	I	94	“ It ’s a fennel , orange , mint , red chicory , pomegranate , balsamic , and extra virgin olive oil salad , not a ‘ weird ’ salad . ”
39432	39446	39422	39422	he	366	“ Details . My point is that it ’s pure braw . Pedro . ”
39447	39458	39459	39459	Cam	366	“ What ’s ‘ braw ’ and who ’s Pedro ? ”
39471	39479	39459	39459	Cam	366	“ It means ‘ amazin ’ . ’ ”
39480	39488	39422	39422	he	366	“ You could ’ve just said that . ”
39489	39493	39494	39494	He	366	“ I did ! ”
39511	39538	39422	39422	he	366	“ I ’m glad you like it . But do n’t expect this for the remainder of your bribery meals , because today we ’re celebrating . ”
39539	39543	39544	39544	he	366	“ Oh yeah ? ”
39550	39557	39544	39544	he	366	“ What ’re we celebratin ’ ? ”
39558	39564	39565	39565	Cam	366	“ I got a raise . ”
39569	39589	39590	39590	I	94	“ And there ’s an associate editor position open , which the HR director encouraged me to apply for . ”
39610	39624	39607	39607	he	366	“ Congratulations , lass . You deserve the raise , I ’m sure . ”
39638	39671	39630	39630	his	366	“ Why does that feel like one of those backhanded compliments I get on blind dates , like ‘ It ’s great that you ’re not obsessed with how you look ’ ? ”
39698	39707	39688	39688	he	366	“ Just seems a little coincidental is all . ”
39708	39723	39672	39672	Cam	366	“ How is it coincidental ? I applied for the raise a month ago ! ”
39731	39755	39724	39724	His	366	“ Uh - huh . And you ’re gettin ’ it the week pretty boy replaced your chair and I sent you roses . ”
39756	39764	39724	39724	His	366	“ God , you ’re a buzzkill . ”
39765	39783	39724	39724	His	366	“ Just pointin ’ it out . What ’s the deal with the position that ’s open ? ”
39842	39852	39876	39876	He	366	“ The girl who had the job left suddenly . ”
39890	39927	39876	39876	He	366	“ McGregor , your imagination is almost as overactive as mine . There ’s no conspiracy here , you big lug ! It ’s just an open position ! People leave their jobs all the time ! ”
39935	39939	39928	39928	He	366	“ Do they ? ”
39966	40010	39953	39953	I	94	“ So this is interesting . I ’m discovering new aspects to your personality every day . Giant ego , check . Fetish for tight leg wear and bad music , check . Ingrained suspicion of good luck and active paranoia , check . ”
40011	40021	40068	40068	Cam	366	“ It ’s not paranoia if you ’re right . ”
40022	40029	40030	40030	I	94	“ Let me get this straight . ”
40050	40067	40044	40044	I	94	“ Your theory is that Michael Maddox has targeted me . . . for career advancement ? ”
40082	40099	40068	40068	Cam	366	“ You could make Mother Teresa go on a multistate killing spree , you know that ? ”
40100	40121	40068	40068	Cam	366	“ You give the best compliments , darlin ’ . Get yourself a plate before I finish all this food . ”
40122	40128	40068	40068	Cam	366	“ I ’m not eating . ”
40137	40150	40068	40068	Cam	366	“ Be quiet , White Fang . You ’ll frighten the neighbors . ”
40151	40157	40158	40158	he	366	“ Did you eat today ? ”
40169	40172	40068	40068	Cam	366	“ Yes . ”
40178	40190	40173	40173	He	366	“ Besides the protein drink I gave you this mornin ’ ? ”
40312	40317	40307	40307	He	366	“ Eat . Now . ”
40324	40332	40318	40318	I	94	“ I do n’t have a fork . ”
40342	40352	40336	40336	he	366	“ You ’re pushin ’ your luck , woman . ”
40353	40373	40318	40318	I	94	“ Unlike some people in this kitchen , I ’m not a big fan of eating with my fingers . ”
40417	40445	40446	40446	Cam	366	“ If I ’d known it sets you off when people skip meals , I ’d have gone on a hunger strike the moment I met you . ”
40468	40477	40478	40478	he	366	“ It ’s not the meal skippin ’ , ”
40485	40493	40478	40478	he	366	“ It ’s the reason behind it . ”
40599	40619	40620	40620	Cam	366	“ Pushin ’ your food around with your fork and takin ’ spider bites does n’t count as eating , ”
40626	40631	40632	40632	I	94	“ Okay , Dad , ”
40676	40683	40666	40668	a good girl	784	“ Better . Do it again . ”
40738	40745	40746	40746	he	366	“ Speakin ’ of your father , ”
40756	40762	40746	40746	he	366	“ what ’s his deal ? ”
40763	40784	40725	40725	Cam	366	“ My dad ? Oh , he ’s a photographer . I mean he was . He ’s retired now . ”
40785	40796	40746	40746	he	366	“ Yeah ? What kind of pictures did he take ? ”
40797	40827	40725	40725	Cam	366	“ He did some work for the movie studios , but his bread and butter was fashion photography . Modeling shoots , magazine spreads , that kind of thing . ”
40828	40838	40746	40746	he	366	“ So he worked with a lot of models . ”
40850	40864	40839	40839	I	94	“ And actors . ‘ The beautiful people , ’ he called them . ”
40865	40870	40725	40725	Cam	366	“ And your mum ? ”
40871	40910	40839	40839	I	94	“ She was a runway model . They met on a shoot in Paris , actually . Now she mostly gets colonics and obsesses over finding the perfect macrobiotic lettuce on her daily trips to the farmers market . ”
40918	40927	40911	40911	Cam	366	“ And your sister ’s a beauty queen . ”
40928	40994	40995	40995	I	94	“ Yup , Jacqueline made it all the way to the Miss America pageant . Got beat out by a farm girl from Kansas . I do n’t think she ’s ever recovered . Her and my mom are practically identical twins — your classic leggy California blonde type . My dad , too . He looks like a surfer — very tan and fit . ”
40998	41024	40995	40995	I	94	“ My sister used to tease me when we were kids that I was adopted , because I look nothing like anyone in the family . ”
41043	41049	41032	41032	His	366	“ That explains a lot . ”
41060	41067	41050	41050	I	94	“ What are you talking about ? ”
41068	41085	41086	41086	I	94	“ Your negative body image , damaged self - esteem , and conflicted relationship with food . ”
41104	41108	41109	41109	Cam	366	“ Excuse me ? ”
41112	41139	41109	41109	Cam	366	“ You ’ve got a model mother , a beauty queen sister , and a father surrounded by perfect - lookin ’ people his entire career — ”
41140	41154	41155	41155	I	94	“ You ’re in no position to criticize my family or psychoanalyze me , ”
41167	41187	41155	41155	I	94	“ And let ’s not forget , you ’re pretty taken by your own looks , too , McGregor . ”
41188	41220	41109	41109	Cam	366	“ Maybe I am , maybe I ’m not . But I ’d never make someone else feel bad about themselves because they did n’t conform to my idea of perfection . ”
41221	41235	41155	41155	I	94	“ And that ’s what you ’re suggesting my family did to me ? ”
41236	41241	41109	41109	Cam	366	“ Did n’t they ? ”
41260	41271	41256	41256	he	786	“ I think your forty - five minutes are up . ”
41318	41321	41360	41360	he	366	“ Joellen — ”
41322	41335	41360	41360	he	366	“ Stop . Not another word . You can let yourself out . ”
41363	41373	41352	41352	his	366	“ Are we still on for the mornin ’ ? ”
41388	41391	41374	41374	I	94	“ Yes . ”
41392	41395	41396	41396	he	366	“ Okay , ”
41403	41406	41407	41407	He	366	“ Good . ”
41422	41437	41407	41407	He	366	“ For what it ’s worth , lass . . . they ’re wrong . ”
41595	41598	41599	41599	he	366	“ Hi , ”
41652	41672	41673	41673	His	366	“ Hi . This is the least skin I ’ve ever seen of yours . Are you feeling okay ? ”
41685	41711	41678	41678	he	366	“ If you want , I can take off my shirt . It ’ll cut at least five minutes off your warm - up time . ”
41712	41722	41673	41673	His	366	“ There he is . Good morning , prancer . ”
41723	41730	41731	41731	He	366	“ Mornin ’ , dragon lady . ”
41767	41770	41771	41771	I	94	“ Wait . ”
41789	41796	41771	41771	I	94	“ Where did this come from ? ”
41797	41801	41771	41771	I	94	“ My blender . ”
41802	41814	41771	41771	I	94	“ You have a blender in the back of your pants ? ”
41815	41822	41771	41771	I	94	“ It was in my waistband . ”
41828	41861	41862	41862	He	366	“ You thought it was a good idea to carry a bottle of liquid in your waistband for a five - foot walk across a hall ? Are both your hands broken ? ”
41881	41915	41862	41862	He	366	“ The hands are fully operational , lass . In case you ’ve a mind to give a lad a tactile tour of your majestic lady parts , as you ’d put it . ”
41916	41939	41862	41862	He	366	“ Please tell me you ’re wearing underwear and that this bottle was n’t , like , resting on your butt crack . ”
41948	41976	41945	41945	he	366	“ Aye , lass , you caught me . It ’s a bottle of butt crack juice . Drink up , it ’s full o ’ vitamins . ”
41977	41980	41945	41945	he	366	“ Vitamins ? ”
42011	42013	41998	42022	a man who thought every dish could be improved by adding a certain “ natural ” ingredient produced only by a pair of male testicles	791	“ natural ”
42039	42056	42030	42032	Slightly Saltier Caviar	185	“ Just drink the bloody thing , lass . It ’s juiced veggies and protein powder ! ”
42078	42094	42095	42095	I	94	“ Fine . But if this tastes suspiciously salty , I ’m kicking your ass . ”
42110	42124	42125	42125	His	366	“ The only salty thing in this hallway is you , darlin ’ . ”
42223	42247	42218	42218	Cam	366	“ Uh - oh . You must ’ve had a dirty thought about pretty boy Michael . Your face just turned to beet . ”
42264	42282	42260	42260	Cam	366	“ A little early in the mornin ’ to be feelin ’ frisky , innit , sweetheart ? ”
42310	42316	42317	42317	I	94	“ Let ’s get started , ”
42336	42347	42326	42326	He	366	“ Okay , okay , no need to get testy . ”

46774	46788	46728	46728	I	94	“ Because real men do n’t drink sissy , pale - colored beer . ”
46789	46802	46709	46709	he	63	“ Exactly . I knew you thought I was a real man . ”
46803	46861	46728	46728	I	94	“ The jury ’s still out , pal . You wear an awful lot of skirts . I ’m afraid I might find you raiding my closet one of these nights . But if you need a friend to talk to about it , I ’m down . I ’ll even let you try on my bras . ”

47137	47149	47123	47123	McGregor	366	“ There ’s another guy at work you ’re interested in ? ”
47150	47183	47243	47243	he	366	“ No . Ew . Denny is like seventy years old . And fart jokes are n’t exactly the thing to make a girl swoon . But speaking of work . . . ”

47260	47271	47329	47329	He	366	“ Oh my God . You ’re already ruining it ! ”
47282	47307	47272	47272	He	366	“ If you had a girlfriend who told you her still - married boss almost kissed her at work , what would you say ? ”
47319	47328	47329	47329	He	366	“ It sounds bad when you say it . ”
47348	47360	47342	47342	I	94	“ Okay , but you have n’t heard the whole story . ”
47366	47373	47361	47361	He	366	“ I ’m breathless with anticipation . ”
47428	47431	47432	47432	I	94	“ What ? ”
47439	47446	47432	47432	I	94	“ You think you ’re old ? ”
47455	47478	47479	47479	Heat	195	“ You said the sonnet you recited to him was called ‘ Ode to Old Chicks . ’ Was that about yourself ? ”
47490	47499	47479	47479	Heat	195	“ I ’m thirty - six , McGregor . ”
47500	47508	47479	47479	Heat	195	“ And you think that ’s old ? ”
47509	47518	47479	47479	Heat	195	“ Are you screwing with me right now ? ”
47538	47586	47519	47519	He	370	“ Never mind . Back to the big picture . Married boss . Single employee . An almost kiss in the company kitchen . The possibility of flushin ’ your whole career down the toilet if your friend the wicked witch decides to report you to management . ”
47587	47592	47621	47621	Cam	366	“ Michael is management . ”
47593	47611	47519	47519	He	370	“ Aye . And you ’re up for a promotion . How ’s that gon na look ? ”
47635	47708	47717	47717	she	173	“ Do n’t be naïve . If that woman wants to , she can make big problems for you at work . There ’s all sorts o ’ ways she can make your life hell . Smear your reputation . Turn people against you . Undermine the legitimacy of your hard work by sayin ’ the promotion is only ’cause you ’re bangin ’ the boss . Use your imagination , lass . ”
47759	47782	47783	47783	I	94	“ Bummer . And here I was thinking I ’d take you up on that offer to teach me how to kiss . ”
47787	47796	47783	47783	I	94	“ That ’s the least of my troubles ! ”
47829	47842	47819	47819	Cam	366	“ Dude . Seriously . That ’s freaky . Cut it out . ”
47843	47850	47864	47864	Cam	366	“ I just had a thought . ”
47851	47863	47819	47819	Cam	366	“ Another one ? This is a record week for you . ”
47894	47917	47882	47882	he	366	“ Maybe I ’m bein ’ too hard on you , lass . I did offer you my help , after all . ”
47918	47924	47882	47882	he	366	“ Yes , you did . ”
47925	47933	47882	47882	he	366	“ So . Go ahead , then . ”
47944	47950	47934	47934	I	94	“ Go ahead and what ? ”
47951	47955	47882	47882	he	366	“ Kiss me . ”
47979	48010	47976	47976	Cam	366	“ C’m on , let ’s see what you ’ve got . I have to know what I ’m workin ’ with if I ’m gon na be any help . ”
48030	48060	48027	48027	Cam	366	“ Or do n’t . It ’s no sweat off my back if pretty boy tries to kiss you and winds up with a face full o ’ slobber . ”
48076	48079	48061	48061	He	366	“ Wait ! ”
48086	48093	48094	48094	I	94	“ Um . . . okay . ”
48100	48108	48094	48094	I	94	“ But you ca n’t touch me . ”
48109	48113	48114	48114	he	366	“ I see , ”
48118	48131	48114	48114	he	366	“ So it ’ll just be our auras kissin ’ , then . ”
48132	48141	48094	48094	I	94	“ Stop being sarcastic . This is serious ! ”
48152	48188	48142	48142	Cam	366	“ Lass . I do n’t know how long it ’s been since you ’ve kissed someone , but there are these things called lips involved ? I ’m pretty sure that counts as touching . ”
48189	48196	48142	48142	Cam	366	“ I meant with your hands ! ”
48207	48215	48197	48197	He	366	“ I would n’t dream of it . ”
48227	48237	48224	48224	he	366	“ Tell you what . I ’ll stand here like this”—he
48260	48273	48258	48258	they	862	pinned—“and you can do your thing with no worry about stray hands . ”
48342	48351	48326	48327	The guy	366	“ That was my lung you just licked ! ”
48427	48437	48419	48419	Cam	366	“ Promise me it wo n’t be weird after . ”
48438	48465	48419	48419	Cam	366	“ Well , you ’re obviously gon na fall instantly in love with me , lass , but it wo n’t be weird on my end . ”
48489	48503	48479	48479	I	94	“ Do you have any STDs that can be passed through your saliva ? ”
48511	48518	48504	48504	He	366	“ I ’m just being safe . ”
48519	48529	48504	48504	He	366	“ No , you ’re just bein ’ chicken . ”
48530	48537	48504	48504	He	366	“ I ’m not a chicken ! ”
48563	48582	48553	48553	I	94	“ Fine . We ’re doing this . If you get handsy , I ’ll crack your skull . ”
48655	48664	48665	48665	I	94	“ You have gold flecks in your eyes , ”
48671	48682	48668	48668	He	366	“ Maybe you should write a sonnet about my beauty . ”
48690	48694	48683	48683	I	94	“ Shut up . ”
48695	48725	48668	48668	He	366	“ C’m on lass , you ’re makin ’ too much of a production of this . Just get it over with . I do n’t have all night . ”
48731	48746	48726	48726	I	94	“ Sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time , prancer ! ”
48747	48773	48683	48683	I	94	“ You ’re forgiven . Now lay one on me so I can give you some helpful tips for your quest to land Mr. Perfect . ”
48791	48809	48777	48777	I	94	“ Okay , but . . . when you give me your tips , please be gentle . ”
48824	48846	48810	48810	Cam	366	“ I ’m not exactly talented in this area . The last guy I kissed was left with permanent emotional scars . ”
48855	48863	48847	48847	His	366	“ I promise I ’ll be nice . ”
48906	48911	48912	48912	Cam	366	“ Close your eyes . ”
49054	49059	49047	49047	He	366	“ Was that it ? ”
49060	49063	49064	49064	I	94	“ Yes ! ”
49074	49082	49064	49064	I	94	“ Why ? Was it that bad ? ”
49083	49099	49047	49047	He	366	“ No , it was perfectly fine , lass . If I were your grandma . ”
49114	49123	49064	49064	I	94	“ Oh my God , you ’re impossible . ”
49139	49170	49129	49129	he	366	“ You were just nervous , lass . It was a good first effort , nothin’ to be embarrassed about . But if I could make a suggestion . . . ”
49189	49192	49185	49185	they	869	“ What ? ”
49193	49200	49230	49230	His	366	“ Do n’t hold your breath . ”
49201	49213	49185	49185	they	869	“ Oh . I was doing that , was n’t I ? ”
49217	49229	49214	49214	Cam	366	“ Just try to relax into it . Also . . . ”
49235	49242	49230	49230	His	366	“ A real kiss includes tongue . ”
49246	49278	49243	49243	I	94	“ To be completely honest , I ’m afraid my tongue has a mind of its own . You might find yourself in a wrestling match to the death with it . ”
49300	49306	49279	49279	He	366	“ It ’s not funny ! ”
49307	49317	49279	49279	He	366	“ It ’s hilarious , and you know it ! ”
49335	49344	49332	49332	I	94	“ Oh God . I ’m so pathetic . ”
49352	49361	49362	49362	he	366	“ No , goddammit , you ’re not , ”
49369	49393	49362	49362	he	366	“ Now kiss me again before I change my mind and take you over my knee for bein ’ such a bloody idiot . ”
49574	49577	49578	49578	I	94	“ Oh ! ”
49627	49632	49633	49633	he	366	“ Easy , lass , ”
49643	49650	49633	49633	he	366	“ We ’re not done yet . ”
49690	49696	49697	49697	he	1863	“ Think of pretty boy , ”
49721	49746	49697	49697	he	1863	“ Pretend I ’m him . Pretend it ’s his mouth on yours . His body against yours . His hand in your hair . ”
49994	50001	50002	50002	My	94	“ Someone ’s at the door . ”
50012	50020	50021	50021	His	94	“ Are you gon na answer it ? ”
50040	50046	50033	50033	I	94	“ It could be important . ”
50072	50078	50066	50066	his	366	“ More important than this ? ”
50257	50267	50247	50247	I	94	“ Since when do you smoke , Mrs. Dinwiddle ? ”
50268	50278	50372	50372	She	1817	“ Good gracious , Ducky , I do n’t ! ”
50300	50371	50290	50290	She	1817	“ Oh , this ! Is n’t it elegant ? I found it in a trunk yesterday afternoon , packed away in the back of my closet with some of my old stage costumes . I had Blessica run to the store for a pack of cigarettes , because it looked quite sad without one . Ducky , did you know a pack of cigarettes costs thirteen dollars ? Shocking ! ”
50392	50402	50383	50383	I	94	“ How can I help you , Mrs. Dinwiddle ? ”
50440	50461	50485	50485	She	1817	“ I had a thought , my dear , since you ’ve embarked on your program of self - improvement . ”
50469	50484	50462	50462	I	94	“ Who told you I ’ve embarked on a program of self - improvement ? ”
50521	50528	50529	50529	She	1817	“ Cameron did , my dear . ”
50540	50547	50529	50529	She	1817	“ Oh ! Hello , Cameron ! ”
50548	50554	50555	50555	She	1817	“ Hullo , Mrs. Dinwiddle . ”
50560	50574	50555	50555	She	1817	“ Are you all right , my dear ? Your face looks funny . ”
50585	50589	50580	50580	Cam	366	“ Intestinal gas . ”
50613	50638	50597	50597	I	94	“ I ’ve got something for that , my dear . I ’ll have Blessica bring it over , along with my makeup kit . ”
50639	50644	50645	50645	I	94	“ Your makeup kit ? ”
50654	50662	50663	50663	she	884	“ We ’re giving you a makeover ! ”
50672	50734	50663	50663	she	884	“ Now that Michael is getting divorced , we have to move quickly . We do n’t want another girl snapping him up . And forgive me , Ducky , but I thought you might need professional help with your hair and makeup . It ’s Friday night , so we ’ll have plenty of time to experiment with different looks . ”
50782	50806	50864	50864	His	370	“ Um . That ’s really nice of you , Mrs. Dinwiddle , but I ’m not sure that ’s a good idea . ”
50807	50812	50813	50813	She	886	“ Pssh ! Poppycock ! ”
50830	50845	50813	50813	She	886	“ It ’s a capital idea ! Do n’t you think so , Cameron ? ”
50846	50863	50813	50813	She	886	“ Sure . We want her to look her best for Michael , do n’t we ? ”
50891	50894	50886	50887	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Exactly ! ”
50895	50909	50910	50910	I	94	“ Well , fine . If Cam thinks it ’s a good idea . ”
50942	50950	50934	50934	She	886	“ Why would n’t he , Ducky ? ”
51003	51017	51048	51048	His	366	“ Actually , I was just about to make dinner , Mrs. Dinwiddle — ”
51018	51021	51023	51023	Cam	366	“ No , ”
51032	51047	51023	51023	Cam	366	“ You girls have a good night . I ’ve got things to do . ”
51052	51061	51048	51048	His	366	“ I ’ve got better things to do , ”
51155	51165	51139	51139	She	890	“ Ignore him , Ducky . Men are children . ”
51169	51179	51166	51166	I	94	“ Some of them are more like juvenile delinquents . ”
51185	51204	51180	51180	Her	890	“ Now , while we wait for Blessica , let ’s go through your closet , shall we ? ”
51291	51299	51274	51274	she	891	“ Good God , what is this ? ”
51404	51412	51414	51415	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ What do you think , Ducky ? ”
51439	51458	51431	51431	she	1817	“ I think it ’s perfect . If I ’m starring in a play about a Kabuki warrior . ”
51494	51497	51484	51484	I	94	“ Ow . ”
51593	51604	51606	51606	God	1890	“ Joellen ! Are you in there ? Open up ! ”
51690	51702	51682	51682	Cam	366	“ Sweet mother Mary ! What the hell happened to you ? ”
51706	51713	51703	51703	I	94	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle happened to me . ”
51714	51721	51682	51682	Cam	366	“ Did you lose a bet ? ”
51722	51732	51733	51733	I	94	“ Ha . Go away — your voice hurts . ”
51773	51794	51760	51760	I	94	“ Do me a favor and feed the cat . I ’m hungover . I ’m going back to bed . ”
51795	51800	51842	51842	He	366	“ For how long ? ”
51801	51804	51760	51760	I	94	“ Forever . ”
51805	51811	51842	51842	He	366	“ What about our workout ? ”
51823	51841	51815	51815	I	94	“ In case you had n’t noticed , I ’m in no condition to exercise , prancer . ”
51851	51872	51842	51842	He	366	“ You have a point . It might be dangerous to allow you in public — you’ll frighten the children . ”
51886	51898	51873	51873	I	94	“ Cat food ’s on the third shelf in the pantry . ”
51951	51957	51958	51958	I	94	“ What ’re you doing ? ”
51990	51999	51980	51980	He	366	“ Gettin ’ this shit off your face . ”
52025	52054	52000	52000	He	366	“ Stop frownin ’ . I ’m doin’ you a solid here , lass . I think your poor cat is traumatized from seein ’ you like this . ”
52055	52062	52000	52000	He	366	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle had good intentions . ”
52063	52070	52000	52000	He	366	“ Or she secretly hates you . ”
52076	52091	52073	52073	me	94	“ I ’m glad to hear you do n’t think it was an improvement . ”
52105	52112	52187	52187	he	366	“ You do n’t need makeup . ”
52121	52154	52113	52113	I	94	“ News alert : you need to see an optometrist . I do n’t normally wear makeup , but I definitely should . My bare skin has caused many a man nightmares . ”
52164	52182	52155	52155	Cam	366	“ You ’ve got a head full o ’ bullshit , lass . Your skin is beautiful . ”
52228	52241	52223	52223	His	366	“ Do you always freak out when someone pays you a compliment ? ”
52242	52249	52223	52223	His	366	“ I ’m not freaking out . ”
52250	52286	52287	52287	He	366	“ Oh , no ? Then why did your entire body go stiff ? And your eyes are rollin ’ around under your eyelids . You look like you ’re gettin ’ electric shock therapy . ”
52390	52400	52380	52380	I	94	“ Do you really think I have beautiful skin ? ”
52423	52431	52419	52419	he	366	“ You do n’t even have pores . ”
52432	52439	52401	52401	He	366	“ But I ’m so pasty . ”
52440	52452	52419	52419	he	366	“ Ha ! You wanna see pasty , come to Scotland . ”
52453	52461	52401	52401	He	366	“ Oh . So that explains it . ”
52468	52523	52462	52462	He	366	“ I do n’t know what kind of demented BS is about to leave your mouth , lass , but lemme just say this . Your skin is n’t the only beautiful thing about you . If you were n’t such a wee numpty , you ’d realize what a braw bird you are . ”
52545	52552	52531	52531	I	94	“ Um . . . thanks ? ”
52553	52558	52559	52559	he	366	“ Close your eyes , ”
52565	52578	52559	52559	he	366	“ I ’ve got ta get all the goop off your lashes . ”
52579	52596	52597	52597	He	366	“ I think you just pull those off . Be gentle — there was glue involved . ”
52600	52603	52597	52597	He	366	“ Jesus . ”
52656	52667	52653	52653	he	366	“ You did n’t eat last night , did you ? ”
52694	52718	52684	52684	His	366	“ All right , lass . I ’m gon na make you somethin’ to drink , and then I ’ll let you sleep . ”
52772	52777	52778	52778	I	94	“ What ’s that ? ”
52782	52805	52778	52778	I	94	“ Homemade hangover cure . Drink it all , sleep for a few hours , and you ’ll be right as rain . ”
52838	52845	52846	52846	He	366	“ What the hell is this ? ”
52851	52862	52846	52846	He	366	“ Butt crack juice . Sourced fresh this mornin ’ . ”
52919	52931	52897	52897	He	366	“ I ’ll see you later , lassie . Sweet dreams . ”
53133	53145	53121	53121	I	94	“ It should say blue . Michael ’s eyes are blue . ”
53226	53235	53236	53236	I	94	“ He put something funny in that drink , ”
53241	53246	53236	53236	I	94	“ What ’s that ? ”
53266	53275	53258	53258	Cam	366	“ Nothing ! What are you doing here ? ”
53284	53298	53276	53276	He	366	“ Watchin ’ ESPN with the cat . Why ’re you shoutin ’ ? ”
53310	53316	53307	53307	I	94	“ I ’m not shouting ! ”
53339	53352	53353	53353	His	366	“ Uh - huh . That did n’t look guilty at all . ”
53382	53388	53362	53362	I	94	“ I thought you left . ”
53389	53394	53395	53395	He	366	“ You thought wrong . ”
53434	53451	53362	53362	I	94	“ Okay , I ’ll let it go . For now . How ’d you sleep ? ”
53452	53477	53424	53424	He	366	“ Fine . Amazing , actually . I should n’t feel this good after all that wine . What was in your homemade potion ? ”
53478	53498	53362	53362	I	94	“ It ’s a secret . I could tell you , but then I ’d have to kill you . ”
53511	53541	53508	53508	he	366	“ Ginger , raw honey , flaxseed , red pepper flakes , lemon juice , B vitamins , other stuff . Whips up in the blender in no time . ”
53542	53554	53604	53604	He	366	“ You ’re quite the blender master , are n’t you ? ”
53555	53567	53508	53508	he	366	“ It was my mum ’s recipe . They all are . ”
53587	53593	53594	53594	I	94	“ What time is it ? ”
53624	53634	53604	53604	He	366	“ Ten . You got anything planned for today ? ”
53635	53638	53604	53604	He	366	“ Nope . ”
53639	53648	53649	53649	He	366	“ Good . We ’re goin’ shoppin ’ . ”
53661	53664	53665	53665	I	94	“ Shopping ? ”
53674	53684	53665	53665	I	94	“ We already bought enough food for a month — ”
53685	53700	53649	53649	He	366	“ Not for food , lass . For a dress for the holiday party . ”
53714	53738	53711	53711	he	366	“ Unless you do n’t want a man ’s opinion on the matter . I ’m sure whatever you pick will be nice . ”
53778	53797	53765	53765	I	94	“ I mean , if you do n’t have anything better to do , that would be great . ”
53808	53818	53798	53798	His	907	“ I do n’t have anything better to do . ”
53839	53851	53832	53832	he	366	“ Um . Okay . I need to take a shower . ”
53852	53868	53912	53912	his	366	“ I ’ll go change out of my sweats . How much time d’you need ? ”
53869	53873	53832	53832	he	366	“ Twenty minutes . ”
53874	53879	53912	53912	his	366	“ That ’s it ? ”
53880	53888	53832	53832	he	366	“ Why do you look so surprised ? ”
53889	53908	53912	53912	his	366	“ Nothin’ . Just in my experience women usually take a lot longer than that to get ready . ”
53913	53915	53912	53912	his	366	“ experience ”
53941	53954	53938	53938	Cam	366	“ You ’ve got that intestinal gas look again , darlin ’ . ”
53955	53967	53938	53938	Cam	366	“ I ’ll knock on your door when I ’m ready . ”
54114	54123	54124	54124	I	94	“ God , how do you stand it ? ”
54178	54182	54184	54184	Cam	366	“ Stand what ? ”
54232	54236	54237	54237	I	94	“ The ogling . ”
54291	54298	54299	54299	he	366	“ I hardly notice it anymore , ”
54320	54324	54325	54325	He	366	“ This one . ”
54348	54369	54334	54334	I	94	“ Seriously , though , it must get annoying ! The amount of attention you get does n’t bother you ? ”
54370	54389	54390	54390	He	366	“ Comes with the territory , lass . This kind of rare , extraordinary beauty has a price . ”
54401	54431	54390	54390	He	366	“ God , I ’m glad I ’m not beautiful . I ’d wind up a hermit if I had to deal with this every time I went out . ”
54471	54491	54492	54492	he	366	“ The only reason you do n’t have to deal with it is because you do n’t notice it , ”
54499	54524	54492	54492	he	366	“ And the only reason you do n’t notice it is because you ’ve mind fucked yourself into thinking you ’re fat and plain . ”
54548	54573	54574	54574	he	366	“ Since we walked into this store , I ’ve seen at least half a dozen men looking at you . Yes , you , ”
54582	54616	54574	54574	he	366	“ If you want an example of what I ’m talkin ’ about , look to your right . Three o’clock . Lad in the leather jacket with the red scarf . Look . ”
54702	54708	54709	54709	I	94	“ It must be you , ”
54714	54758	54709	54709	I	94	“ I ’m getting some of your glow . Like the moon reflecting the sun ’s rays . If the sun did n’t shine so brightly , the moon would just sit there in the night sky like a dead lump of rock . ”
54765	54770	54771	54771	he	366	“ Bloody fucking hell , ”
54898	54916	54885	54885	I	94	“ What you ’re failing to take away from my comment is the compliment I paid you . ”
54926	54941	54917	54917	He	926	“ Do n’t talk to me right now . I ’m mad at you . ”
54983	54988	54989	54989	I	94	“ Oh , okay , ”
55011	55023	54989	54989	I	94	“ So it ’s no biggie that I called you beautiful . ”
55033	55040	55024	55024	He	926	“ No , you did n’t . ”
55041	55046	55047	55047	I	94	“ Did n’t I ? ”
55080	55083	55084	55084	he	366	“ When ? ”
55099	55109	55110	55110	I	94	“ Use that big brain of yours and think . ”
55147	55166	55139	55139	Cam	366	“ You said you were glad you were n’t beautiful . How is that a compliment to me ? ”
55167	55176	55139	55139	Cam	366	“ Because it ’s implied that you are . ”
55187	55203	55177	55177	He	366	“ No . A negative does n’t count . You ca n’t prove a negative . ”
55276	55291	55261	55261	Cam	366	“ So what you ’re sayin ’ is that you think I ’m beautiful ? ”
55312	55324	55292	55292	I	94	“ Well . . . you ’re not entirely unfortunate looking . ”
55352	55371	55325	55325	He	366	“ It ’s a yes - or - no question , Joellen . So — yes or no ? ”
55380	55390	55415	55415	his	366	“ You know exactly how you look , McGregor . ”
55391	55411	55325	55325	He	366	“ Beauty ’s in the eye of the beholder , lass . I dunno how I look to you . ”
55524	55628	55520	55520	I	94	“ To me you look like a man everyone underestimates , objectifies , and misjudges because of his appearance . To me you look like a man who ’s thoughtful , insightful , and kind , but hopes no one will notice because it will be mistaken for weakness . To me you look like a man who hides his pain behind smiles and buries it in women and tries everything he can to forget whatever ’s hurting him but ca n’t because he ’s got a soft heart that scars easily , but no one has ever looked close enough to see . ”
55776	55780	55757	55757	Cam	366	“ Was that — ”
55781	55787	55757	55757	Cam	366	“ Aye . C’m on . ”
55836	55842	55843	55843	Cam	366	“ She needs a room , ”
55846	55856	55843	55843	Cam	366	“ and I need to speak to your manager . ”
55927	55935	55936	55936	I	94	“ Are you going crazy , Joellen ? ”
55961	55975	55945	55945	I	94	“ Get it together . Your imagination is running away with you again . ”
56060	56063	56064	56064	I	94	“ Stupid , ”
56075	56126	56064	56064	I	94	“ Stupid , stupid , stupid . One man shows you some attention , and now you think they all want you . Cam was not going to kiss you ! And he probably paid that guy in the leather jacket to stare at you , because he ’s nice ! ”
56159	56183	56156	56156	Lucky	160	“ Be grateful the poor guy ’s helping you out , for Pete ’s sake , and stop acting like such a dimwit ! ”
56220	56223	56235	56235	I	94	“ Oh . ”
56375	56383	56384	56384	I	94	“ You should definitely wear more red , ”
56407	56424	56384	56384	I	94	“ Is everything all right in there , miss ? Do you need any different sizes ? ”
56436	56453	56425	56425	I	94	“ Um , would you happen to have any heels I can try on with this ? ”
56462	56481	56454	56455	The salesgirl	953	“ Wow , that looks like it was made for you ! What shoe size do you wear ? ”
56509	56518	56519	56519	I	94	“ I ’ll break my leg in those , ”
56530	56549	56497	56497	she	953	“ Honey , if you ’re gon na go for it , go for broke . Metaphorically speaking . ”
56602	56611	56612	56613	the salesgirl	953	“ Your boyfriend ’s gon na love it , ”
56618	56626	56612	56613	the salesgirl	953	“ Oh , he ’s not my — ”
56688	56693	56694	56694	he	366	“ Here she is ! ”
56729	56733	56716	56716	He	366	“ Holy shit , ”
56784	56792	56793	56793	He	366	“ Is it . . . okay ? ”
56815	56818	56806	56806	He	366	“ Yup . ”
56819	56826	56827	56827	I	94	“ Yup ? That ’s it ? ”
56861	56864	56854	56854	I	94	“ Joellen . ”
56880	56883	56865	56865	Cam	366	“ Huh ? ”
56909	56920	56901	56901	he	366	“ You . Look . Sexy . As . Fuck . ”
56943	56960	56906	56906	he	366	“ Right ? I told her the same thing ! I mean , not exactly the same thing”—she
56965	56976	56906	56906	he	366	noise—“but you know what I mean . She looks fantastic ! ”
57009	57025	56999	56999	his	366	“ So . . . um . . . you think Michael will like it ? ”
57063	57079	57054	57054	she	953	“ Excuse me , folks , there ’s someone who needs my help . . . ”
57095	57103	57091	57091	Cam	366	“ Aye . He ’ll like it . ”
57104	57110	57091	57091	Cam	366	“ Are you mad again ? ”
57111	57125	57091	57091	Cam	366	“ Do n’t be silly , lass . Why would I be mad ? ”
57149	57163	57191	57192	Oh boy	92	“ It ’s just that . . . you seem a little mad . ”
57180	57190	57164	57164	He	366	“ I ’m . Not . Bloody . Mad . ”
57269	57272	57260	57260	Cam	366	“ Lass . ”
57273	57276	57260	57260	Cam	366	“ Yeah ? ”
57277	57285	57260	57260	Cam	366	“ Try the black one , too . ”
57291	57298	57286	57286	I	94	“ Maybe we should just go — ”
57299	57309	57310	57310	he	366	“ Try the black one , too , woman ! ”
57318	57327	57328	57328	I	94	“ You ’re not the boss of me , ”
57349	57363	57344	57345	a woman	370	“ I ’d sure let him be the boss of me , sister ! ”
57447	57461	57439	57439	I	94	“ Stop hidin ’ , lass . You ’re not ten years old . ”
57462	57465	57439	57439	I	94	“ Ugh . ”
57466	57471	57439	57439	I	94	“ Look at me . ”
57487	57492	57439	57439	I	94	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
57493	57502	57439	57439	I	94	“ You ’re making me self - conscious . ”
57503	57506	57439	57439	I	94	“ Why ? ”
57507	57518	57439	57439	I	94	“ Because you look like you ’re about to puke ! ”
57553	57556	57519	57519	He	366	“ Lass . ”
57557	57560	57574	57574	I	94	“ What ? ”
57561	57573	57519	57519	He	366	“ What you know about men would n’t fill a teaspoon . ”
57598	57610	57611	57611	He	366	“ I do n’t know what that ’s supposed to mean . ”
57629	57642	57626	57626	He	366	“ For the love of all that ’s holy , this woman . ”
57643	57656	57611	57611	He	366	“ Excuse me , sir , did you ask to see me ? ”
57689	57698	57683	57683	Cam	366	“ Aye . Let ’s talk over there . ”
58196	58211	58168	58168	he	325	“ What do you think , Mr. Bingley ? Should I go over there ? ”
58262	58265	58266	58266	I	94	“ Cam ? ”

58827	58833	58824	58824	He	366	“ Stay where you are . ”
58943	58952	58958	58958	his	366	“ Why would you think I was robbed ? ”
58976	58998	58958	58958	his	366	“ Your door was open . There was some clothing on the floor . . . a smashed glass . . . ”
59035	59054	59028	59028	his	366	“ I ’ve got a sheet wrapped around me , lass , you can stop hidin ’ now . ”
59060	59083	59055	59055	I	94	“ I ’m too busy plotting my disappearance . Do you think Jane Smith is a good name for an assumed identity ? ”
59118	59122	59123	59123	he	366	“ Too obvious , ”
59126	59146	59147	59147	He	366	“ You should go with somethin’ more exotic . Like Beatrix . Or Seraphina . Yeah , Seraphina Snufflebottom . ”
59192	59200	59206	59206	He	366	“ I was n’t robbed , Seraphina . ”
59201	59205	59246	59246	I	94	“ No kidding . ”
59223	59245	59206	59206	He	366	“ Had too much to drink last night . Must ’ve passed out . It ’s a bit of a blur . ”
59382	59394	59426	59426	Idiot	226	“ Where are you goin’ in such a rush , Seraphina ? ”
59395	59425	59426	59426	Idiot	226	“ For a run . See you . Sorry again , it was an accident . I ’m just a . . . I ’m such a . . . ”
59770	59851	59852	59852	I	94	“ Oh , you ’ll take me over your knee , will you ? Hmpf . I ’m sure it ’s a popular spot . I hope you ’ve got some industrial - strength sanitizer ready , because there ’s no way I ’m going over your knee without it ! Good luck with that , buddy ! Wait . What am I talking about ? I ’m not going over your knee at all ! You dang man whore ! ”
59905	59914	59915	59915	I	94	“ Not that I can really blame you , ”
59920	59940	59915	59915	I	94	“ You ’re single , you ’re young , you ’re famous , you ’re . . . big . ”
59945	59994	59915	59915	I	94	“ Why should n’t you take advantage of your situation ? In all fairness , why should n’t you sleep around ? I mean , If I had men throwing themselves into my path every three feet , I ’m sure I ’d be a whore , too ! ”
59995	59999	60003	60003	me	94	“ Oh really ? ”

60112	60142	60096	60096	I	94	“ You . . . you jerk ! You ca n’t just waltz in here unannounced any time you like ! This is my home ! My private home ! ”
60143	60166	60211	60211	he	94	“ As I recall , you waltzed into my place unannounced only a few hours ago . At least you ’re clothed . ”
60179	60183	60167	60167	His	94	“ Get out ! ”
60184	60187	60096	60096	I	94	“ No . ”

60218	60241	60211	60211	he	94	“ A question for you , Miss Snufflebottom : Why would you care if I did have a woman in my bathroom ? ”
60242	60255	60211	60211	he	94	“ I would n’t ! I did n’t ! I do n’t ! ”
60268	60280	60264	60264	He	94	“ What did I tell you about lyin ’ to me ? ”
60314	60324	60291	60291	he	94	“ Cam . Stop . Whatever you ’re thinking — ”
60325	60337	60338	60338	His	94	“ You know exactly what I ’m thinkin ’ , lass . ”
60416	60426	60400	60400	he	94	“ Cut it out ! This is n’t funny ! ”
60427	60439	60440	60440	His	94	“ I ’d stop if I thought you were really scared . ”
60449	60460	60444	60444	he	94	“ Are you scared , lass ? Tell the truth . ”
60479	60486	60476	60476	He	94	“ That was n’t a yes . ”
60560	60567	60557	60557	I	94	“ I actually am pretty scared . ”
60583	60591	60568	60568	He	94	“ But not one hundred percent scared . ”
60599	60605	60592	60592	I	94	“ What ’s your point ? ”
60619	60632	60606	60606	His	94	“ My point is . . . what ’s the other percentage ? ”
60651	60654	60633	60633	I	94	“ Twelve . ”
60655	60658	60663	60663	his	94	“ Twelve ? ”

60772	60801	60769	60769	he	366	“ I had a meetin ’ with one o ’ my attorneys last night , lass . I came home alone . Not that you care , right ? ”
60987	60992	60993	60993	he	366	“ Hullo , lassie , ”
61000	61006	61007	61007	He	366	“ What brings you by ? ”
61050	61058	61059	61059	I	94	“ I have n’t forgotten our bargain . ”
61067	61079	61059	61059	I	94	“ Pasta primavera with a garden salad . Here you go . ”
61092	61102	61080	61080	He	366	“ Here I go ? Here I go where ? ”
61108	61115	61103	61103	My	94	“ Take your food , prancer . ”
61116	61151	61152	61152	He	366	“ Oh , no . No , no , no . Our deal was that you make me food and I eat it over at your place . Forty - five minutes , remember ? ”
61170	61188	61152	61152	He	366	“ Or would you prefer to spend your evenin ’ with my good friend Ol’ Dirty Bastard ? ”
61325	61328	61317	61317	She	340	“ Hello ? ”
61329	61338	61339	61339	I	94	“ Hey , Mom . It ’s Joellen . ”
61365	61379	61353	61353	she	340	“ Oh , hi , honey ! I was just thinking about you ! ”
61380	61387	61419	61419	Cam	366	“ Why ? What ’s wrong ? ”
61391	61412	61388	61388	She	340	“ Nothing ’s wrong , silly , I was just thinking I ’d call you tonight . How are you ? ”
61422	61433	61419	61419	Cam	366	“ You better not be skippin ’ dinner , lass ! ”
61443	61459	61434	61434	I	94	“ I ’m good . Great , actually . I got a raise at work . ”
61460	61469	61470	61470	She	340	“ Oh , honey , that ’s wonderful ! ”
61479	61489	61470	61470	She	340	“ Plus , I ’m up for a promotion . ”
61490	61496	61470	61470	She	340	“ A promotion , too ? ”
61497	61519	61470	61470	She	340	“ For an associate editor position . I already put the application in . I ’m just waiting to hear back . ”
61520	61530	61470	61470	She	340	“ That ’s fantastic ! When will you know ? ”
61537	61551	61531	61531	Cam	366	“ Is that your mother , lass ? Tell her I said hullo ! ”
61586	61608	61576	61576	you	1014	“ Probably soon , maybe next week ? I ’ll call you as soon as I know . How ’s Dad ? ”
61609	61616	61619	61619	Mother	161	“ Who ’s that with you ? ”
61652	61655	61647	61650	the Incredibly Irritating Man	1017	“ Hmm ? ”
61656	61665	61576	61576	you	1014	“ I heard someone ’s voice , honey . ”
61666	61679	61647	61650	the Incredibly Irritating Man	1017	“ It ’s the TV . I ’ve got the news on . ”
61680	61688	61576	61576	you	1014	“ So it ’s not Cameron McGregor ? ”
61700	61711	61692	61692	her	161	“ No , Mother , it ’s not Cameron McGregor . ”
61717	61727	61692	61692	her	161	“ I can hear you talkin ’ about me ! ”
61779	61799	61968	61968	I	94	“ Listen , I wanted to apologize for that remark I made about him the last time we spoke . ”
61810	61823	61800	61800	I	94	“ Forget about it , Mom . I was just being sensitive . ”
61830	61842	61800	61800	I	94	“ I feel like we ’re talking about two different things . ”
61843	61866	61800	61800	I	94	“ I ’m talking about when you said a man like him could n’t fall in love with a girl like me . ”
61872	61934	61935	61935	She	1975	“ Oh , honey , let ’s not go over that again . It ’s just reality . Everyone has to box in his own weight class , as your father would say . Birds of a feather and whatnot . What I ’m talking about is when I called him a sex object . That was a little . . . ”
61939	61967	61935	61935	She	1975	“ I ca n’t call myself a feminist if I ’m guilty of the same thing men are always doing to women . Namely , objectifying them . ”
62021	62024	62000	62000	she	1975	“ Mom . ”
62025	62030	62000	62000	she	1975	“ Yes , honey ? ”
62031	62054	62000	62000	she	1975	“ I know I ’m not beautiful like you and Jacqueline , but sometimes you make me feel really shitty about it . ”
62059	62068	62055	62055	She	1023	“ What on earth are you talking about ? ”
62096	62172	62000	62000	she	1975	“ I ’m talking about boxing in my own weight class ! I ’m talking about how you like to make ‘ jokes ’ about me not being a size two like you guys ! Calling me ‘ plumpy ’ is n’t an affectionate nickname , it ’s a personal attack ! And just because I ’m not tall and willowy and blonde does n’t mean I ’ll never feel the touch of a man — ”
62173	62176	62271	62271	She	1026	“ Joellen ! ”
62177	62185	62000	62000	she	1975	“ — or deserve to be loved — ”
62186	62193	62271	62271	She	1026	“ Now wait just a minute ! ”
62194	62253	62000	62000	she	1975	“ — or get treated with respect by my family , the ones who I ’m supposed to be able to trust and be myself with . I ’ve had total strangers say nicer things to me than you do ! Somebody told me the other day I have beautiful skin , and I almost fainted from shock ! ”
62254	62270	62271	62271	She	1026	“ Of course you have beautiful skin , sweetie ! You get it from me ! ”
62330	62340	62322	62322	I	94	“ Okay . Good talk , Mom . Later . ”
62367	62384	62357	62358	Mr. Bingley	370	“ You love me no matter how I look , do n’t you , Mr. Bingley ? ”
62464	62469	62451	62451	Cam	366	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
62495	62504	62484	62485	Mr. Bingley	370	“ Can I ask you a serious question ? ”
62505	62515	62484	62485	Mr. Bingley	370	“ Of course , lass . Ask me anything . ”
62516	62524	62484	62485	Mr. Bingley	370	“ Is life easier , being beautiful ? ”
62538	62552	62553	62553	I	94	“ Yes , fine , I ’m admitting I think you ’re beautiful . ”
62566	62586	62553	62553	I	94	“ You look like you were carved from a perfect piece of marble by a master sculptor . Happy ? ”
62600	62611	62596	62596	he	366	“ Who were you talkin ’ to on the phone ? ”
62612	62624	62596	62596	he	366	“ My mother . Are you going to answer my question ? ”
62649	62665	62596	62596	he	366	“ All right . Here ’s your answer : my life has never been easy . ”
62679	62694	62672	62672	someone	325	“ Really ? Because from where I ’m sitting , it looks pretty good . ”
62699	62705	62695	62695	His	366	“ Aye ? How so ? ”
62706	62757	62808	62808	He	366	“ C’m on , McGregor . You ’re famous . You ’re good - looking . You ’re probably super rich . You ’ve got your pick of women — and men , by the looks of it . For you the world is just one big banquet of choices . ”
62758	62762	62695	62695	His	366	“ Is it ? ”
62763	62768	62808	62808	He	366	“ Is n’t it ? ”
62794	62807	62791	62791	he	366	“ What did she say that hurt your feelin ’s this time ? ”
62814	62817	62808	62808	He	366	“ this . ”
62883	62886	62913	62913	God	1890	“ Joellen . ”
62969	63030	62966	62966	he	1032	“ People can be arseholes . Sometimes those arseholes are family . It sucks , but it does n’t mean you have to take on their bullshit . Your mother ’s BS is about her , not you . You ’re perfect just the way you are , lass . Anyone who tells you different is a stupid bloody arsebadger . ”
63132	63159	63174	63174	NINETEEN	234	“ Ah , lassie . If it were anyone else but family who made you cry like this , they ’d already be in an ambulance . ”
63311	63318	63320	63320	he	1032	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
63514	63526	63496	63496	He	366	“ C’m on out , lassie . I ’ve got treats . ”
63554	63557	63558	63558	I	94	“ Treats ? ”
63566	63574	63558	63558	I	94	“ Chocolate ice cream drizzled with Kahlúa . ”
63592	63595	63582	63582	I	94	“ Gimme . ”
63596	63603	63604	63604	He	366	“ No , we ’re sharing . ”
63692	63695	63696	63696	I	94	“ S’good , ”
63705	63714	63696	63696	I	94	“ But it ’s not on my diet . ”
63715	63725	63726	63726	He	366	“ That ’s why it ’s called a treat . ”
63760	63790	63754	63754	him	366	“ Food is fuel , but it ’s also comfort . The trouble happens when it becomes more comfort than fuel . But that ’s what hugs are for . ”
63807	63819	63791	63791	He	366	“ You ’re a very good hugger , by the way . ”
63820	63824	63791	63791	He	366	“ I know . ”
63831	63847	63848	63848	He	366	“ But am I a good kisser ? That ’s the real question , lass . ”
63862	63880	63791	63791	He	366	“ You waited until I was in a vulnerable state to ask that , did n’t you ? ”
63881	63890	63891	63891	He	366	“ I ’m not that stealthy . Here . ”
63940	63946	63936	63936	I	94	“ You seem very experienced . ”
63952	63958	63947	63947	He	366	“ That ’s awfully clinical . ”
63959	63987	63947	63947	He	366	“ Oh , I ’m sorry , is your ego throwing a tantrum because I did n’t say it was the hottest kiss I ’ve ever had ? ”
64011	64015	63988	63988	He	366	“ Was it ? ”
64037	64047	64022	64022	I	94	“ It might . . . be up there . ”
64070	64078	64079	64079	I	94	“ Oh , shut up , prancer , ”
64095	64111	64082	64082	He	366	“ For the record , it might ’ve been up there for me , too . ”
64124	64127	64112	64112	I	94	“ Really ? ”
64128	64131	64082	64082	He	366	“ Really . ”
64139	64150	64132	64132	I	94	“ You ’re just trying to make me feel better . ”
64151	64155	64156	64156	He	366	“ Am I ? ”
64193	64227	64184	64184	I	94	“ I ’m tellin ’ the truth , lass . You ’re a champion kisser . Very fine . And not fine the way you Yanks use it — fine as in excellent . ”
64241	64262	64263	64263	he	366	“ I do n’t mean to make it sound like I do n’t have anything else I could teach you , ”
64277	64284	64271	64271	He	366	“ For Michael , of course . ”
64293	64297	64285	64285	I	94	“ Like what ? ”
64298	64304	64263	64263	he	366	“ You want a list ? ”
64310	64333	64306	64306	I	94	“ A list ? There ’s that much to improve on ? I thought you said it was fine as in excellent ! ”
64393	64415	64380	64380	I	94	“ Okay . Hit me . And do n’t leave anything out . I want to hear the whole ugly truth . ”
64433	64448	64416	64416	He	366	“ It ’s not really one of those things you can talk someone through . ”
64460	64469	64455	64455	I	94	“ So how am I supposed to improve ? ”
64499	64502	64477	64477	His	366	“ Practice . ”
64550	64565	64547	64547	I	94	“ So you ’re saying . . . you want to kiss me again . ”
64566	64579	64580	64580	he	366	“ I wanna help you get your heart ’s desire , lass , ”
64584	64591	64580	64580	he	366	“ Which is Michael , right ? ”
64602	64614	64597	64597	I	94	“ Um . Yes . It ’s . . . Michael . ”
64631	64702	64620	64620	he	366	“ Right . Think of it as trainin ’ . Like if you were gon na run a marathon , you would n’t just run twenty - odd miles in one go . You ’d work up to it a bit at a time . Day after day , week after week , a wee bit at a time , until you ’re in prime shape for the big event . ”
64722	64786	64717	64717	Cam	366	“ You ’re right . It ’s a bad idea . You ’ll get all attached , and it ’ll be funny between us . You ’ll be heartsick . I ’ll be uncomfortable . You do n’t know this , but it ’s not easy for me to break a lass ’s heart . I can only stand so much beggin ’ — ”
64787	64796	64717	64717	Cam	366	“ Oh for fuck ’s sake , McGregor ! ”
64806	64834	64797	64797	He	366	“ I ’m just tryin ’ to spare you a broken heart , lassie . I ’m agreein ’ with you , it ’s a terrible idea . ”
64835	64858	64717	64717	Cam	366	“ I ’m not going to fall in love with you , McGregor . Not from kissing you or from anything else . ”
64881	64898	64864	64864	he	366	“ Oh , aye , now I remember . You said I ’m not your type . ”
64899	64902	64903	64903	I	94	“ Exactly . ”
64924	64934	64921	64921	Cam	366	“ Exactly . So then there ’s no problem . ”
65018	65044	65045	65045	Cam	366	“ Fine . But this is purely . . . educational . And I do n’t want to talk about it after tonight . Deal ? ”
65055	65069	65045	65045	Cam	366	“ Whatever you say , lass . I ’m just here to help . ”
65089	65097	65075	65075	his	366	“ Okay . Let ’s do this . ”
65098	65101	65102	65102	He	366	“ Sure . ”
65110	65119	65075	65075	his	366	“ Are you coming in here or what ? ”
65120	65129	65075	65075	his	366	“ I ’m comfortable right where I am . ”
65130	65137	65138	65138	I	94	“ Oh . Um . Okay . ”
65186	65194	65183	65183	Cam	366	“ Well , hop on , then . ”
65195	65198	65183	65183	Cam	366	“ What ? ”
65208	65220	65183	65183	Cam	366	“ Dude ! No way ! I ’m not straddling you ! ”
65224	65241	65221	65221	He	366	“ Afraid you ’ll get too hot and bothered and rip my shirt off , lass ? ”
65242	65247	65199	65199	He	366	“ This is ridiculous . ”
65248	65260	65221	65221	He	366	“ Oh , so you ’re worried I ’ll get aroused . ”
65274	65283	65271	65271	I	94	“ W - what ? No ! Geez ! ”
65284	65319	65221	65221	He	366	“ Good , because I wo n’t . Stop stallin ’ . I ’ve got ta get to bed soon . I ’m meetin ’ someone for a run early in the mornin ’ . ”
65349	65352	65353	65353	Cam	366	“ Who ? ”
65374	65377	65353	65353	Cam	366	“ You . ”
65378	65391	65353	65353	Cam	366	“ Oh . Right . I mean . . . I know . ”
65408	65417	65402	65402	he	366	“ You ’re adorable when you ’re jealous . ”
65426	65432	65418	65418	I	94	“ I am not jealous ! ”
65487	65535	65483	65483	Cam	366	“ Good . It ’s sorted . You ’re not jealous , I ’m not your type , and you do n’t have eyes for anyone but pretty boy Michael . Now quit yammerin ’ , woman , because I ’ve got other plans for that mouth . ”
65613	65616	65608	65608	I	94	“ Wait ! ”
65629	65632	65617	65617	He	366	“ What ? ”
65685	65690	65691	65691	he	366	“ Remember to breathe , ”
65694	65700	65701	65701	I	94	“ Just kiss me already , ”
65715	65722	65701	65701	I	94	“ Your eyes are still open . ”
65738	65751	65752	65752	He	366	“ If only you were that obedient all the time , lass . ”
66041	66046	66047	66047	I	94	“ How’m I doing ? ”
66071	66077	66078	66078	he	366	“ Jury ’s still out , ”
66085	66090	66078	66078	he	366	“ Need more evidence . ”
66212	66221	66208	66208	he	366	“ You ca n’t make noises like that . ”
66247	66250	66234	66236	A trained pig	1054	“ Okay . ”
66263	66277	66257	66257	his	366	“ It ’s not bad . It ’s just . . . distracting . ”
66317	66326	66314	66314	I	94	“ You said you would n’t get aroused . ”
66344	66348	66327	66327	He	366	“ I lied . ”
66481	66488	66489	66489	He	366	“ Fuck . Joellen . Fuck . ”
66592	66597	66598	66598	I	94	“ Do n’t stop , ”
66605	66611	66598	66598	I	94	“ You taste so good . ”
66644	66652	66641	66641	He	366	“ You like the way I taste ? ”
66780	66783	66784	66784	I	94	“ Sorry , ”
66797	66807	66792	66792	I	94	“ I think I got a little carried away . ”
66891	66901	66902	66902	I	94	“ So I ’ll see you in the morning ? ”
66930	66940	66923	66923	He	366	“ Yup . See you in the mornin ’ . ”
67086	67127	67083	67083	I	94	“ Hey , that was some great kissing last night , eh ? Wow , I sure was grinding on that king cobra in your pants ! Had to go to bed and rub one out — how ’bout you ? ”
67288	67291	67292	67292	he	71	“ Yikes ! ”
67297	67316	67292	67292	he	71	“ Is that stench the roses , or did you have chili and beans for dinner last night ? ”
67333	67342	67365	67365	He	71	“ Do you want me to help you ? ”
67343	67361	67365	67365	He	71	“ No , kiddo , I got it . Thanks . You want to keep the vase ? ”
67414	67430	67410	67410	Shasta	125	“ Oh my God . What the . . . Joellen ? Is this you ? ”
67470	67476	67459	67459	her	125	“ Is this me where ? ”
67477	67481	67482	67482	She	125	“ On TMZ . ”
67490	67496	67482	67482	She	125	“ You ’re on TMZ . ”
67497	67500	67501	67501	I	94	“ Me ? ”
67506	67513	67501	67501	I	94	“ I do n’t think so . ”
67533	67553	67514	67514	She	125	“ Then you ’ve got a twin you do n’t know about , because this looks exactly like you . ”
67710	67719	67700	67700	I	94	“ Does my hair really look like that ? ”
67723	67728	67720	67720	Shasta	125	“ It is you ! ”
67729	67732	67733	67733	I	94	“ Shh ! ”
67771	67780	67754	67754	I	94	“ Oh God . What should I do ? ”
67781	67784	67786	67786	Shasta	125	“ Girl ! ”
67792	67812	67786	67786	Shasta	125	“ What you should do is tell me what the hell is going on with you and Cameron McGregor ! ”
67838	67907	67908	67908	She	125	“ How did you meet him ? How could you keep it a secret ? Are you two a thing ? Is he amazing in bed ? Oh , cripes , I bet he ’s crazy in bed . Is he hung ? You have to spill — oh ! How long can he last ? Is he freaky ? I bet he ’s super freaky , right ? ”
67932	67942	67908	67908	She	125	“ Ladies . Hard at work , are we ? ”
67981	67990	68027	68027	He	94	“ Um . Good morning , Mr. Maddox . ”
68022	68026	68027	68027	He	94	“ Good morning . ”
68073	68076	68068	68068	Shasta	125	“ Hi , ”
68087	68098	68099	68099	He	94	“ Joellen . I had a question about your application . ”
68109	68114	68099	68099	He	94	“ Walk with me . ”
68232	68240	68241	68241	His	94	“ So you ’re in the news . ”
68281	68295	68241	68241	His	94	“ Um . . . yeah . How ’d you hear about it ? ”
68296	68311	68342	68342	He	94	“ Word gets around fast . Was he the date you said you had ? ”
68312	68315	68316	68316	I	94	“ No ! ”
68322	68328	68316	68316	I	94	“ He ’s my neighbor ! ”
68353	68358	68342	68342	He	94	“ So you said . ”
68383	68408	68377	68377	he	94	“ He ’s just helping me with a . . . um . . . project . There ’s nothing going on between us . ”
68440	68447	68409	68409	We	1081	“ So you two made up ? ”
68448	68451	68452	68452	I	94	“ Huh ? ”
68460	68474	68452	68452	I	94	“ His music . You said he was disturbing you with his music . ”
68475	68488	68548	68548	Joellen	126	“ Oh . Right . That . Yes , we made up . ”
68508	68541	68503	68503	I	94	“ We called a truce , I mean . And then , uh , he needed help shopping for his , uh , girlfriend . In Scotland . For a Christmas present . ”
68634	68643	68645	68645	I	94	“ Meet me after work for a drink . ”
68653	68663	68645	68645	I	94	“ Six o’clock . The Liquid Kitty on Fifth . ”
68810	68814	68815	68815	she	1091	“ Be careful , ”
68823	68830	68815	68815	she	1091	“ Be very careful , Joellen . ”
68943	68954	68955	68955	I	94	“ I ’ve only got thirty minutes to get ready , ”
68968	68980	68955	68955	I	94	“ What should I wear ? Should I shave my legs ? ”
68991	69032	68981	68982	Mr. Bingley	370	“ You ’re right , that ’s just inviting trouble . But wait — I want trouble , do n’t I ? This is Michael Maddox we ’re talking about here . I want all the trouble I can get ! ”
69041	69097	69033	69034	The cat	482	“ No , you ’re right , play it cool , do n’t be overeager , focus on the long run . If I shag him in the bathroom of a bar called the Liquid Kitty the first time we go out , we ’ll never be able to tell anyone our first date story . ”
69295	69299	69300	69300	I	94	“ Screw it , ”
69303	69323	69300	69300	I	94	“ This is how I look . If Michael does n’t like it , he can suck an egg . ”
69560	69564	69572	69572	I	94	“ Good evening , ”
69580	69585	69572	69572	I	94	“ Oh . Hello . ”
69616	69625	69607	69607	His	1105	“ Are you here to meet a member ? ”
69657	69665	69655	69655	me	94	“ Um . . . Michael Maddox ? ”
69671	69683	69684	69684	He	1105	“ Very good . Please allow me to take your coat . ”
69698	69702	69703	69703	I	94	“ Thank you . ”
69752	69758	69737	69737	He	244	“ This way , miss . ”
69775	69777	69767	69767	I	94	“ miss ”
69780	69783	69772	69772	he	244	“ ma’am . ”
70140	70143	70145	70146	Tuxedo Man	244	“ Miss , ”

70231	70234	70235	70235	I	94	“ Hi , ”
70254	70260	70239	70239	He	370	“ Hi yourself . Sit . ”
70279	70285	70286	70286	He	370	“ Do you like bourbon ? ”
70300	70307	70298	70298	Gross	245	“ Yes ! I love it ! ”
70352	70361	70349	70349	Michael	370	“ How about a glass of wine instead ? ”
70398	70401	70389	70389	I	94	“ Thanks . ”
70414	70417	70402	70402	Michael	370	“ Sir ? ”
70418	70428	70402	70402	Michael	370	“ A bottle of the 2000 Romanée - Conti . ”
70445	70451	70402	70402	Michael	370	“ Right away , sir . ”
70487	70491	70471	70471	Michael	370	“ You came . ”
70505	70515	70492	70492	I	94	“ Um . Yes . I c - came . ”
70536	70544	70527	70527	he	1123	“ Your cheeks are burning , Joellen . ”
70552	70570	70550	70550	sir	370	“ I ’m a little . . . this is all a bit . . . surprising . ”
70702	70710	70690	70690	Michael	370	“ Michael ? Are you all right ? ”
70726	70752	70711	70711	He	370	“ I ’m sorry . You ’ll have to forgive me — it ’s been a rough couple of weeks . This divorce . . . ”
70762	70776	70753	70753	He	370	“ Enough about me and my problems . Let ’s talk about you . ”
70810	70836	70805	70805	I	94	“ It ’s totally normal to be upset when you ’re going through a divorce . You do n’t have to pretend everything ’s okay . ”
70863	70888	70845	70845	Michael	370	“ Thank you . That ’s very kind of you . I ’ve always liked that about you , Joellen . You ’re kind . ”
71006	71010	71001	71001	Michael	370	“ A toast . ”
71018	71024	71011	71011	I	94	“ What are we toasting ? ”
71036	71040	71025	71025	Michael	370	“ New beginnings . ”
71051	71055	71048	71048	I	94	“ New beginnings , ”
71105	71110	71111	71111	He	370	“ You ’re nervous . ”
71133	71139	71125	71125	I	94	“ It ’s that obvious ? ”
71140	71150	71122	71122	he	370	“ Do n’t be embarrassed . I ’m flattered . ”
71164	71169	71151	71151	I	94	“ You ’re flattered ? ”
71170	71173	71174	71174	he	370	“ That , ”
71187	71193	71174	71174	he	370	“ I really like that . ”
71199	71202	71195	71195	I	94	“ What ? ”
71227	71242	71203	71203	He	370	“ You ’re oblivious to how charming you are . It ’s very appealing . ”
71263	71267	71255	71255	I	94	“ Thank you . ”
71295	71302	71292	71292	he	370	“ Do you find me attractive ? ”
71318	71338	71303	71303	I	94	“ Attractive ? Are you kidding ? I think you ’re the most beautiful man I ’ve ever seen ! ”
71512	71516	71518	71518	Michael	370	“ Thank you , ”
71530	71539	71518	71518	Michael	370	“ I find you very attractive , too . ”
71624	71637	71605	71605	He	370	“ Um . . . you ’re technically still married , right ? ”
71647	71654	71638	71638	He	370	“ We ’ve filed for divorce . ”
71683	71715	71680	71680	I	94	“ I mean . . . it only just happened . Like , last week . Maybe you should . . . give yourself a minute to . . . adjust . ”
71743	71749	71750	71750	he	370	“ You ’re probably right , ”
71818	71826	71827	71827	He	2196	“ No , you ’re absolutely right . ”
71842	71890	71827	71827	He	2196	“ Good God , I ’m so sorry . I do n’t know what I ’m thinking . I keep putting you in these terrible positions . Next you ’ll probably think I ’m some kind of lecherous creep , expecting favors for advancement in the company ! ”
71930	71936	71937	71937	I	94	“ Do n’t be ridiculous ! ”
71981	72005	71977	71977	Michael	370	“ Yes . We ’ll each have filets , rare , and we ’ll share the Caesar . And another bottle of wine . ”
72006	72012	71977	71977	Michael	370	“ Very good , sir . ”
72140	72152	72131	72131	I	94	“ I ’m gon na go . Thanks for the wine . ”
72153	72165	72131	72131	I	94	“ What ? You ’re going ? You just got here ! ”
72179	72182	72183	72183	I	94	“ Sorry , ”
72186	72196	72183	72183	I	94	“ I ’m sorry . See you at work . ”
72197	72216	72183	72183	I	94	“ Joellen , wait ! Do n’t go ! Please , just sit down and talk to me ! ”
72272	72308	72309	72309	He	370	“ Thank you so much for inviting me here , and thank you again for the wine , but I ca n’t stay for dinner . I . . . I already have dinner plans . ”
72358	72371	72355	72355	he	370	“ I want to talk more . Can I call you later ? ”
72403	72414	72428	72428	He	370	“ That ’s not necessary . I already have it . ”
72423	72427	72415	72415	I	94	“ You do ? ”
72446	72459	72428	72428	He	370	“ Well , technically I have all my employees ’ phone numbers . ”
72460	72465	72466	72466	I	94	“ Oh . Right . ”
72473	72479	72466	72466	I	94	“ Of course you do . ”
72521	72536	72537	72537	He	370	“ Okay . I get it . We ’re giving me time to adjust . ”
72576	72586	72573	72573	He	370	“ I hope it wo n’t take too long . ”
72656	72661	72662	72662	I	94	“ It ’s open , ”
72724	72735	72719	72719	His	366	“ Were you on the phone with your mum again ? ”
72736	72752	72753	72753	Cam	366	“ I went for drinks with Michael . He tried to kiss me . Twice . ”
72764	72767	72753	72753	Cam	366	“ Tried ? ”
72869	72877	72861	72861	His	366	“ You wanna tell me what happened ? ”
72914	72920	72921	72921	He	366	“ What do you think ? ”
72941	72948	72921	72921	He	366	“ I think it was smart . ”
72957	72963	72949	72949	I	94	“ Smart ? Which part ? ”
72964	72983	73014	73014	He	366	“ The whole thing . It was well played . Delay will only make him want you more . ”
72984	72993	72949	72949	I	94	“ Cam , I was n’t playing him ! ”
73003	73013	72994	72994	He	366	“ So you did n’t want to kiss him ? ”
73023	73039	73014	73014	He	366	“ In case you have n’t noticed , this is n’t a game to me ! ”
73040	73047	73014	73014	He	366	“ Do n’t dodge the question . ”
73072	73090	73069	73069	I	94	“ It just did n’t feel right . The whole thing was weird . Like , sudden . ”
73097	73117	73091	73091	Cam	366	“ You ’ve been lustin ’ after the man for a decade , lass . That ’s hardly sudden . ”
73118	73152	73091	73091	Cam	366	“ Sudden from his side ! He never noticed me before a few weeks ago , and now we ’re drinking wine at his private club the second his wife files for divorce ? ”
73153	73169	73091	73091	Cam	366	“ How d’you know he never noticed you before ? Did he tell you that ? ”
73176	73183	73170	73170	I	94	“ Well . . . no . ”
73184	73200	73091	73091	Cam	366	“ He ’s been married the entire time you ’ve known each other , right ? ”
73201	73204	73170	73170	I	94	“ Yes . ”
73205	73226	73091	73091	Cam	366	“ So he was n’t in a position to tell you if he fancied you . This was his chance . ”
73267	73297	73252	73252	I	94	“ Honestly I do n’t know what to think . I acted like I was having a breakdown . I was a complete wreck . I probably blew it . ”
73298	73308	73252	73252	I	94	“ Except he said he wanted to call you . ”
73318	73327	73252	73252	I	94	“ What kind of wine did he order ? ”
73337	73343	73328	73328	I	94	“ Why does that matter ? ”
73344	73354	73369	73369	Cam	366	“ It matters . Do you remember the name ? ”
73360	73368	73355	73355	I	94	“ Romany Conty ? Something like that ? ”
73373	73382	73369	73369	Cam	366	“ Jesus . He must really like you . ”
73383	73396	73369	73369	Cam	366	“ You recognize it ? I thought you did n’t drink wine . ”
73397	73428	73369	73369	Cam	366	“ Does n’t mean I do n’t know the name of one of the most expensive burgundies on earth . They ’re at least a few thousand dollars a bottle . ”
73441	73461	73369	73369	Cam	366	“ Let ’s get back to you not wantin ’ to kiss him . What ’s that all about ? ”
73477	73489	73462	73462	I	94	“ I guess . . . I was just too nervous . ”
73497	73500	73494	73494	Cam	366	“ Hmm . ”
73514	73517	73509	73509	he	366	“ Hmm , ”
73528	73538	73586	73586	Cam	366	“ Ohmigod . Do you think that ’s him ? ”
73539	73553	73586	73586	Cam	366	“ Only one way to find out , lass . Go answer it . ”
73559	73585	73554	73554	I	94	“ What if I say something really stupid ? What if I ruin the whole thing ? This might be my last chance with him ! ”
73615	73632	73586	73586	Cam	366	“ You go pick up the portable extension in my bedroom and walk me through it ! ”
73638	73661	73633	73633	He	366	“ Do n’t be daft . I ’m not lurkin ’ in the background while you and pretty boy have phone sex ! ”
73662	73672	73633	73633	He	366	“ We ’re not going to have phone sex ! ”
73706	73717	73718	73718	I	94	“ Pick it up ! Go , go , go ! ”
73739	73742	73718	73718	I	94	“ Hello ? ”
73743	73750	73782	73782	He	366	“ Joellen , it ’s Michael . ”
73751	73757	73758	73758	I	94	“ Oh . Hi there . ”
73837	73856	73834	73834	Michael	370	“ I ’m in the car . I could n’t wait until I got home to call you . ”
73868	73894	73857	73857	I	94	“ I hope you have Bluetooth . It ’s dangerous and illegal to drive while talking on the phone if you ’re not hands free . ”
73937	73947	73934	73934	Michael	370	“ I ’m not driving . My driver is . ”
73948	73951	73952	73952	Duh	249	“ Oh . ”
73954	73962	73934	73934	Michael	370	“ But thank you for your concern . ”
73973	73986	73934	73934	Michael	370	“ It ’s gratifying to know you ’re worried about my safety . ”
74009	74033	73987	73987	Cam	366	“ So , um . . . sorry again about running out on you like that . I think I was just nervous . ”
74056	74110	74111	74111	Cam	366	“ No apologies necessary . Though I have to admit when you said you already had plans for dinner , I was a little worried . You said there is n’t anything going on with you and that idiot Cameron McGregor character , but I hope I do n’t have any other competition ! ”
74166	74181	74152	74152	I	94	“ He ’s not an idiot . He ’s actually a really great guy . ”
74190	74212	74182	74182	Michael	370	“ You only think that because you ’re nice , Joellen . Believe me , the man is an absolute animal . ”
74243	74255	74182	74182	Michael	370	“ How would you know ? You ’ve never met him ! ”
74275	74295	74270	74270	Michael	370	“ No , I have n’t . But if even half of what is printed about him is true — ”
74296	74307	74308	74308	Cam	366	“ Do n’t believe everything you read in the papers . ”
74354	74362	74347	74347	he	370	“ You seem rather defensive of him . ”
74400	74414	74415	74415	Cam	366	“ I suppose I am . He ’s my . . . friend . ”
74444	74464	74433	74433	Michael	370	“ Really ? You ’d befriend a man who got a teenage girl pregnant and denies any responsibility whatsoever ? ”
74485	74487	74481	74481	Cam	366	“ End ”
74537	74543	74518	74518	He	366	“ Do you believe him ? ”
74544	74557	74518	74518	He	366	“ First of all , why the hell did you hang up ? ”
74558	74570	74518	74518	He	366	“ He ’ll call back in ten seconds . Do you ? ”
74646	74659	74635	74635	I	94	“ It ’s not really any of my business , is it ? ”
74684	74701	74678	74678	he	366	“ Then why ’re you judgin ’ me for it without even knowin ’ the truth ? ”
74711	74718	74678	74678	he	366	“ I ’m not judging you . ”
74719	74722	74678	74678	he	366	“ Bullshit . ”
74735	74741	74678	74678	he	366	“ So is it true ? ”
74769	74776	74751	74751	he	366	“ So what is the truth ? ”
74784	74792	74751	74751	he	366	“ Are you gon na get that ? ”
74793	74809	74810	74810	Cam	366	“ I ’m talking to you right now . I ’ll talk to him later . ”
74918	74926	74914	74914	he	366	“ Does it really matter , Joellen ? ”
74945	74953	74937	74937	I	94	“ Yes , of course it matters . ”
74959	74962	74954	74954	His	366	“ Why ? ”
74963	74968	74969	74969	I	94	“ Because . . . ”
74982	74988	74969	74969	I	94	“ Because we ’re friends . ”
74996	75008	74989	74989	His	366	“ Your ability to lie to yourself is remarkable , lass . ”
75034	75042	75026	75026	he	366	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
75062	75071	75056	75056	He	366	“ It means we ’ll never be friends . ”
75346	75351	75352	75352	He	366	“ Oh . Hey . ”
75401	75425	75426	75426	He	366	“ I get it . What you meant when you said we ’d never be friends . And I ’m cool with it . ”
75459	75547	75426	75426	He	366	“ I mean , I ’d rather be friends than not , but if you prefer we keep it businesslike , that ’s fine with me . You ’re going to be living here for a while longer , and it would be easier if we can be civil to each other . I really do n’t want to have to deal with your rap music again . Also I ’d still like your help with the Michael thing , if you ’re still up for it . ”
75556	75566	75548	75548	His	366	“ You ’re sure that ’s what you want ? ”
75574	75578	75569	75569	he	366	“ Which part ? ”
75579	75588	75608	75608	He	366	“ Michael . He ’s what you want ? ”
75604	75607	75569	75569	he	366	“ Yes . ”
75620	75634	75608	75608	He	366	“ All right , lass , drink up . Let ’s get goin’ . ”
75704	75718	75692	75692	he	366	“ If you talk to pretty boy today , do n’t reassure him . ”
75719	75723	75692	75692	he	366	“ About what ? ”
75724	75763	75692	75692	he	366	“ About anything . Me , the ‘ other competition ’ he mentioned , how your not - date went . Just play it off like none of it matters . It ’ll drive him crazy . Okay ? ”
75764	75770	75692	75692	he	366	“ Okay . And thanks . ”
75778	75783	75771	75771	He	366	“ You ’re welcome . ”
76025	76030	76038	76038	Cam	366	“ Joellen Bixby speaking . ”
76031	76037	76038	76038	Cam	366	“ This mornin ’ sucked . ”
76052	76063	76047	76047	I	94	“ Last night , too . I could n’t sleep . ”
76074	76078	76071	76071	he	366	“ Me neither . ”
76079	76087	76038	76038	Cam	366	“ Are you still mad at me ? ”
76088	76098	76099	76099	he	366	“ I was never mad at you , lass , ”
76103	76109	76099	76099	he	366	“ You bloody hardheaded woman . ”
76122	76144	76118	76118	I	94	“ Good , because if I had to listen to your music again , I ’d throw myself out a window . ”
76148	76158	76145	76145	He	366	“ That ’s a little dramatic , don’tcha think ? ”
76159	76171	76184	76184	His	366	“ Plus I owe you two more home - cooked meals . ”
76172	76183	76145	76145	He	366	“ Is that right ? You ’ve been countin ’ ? ”
76204	76209	76210	76210	I	94	“ So have you , ”
76215	76238	76210	76210	I	94	“ and do n’t even try to deny it , prancer . My meat loaf is the best part of your day . ”
76239	76254	76184	76184	His	366	“ Aye , lass . Your loaf is almost as good as your pie . ”
76266	76280	76255	76255	I	94	“ Speaking of my pie , any requests for your last two meals ? ”
76291	76317	76281	76281	Cam	366	“ Well of course I want that pie , lassie . I love that pie . Sweetest thing I ’ve ever had in my mouth . ”
76365	76381	76382	76382	He	366	“ There ’s a picture of us on the internet . A celebrity gossip site . ”
76388	76397	76382	76382	He	366	“ I ’m sorry . Are you okay ? ”
76398	76470	76382	76382	He	366	“ Yes , I ’m fine , and you do n’t have to be sorry . I think it ’s raised my cred around the office . The girl who sits next to me is treating me like I ’m Beyoncé . And a couple of the guys in accounting said hi to me on the elevator . I think next they ’re going to ask me to get your autograph . ”
76474	76492	76471	76471	Cam	366	“ It ’s not me the guys from accounting are interested in , you wee daft bugger . ”
76525	76538	76509	76509	I	94	“ You ’re very good for my ego , you know that ? ”
76542	76560	76539	76539	He	366	“ Well , you ’re shit for mine , so at least one of us is happy . ”
76580	76591	76593	76593	he	366	“ Do n’t forget I called you beautiful , prancer . ”
76610	76650	76603	76603	he	366	“ I meant it , too . You ’re like this big , gorgeous , mountain of a man , who also happens to have a great sense of humor and an excellent vocabulary . You ’re a catch . ”
76674	76697	76671	76671	he	366	“ Sounds like I deserve a sonnet . We ’ll call it ‘ Mountain Man . ’ What rhymes with enormous muscles ? ”
76713	76734	76702	76702	I	94	“ I already wrote you one . But it was n’t about your muscles , it was about your eyes . ”
76785	76790	76774	76774	Cam	366	“ Sure , lass . ”
76847	76855	76857	76857	Cam	366	“ Why ’re you breathin ’ funny ? ”
76865	76895	76857	76857	Cam	366	“ That pesky intestinal gas botherin ’ you again ? You want me to stop by the store and pick you up a few pairs of your charcoal panties ? ”
76896	76899	76900	76900	I	94	“ Ha . ”
76910	76913	76914	76914	He	366	“ Wait . ”
76921	76934	76914	76914	He	366	“ Do n’t tell me you really did write me a sonnet . ”
76951	76964	76965	76965	God	1890	“ Lassie . You know what happens if you lie to me . ”
76984	77002	76978	76978	I	94	“ Yes , I know what happens , prancer . You ’ll take me over your knee . ”
77003	77008	76965	76965	God	1890	“ That ’s right . ”
77009	77027	76978	76978	I	94	“ But . . . if I just do n’t admit something , that ’s not lying . ”
77028	77041	76965	76965	God	1890	“ It ’s a lie of omission . It is lyin ’ . ”
77042	77058	76978	76978	I	94	“ God , it ’s like you ’re looking for an excuse to spank me ! ”
77059	77083	76965	76965	God	1890	“ I ’d like an excuse to do a lot of bad things to you , darlin ’ . You have no idea . ”
77137	77141	77142	77142	I	94	“ Like what ? ”
77172	77194	77142	77142	I	94	“ Ach , would n’t you like to know ! Do n’t you have work to be doin’ , you slacker ? ”
77195	77206	77142	77142	I	94	“ Hey , you ’re the one who called me . ”
77207	77232	77233	77233	His	1890	“ Aye , I did . And now I ’m gon na hang up . Do n’t forget — pie tonight , darlin ’ . ”
77237	77245	77233	77233	His	1890	“ And I want it extra hot . ”
77300	77317	77318	77318	he	1890	“ Fair warnin ’ to all the occupants of this house , Cameron McGregor is here ! ”
77369	77379	77382	77382	Cam	366	“ Hullo , you wee ball - less bastard , ”
77390	77396	77382	77382	Cam	366	“ Where ’s your mum ? ”
77397	77401	77407	77407	Cam	366	“ In here ! ”
77429	77432	77433	77433	he	366	“ Lassie , ”
77441	77451	77433	77433	he	366	“ what d’you think of my new fur coat ? ”
77464	77480	77452	77452	I	94	“ I think that animal is almost as in love with you as you are . ”
77481	77494	77495	77495	He	366	“ Aye . He ’s a sensible lad . How was work ? ”
77527	77596	77516	77516	I	94	“ Good . And weird . Michael left me an apology note on my desk with his cell phone number . Portia keeps glaring at me like she ’s plotting my kidnapping and murder . And the girl who sits next to me wo n’t stop pestering me about the size of your junk . She ’s convinced that picture on TMZ is proof that we ’re boning . ”
77597	77621	77622	77622	He	94	“ We already had the talk about you disrespectin ’ the family jewels by callin ’ ’em ‘ junk , ’ darlin ’ . ”
77647	77650	77651	77651	I	94	“ Hey ! ”
77656	77669	77651	77651	I	94	“ You know I do n’t like it when you do that ! ”
77670	77686	77687	77687	He	94	“ It ’s my dinner , lass . I ’ll eat it how I want . ”
77731	77746	77721	77721	I	94	“ You should n’t eat undercooked meat , prancer . You ’ll get salmonella . ”
77747	77770	77705	77706	Mr. Bingley	370	“ Pfft . As if bacteria would dare to mess with me . I ’ll have you know I never get sick . ”
77771	77792	77721	77721	I	94	“ Make yourself useful and set the table before I dump this pan over the top of your thick skull . ”
77793	77801	77705	77706	Mr. Bingley	370	“ So you told her , right ? ”
77843	77848	77807	77807	He	94	“ Told who what ? ”
77849	77870	77826	77826	Cam	366	“ Told the girl who sits next to you at work about the majesty and opulence of my family jewels . ”
77886	77889	77877	77877	I	94	“ No . ”
77890	77904	77924	77924	Cam	366	“ Why not ? It ’s not as if you do n’t know . ”
77912	77923	77924	77924	Cam	366	“ Are you going to set the table or not ? ”
77934	77940	77924	77924	Cam	366	“ Tell her eleven inches . ”
77954	77968	77948	77948	he	366	“ Or you could tell her the truth and see if she faints . ”
77990	77994	77995	77995	I	94	“ Moving on , ”
78012	78022	78008	78008	Joellen	126	“ What do you think about Michael ’s note ? ”
78040	78046	78035	78035	he	366	“ Did you call him ? ”
78047	78050	78023	78023	I	94	“ No . ”
78051	78057	78035	78035	he	366	“ Did you email him ? ”
78058	78061	78023	78023	I	94	“ No . ”
78062	78071	78035	78035	he	366	“ Did you see him around the office ? ”
78072	78075	78023	78023	I	94	“ No . ”
78076	78090	78035	78035	he	366	“ Then I think you ’re gon na get a phone call tonight . ”
78097	78100	78091	78091	My	94	“ Really ? ”
78101	78109	78023	78023	I	94	“ Yep . We should talk strategy . ”
78110	78120	78091	78091	My	94	“ Strategy ? You make it sound like war . ”
78136	78154	78121	78121	Cam	366	“ Love is war , darlin ’ . Only thing in life worth sheddin ’ blood over . ”
78257	78263	78254	78254	he	366	“ That ’s dark beer . ”
78264	78278	78299	78299	Cam	366	“ I know . I remembered that ’s what you said you liked . ”
78293	78298	78287	78287	I	94	“ It ’s imported . ”
78303	78322	78299	78299	Cam	366	“ The guy at the store told me it was good . It cost more than the meat ! ”
78323	78331	78332	78332	he	366	“ No need to shout , lassie , ”
78343	78351	78332	78332	he	366	“ I hear you loud and clear . ”
78389	78394	78395	78395	I	94	“ You ’re impossible , ”
78398	78409	78395	78395	I	94	“ Impossibly wonderful , I know . Back to strategy . ”
78463	78478	78536	78536	Cam	366	“ Fine . Strategy . Tell me how I should act when he calls . ”
78479	78488	78536	78536	Cam	366	“ The same way you act with me . ”
78494	78507	78489	78489	I	94	“ I ca n’t act with him like I act with you ! ”
78508	78515	78536	78536	Cam	366	“ Like yourself , you mean ? ”
78516	78535	78489	78489	I	94	“ Exactly ! He ’ll never like me if I act like myself ! I ’m a disaster ! ”
78563	78627	78536	78536	Cam	366	“ Bypassin ’ how barmy it is that you ’d wanna be with a man who wo n’t like you if you act like yourself , what I meant was do n’t cater to his ego . Do n’t fall all over yourself to pay him compliments . Treat him like he ’s your little brother : sometimes cute but mostly annoyin ’ . ”
78638	78656	78628	78628	I	94	“ How is treating a man like he ’s annoying in any way attractive to said man ? ”
78657	78769	78805	78805	Cam	366	“ It does n’t work with all men . But on lads like him — rich and pretty , used to havin’ women fall at his feet — it works like a charm . Because you ’re a challenge , you see ? You ’re different . He has to chase you , which is fun but also establishes that you have value . You wo n’t just hand yourself over . When a man has to work hard for somethin’ he wants , he values it twice as much when he finally gets it . Then you ’re a prize that he earned , not a gift he was given . ”
78797	78804	78791	78791	Cam	366	“ Okay , that makes sense . ”
78820	78839	78805	78805	Cam	366	“ I ’m sorry , could you repeat that ? Did you just admit I might be right ? ”
78840	78847	78805	78805	Cam	366	“ Shut up . What else ? ”
78965	78968	78969	78969	I	94	“ What ? ”
78979	79017	78969	78969	I	94	“ Nothin’ . Only you might want to work on developin ’ a bit more of a poker face , lassie . If you leer at Michael like that , he ’ll know the jig is up . ”
79018	79026	78969	78969	I	94	“ I was n’t leering at you ! ”
79027	79084	78969	78969	I	94	“ I can take my shirt off if you like . I ’ll even let you pet my biceps , but that ’s as far as it ’s goin’ because I ’m not just a beautiful , sonnet - worthy Mountain Man , you know . I ’m a human being . I ’ve got feelings . ”
79119	79124	79125	79125	I	94	“ You ’re funny , ”
79135	79145	79125	79125	I	94	“ Can we get back to strategy , please ? ”
79158	79171	79146	79146	I	94	“ You ’re adorable when you ’re embarrassed . Those pink cheeks . ”
79222	79274	79210	79210	Cam	366	“ All right , movin ’ on . Rule number one — we’ll call it the golden rule — is make him chase you . The longer , the better . But there are lots of subrules to this one . They all involve the art of parsin ’ yourself out . ”
79275	79281	79210	79210	Cam	366	“ That sounds disturbingly prostitutional . ”
79282	79325	79210	79210	Cam	366	“ Think of it like you ’re leavin ’ a trail of crumbs . Small , delicious Joellen crumbs . A little bit here , a little bit there , just enough to heighten his hunger but never enough to satisfy it . ”
79340	79347	79326	79326	I	94	“ This is all very complicated . ”
79348	79375	79380	79380	he	366	“ It ’s the easiest thing in the world , darlin ’ . It ’s called seduction , and it ’s a game where everyone wins . ”
79383	79391	79380	79380	he	366	“ What was that wistful sigh for ? ”
79392	79410	79411	79411	Cam	366	“ Everything would be so much easier if it could just be like it is with us . ”
79427	79437	79418	79418	He	366	“ You mean if you could just be friends . ”
79494	79497	79498	79498	Dazzled	254	“ Oh ! ”
79510	79513	79534	79534	Cam	366	“ What ? ”
79525	79533	79514	79514	I	94	“ I ’ll pretend he ’s you ! ”
79561	79565	79543	79543	He	366	“ Come again ? ”
79566	79582	79543	79543	He	366	“ Like you told me to do when we kissed — pretend you were him ! ”
79583	79588	79589	79589	he	366	“ And did you ? ”
79662	79667	79647	79647	I	94	“ Um . . . ”
79668	79672	79674	79674	Cam	366	“ Go ahead , ”
79677	79682	79674	79674	Cam	366	“ Lie to me . ”
79805	79808	79799	79799	I	94	“ Hello ? ”
79809	79816	79842	79842	Cam	366	“ Joellen . It ’s Michael . ”
79834	79841	79799	79799	I	94	“ Oh . Hello , Michael . ”
79860	79871	79881	79881	Cam	366	“ Is now a good time for us to talk ? ”
79872	79875	79881	79881	Cam	366	“ Actually , Michael”—I
79876	79880	79881	79881	Cam	366	swallow—“I have company . ”
79899	79902	79903	79903	Michael	370	“ Company ? ”
79944	79947	79948	79948	I	94	“ Yes , ”
79956	79967	79948	79948	I	94	“ Company . I ’ll have to call you back . ”
79985	80003	79968	79968	Michael	370	“ Of course . I ’m free for the rest of the night . Call me anytime . ”
80004	80010	79968	79968	Michael	370	“ Will do . Thanks . ”
80011	80016	79968	79968	Michael	370	“ Good - bye . ”
80017	80020	79968	79968	Michael	370	“ Bye . ”
80075	80080	80081	80081	he	366	“ That was good , ”
80087	80116	80081	80081	he	366	“ Sounded very natural . When you call him back , do n’t talk for more than ten minutes , and make sure you end the call first . ”
80117	80127	80128	80128	Cam	366	“ I ’m not going to call him back . ”
80140	80143	80128	80128	Cam	366	“ No ? ”
80144	80158	80081	80081	he	366	“ I have a dinner guest . I ’ll talk to him tomorrow . ”
80174	80188	80164	80164	Cam	366	“ You ’ve been waitin ’ on him for ten years , lassie . ”
80189	80215	80128	80128	Cam	366	“ So one more day wo n’t hurt . Besides , I need practice with the golden rule . I ’m dropping crumbs , right ? ”
80216	80229	80164	80164	Cam	366	“ I dunno , Joellen . Is that what you ’re doin’ ? ”
80342	80373	80338	80338	he	366	“ Whatever it is you ’re doin’ , you better be sure . Take your time . Figure it out . But be sure . You owe it to yourself . ”
80407	80421	80385	80385	He	366	“ Now gimme that goddamn pie , woman . I ’m starvin ’ . ”
80556	80559	80548	80548	I	94	“ Hunger , ”
81085	81090	81091	81091	I	94	“ Oh my God , ”
81511	81514	81521	81521	Cam	366	“ Joellen . ”
81559	81570	81572	81573	the receptionist	1226	“ This gentleman said you were expecting him , Joellen ? ”
81600	81611	81612	81612	Cam	366	“ Do n’t tell me you forgot our lunch date , ”
81624	81628	81629	81629	I	94	“ Lunch date ? ”
81647	81667	81643	81643	I	94	“ Oh ! Yes ! Sorry , I was just so absorbed in work I lost track of time ! ”
81720	81726	81711	81711	I	94	“ Okay ! All set ! ”
81817	81824	81811	81811	I	94	“ What are you doing here ? ”
81825	81836	81837	81837	His	366	“ I could ask you the same thing , lass . ”
81968	81991	81992	81992	Cam	366	“ Well , this is certainly a surprise . I recognize you from the tabloids . Cameron McGregor , am I correct ? ”
82054	82090	82036	82036	Cam	366	“ Aye . You ’ll be wantin ’ an autograph , I ’m sure , but you ’ll have to excuse me , mate . I ’m just ’ leavin ’ for lunch with Joellen . ”
82115	82124	82091	82091	Michael	370	“ I was n’t asking for an autograph . ”
82274	82280	82281	82281	she	340	“ Oh . Pardon me , ”
82284	82289	82281	82281	she	340	“ Am I interrupting ? ”
82311	82319	82307	82307	I	94	“ We were just leaving for lunch ! ”
82365	82385	82361	82361	Michael	370	“ It ’s a bit early for lunch , is n’t it ? It ’s barely past eleven o’clock . ”
82393	82407	82386	82386	Cam	366	“ Joellen could n’t wait . Called and asked me to come sooner . ”
82464	82510	82511	82511	She	340	“ How nice ! You work so hard , Joellen . You deserve to take a long lunch . I ’ll speak to you later this afternoon . I just wanted to go over your current workload with you . It can wait . Gentlemen . ”
82554	82570	82571	82571	Cam	366	“ C’m on , lass . I know how you get when you ’re hungry . ”
82656	82667	82670	82670	Cam	366	“ Have a great lunch . See you later . Mr. McGregor”—he
82675	82684	82670	82670	Cam	366	smile—“it was a real treat to meet you . ”
82710	82717	82703	82703	His	366	“ I get that a lot . ”
82764	82770	82771	82771	I	94	“ Holy hell , McGregor , ”
82779	82789	82771	82771	I	94	“ I hope you know what you ’re doing . ”
82797	82808	82790	82790	Cam	366	“ Sure I do . I ’m wagin ’ war . ”
82818	82859	82815	82815	he	370	“ If that prissy little peacock was n’t in love with you before , he definitely is now . There ’s nothin’ his kind hates more than a lower - class grunt gettin ’ uppity and poachin ’ his property . ”
82860	82877	82815	82815	he	370	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , McGregor . Michael does n’t think I ’m his property . ”
82878	82915	82815	82815	he	370	“ Aye , lass , he does . The question is whether or not you ’re gon na enjoy it when you find out what bein ’ the property of a man like him is like . ”
82953	82960	82945	82945	I	94	“ Bitch , what the hell ? ”
83050	83056	83057	83057	I	94	“ I love Italian food , ”
83072	83076	83077	83077	He	366	“ I know . ”
83098	83108	83095	83095	he	366	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle told me it ’s your favorite . ”
83112	83145	83109	83109	I	94	“ Yeah , I ’m always trying to get her to try my lasagna , but whenever I suggest it , she looks at me as if I ’ve farted in church . ”
83146	83158	83095	83095	he	366	“ The British are n’t exactly known for being adventurous eaters . ”
83159	83170	83109	83109	I	94	“ I ’d hardly call noodles and tomato sauce adventurous . ”
83174	83180	83171	83171	Cam	366	“ You ’re not British . ”
83181	83188	83095	83095	he	366	“ You ’ve got me there . ”
83189	83221	83171	83171	Cam	366	“ But pretty boy certainly is . He ’d give the Prince of Wales a run for his money in the silk - pocket - square - and - stuffiness department . ”
83230	83236	83222	83222	I	94	“ He ’s just reserved . ”
83237	83243	83095	83095	he	366	“ Repressed , you mean . ”
83290	83304	83281	83281	I	94	“ Carbs are proof that God loves us , do n’t you think ? ”
83305	83315	83316	83316	He	366	“ I think Benjamin Franklin said that about wine . ”
83329	83334	83316	83316	He	366	“ You ’re staring . ”
83335	83363	83316	83316	He	366	“ I like watchin ’ you eat . Your enjoyment of food is obvious . It ’s not often a woman allows herself that pleasure in public . ”
83400	83410	83391	83391	Cam	366	“ Do n’t be embarrassed . It ’s sexy . ”
83474	83477	83471	83471	Cam	366	“ So . ”
83478	83481	83471	83471	Cam	366	“ So . ”
83490	83506	83482	83482	His	366	“ D’you wanna talk about your little internet research project first , or pretty boy ? ”
83517	83542	83507	83507	I	94	“ Okay . Pretty boy it is . No , wait , first tell me who the woman was who stopped by your desk ? ”
83543	83548	83507	83507	I	94	“ That was Portia . ”
83554	83571	83549	83549	He	366	“ She did n’t seem nearly as bad as you ’ve made her out to be . ”
83572	83589	83590	83590	I	94	“ I know . It ’s weird . She almost seemed human for a minute there . ”
83602	83637	83590	83590	I	94	“ She was probably just dazed into acting like a person and not a witch because her brain was taking a nice warm dopamine bath brought on by standing three feet away from you . ”
83645	83661	83638	83638	Cam	366	“ Oh ? Is that what happens to females when I walk into a room ? ”
83669	83709	83662	83662	I	94	“ Oh , please , McGregor . You know the effect you have on women . It ’s like you ’re one of those magicians who does mass hypnosis tricks , making everyone in the audience crow like roosters . ”
83718	83722	83710	83710	He	366	“ Not everyone . ”
83755	83775	83723	83724	The waiter	1123	“ Pretty boy ’s gon na ask you what the deal is with us , first thing he can . ”
83776	83787	83723	83724	The waiter	1123	“ I ’ve already told him we ’re just friends . ”
83788	83839	83840	83840	His	366	“ You ’re gon na have to tell him again . But do n’t get drawn into a long discussion about it . Wave your hand like you just did at me , and change the subject . If he insists , tell him that I ’m not your type . ”
83844	83858	83840	83840	His	366	“ It wo n’t take much convincin ’ for him to believe it . ”
83859	83866	83867	83867	Cam	366	“ Why do you say that ? ”
83882	83901	83867	83867	Cam	366	“ Because no matter how much money I have , I ’m still just a jobby to him . ”
83902	83905	83867	83867	Cam	366	“ Jobby ? ”
83906	83928	83867	83867	Cam	366	“ Trash . Unworthy to even be in his presence , much less earn the attention of a woman he fancies . ”
84028	84035	84056	84056	he	366	“ Spit it out , lass . ”
84060	84072	84056	84056	he	366	“ I already told you , you can ask me anything . ”
84128	84165	84166	84166	Cam	366	“ I owe you an apology for assuming your life was all butterflies and rainbows . It makes me feel crappy that you probably get that a lot . Assumptions about who you are . Judgments . ”
84173	84184	84166	84166	Cam	366	“ Thank you . But that was n’t a question . ”
84309	84315	84306	84318	someone who says “ I ’m here for you ” and proves it	370	“ I ’m here for you ”
84340	84343	84336	84336	Cam	366	“ Lass . ”
84365	84371	84348	84348	I	94	“ Give me a minute , ”
84418	84496	84506	84506	Cam	366	“ I think you ’re an amazing person . I appreciate everything you ’ve done for me . This whole Michael project . . . it means a lot . I do n’t take your help for granted . And I ’m sorry for all the stupid things I ’ve said to you , all the times I ’ve been sarcastic or flippant . I was n’t trying to be mean . I was just . . . ”
84497	84505	84506	84506	Cam	366	“ You were just bein ’ yourself , ”
84532	84597	84527	84527	he	366	“ You can quit beatin ’ yourself up now , lass . I know you appreciate me . And I love that sharp tongue of yours . I love that you feel comfortable enough with me to give me a good dressin ’ down . I need that , y’know . Someone to stick a pin in my balloon when it gets too inflated . ”
84604	84618	84598	84598	I	94	“ Your balloon must have a lot more pinpricks since you met me . ”
84630	84646	84619	84619	He	94	“ Aye . But a real friend is someone who stabs you in the front . ”
84647	84653	84619	84619	He	94	“ That ’s Oscar Wilde . ”
84654	84683	84619	84619	He	94	“ Do n’t look so surprised , lass . I ’ve read Oscar Wilde . You did n’t think I was just another pretty face , did you ? ”
84693	84700	84684	84684	We	1261	“ So , we are friends . ”
84708	84722	84701	84701	He	94	“ Why is it so important to you this relationship has a title ? ”
84915	84933	84901	84901	he	366	“ Yes . I ’ll call it Mountain Man Unmasked . It ’ll be an instant bestseller . ”
84934	84953	84973	84973	he	366	“ Okay . I ’ll approve it . But only if you include the sonnet about my eyes . ”
85123	85153	85154	85154	She	1226	“ Oh my gosh , Joellen , I did n’t know who that was when he came in . I only knew he was big and handsome and oh ! ”
85159	85197	85154	85154	She	1226	“ So hot ! But then Shasta told me who he was and showed me the picture of you guys on TMZ and geez , are you dating him ? How long has this been going on ? ”
85198	85204	85205	85205	I	94	“ He ’s my neighbor , ”
85227	85246	85215	85215	Kim	261	“ So you ’re not dating him ? Oh gosh , that ’s a shame , that man is just”—she
85248	85279	85215	85215	Kim	261	herself—“scorching ! But he ’s your neighbor , you say ? Maybe I could come over and hang out sometime , you know , like tonight ? Are you free ? ”
85312	85315	85316	85316	she	125	“ Joellen ! ”
85323	85345	85316	85316	she	125	“ Holy fucksicles that man is ten times hotter in person than he is in pictures ! And he ’s huge ! ”
85346	85355	85298	85298	She	125	“ Do n’t ask me about his ju — ”
85356	85386	85387	85387	She	125	“ You have to tell me what he looks like naked ! Please ? Pretty please ? Just give me a hint how big it is ! Like this ? ”
85403	85406	85387	85387	She	125	“ This ? ”
85418	85437	85413	85413	I	94	“ You ’re deranged , Shasta . He ’s not a piece of meat . Let it go . ”
85580	85584	85585	85585	I	94	“ You guys ! ”
85591	85601	85585	85585	I	94	“ Chill out ! He ’s just my neighbor ! ”
85602	85609	85610	85610	Portia	340	“ What ’s going on here ? ”
85678	85700	85670	85670	she	340	“ Sorry about that . I , uh , think everyone was a little . . . overexcited by my visitor . ”
85712	85745	85670	85670	she	340	“ One can hardly blame them . The last time we had a male visitor on the thirty - third floor was when Theodore Scanlon came in to negotiate his new contract . ”
85810	85815	85887	85887	she	340	“ Write what you know ”
85824	85832	85887	85887	she	340	“ Did you have a nice lunch ? ”
85849	85854	85833	85833	I	94	“ Yes , thanks . ”
85855	85879	85898	85898	She	340	“ I ’m glad to hear it . I meant it when I said you deserved it , Joellen . You really do . ”
85909	85924	85898	85898	She	340	“ Portia , did n’t you want to talk to me about my workload ? ”
85941	85963	85937	85937	She	340	“ Oh , never mind . I found what I was looking for . Just . . . moving things around . ”
86199	86202	86182	86182	I	94	“ Hello ? ”
86203	86208	86219	86219	his	370	“ Hello , Joellen . ”
86222	86227	86219	86219	his	370	“ Hi , Michael ! ”
86228	86237	86182	86182	I	94	“ Is this a good time to talk ? ”
86283	86296	86297	86297	I	94	“ Yes , this is a great time . How are you ? ”
86312	86340	86297	86297	I	94	“ I ’m well , thank you . I ’m glad we ’re finally getting a chance to talk . It seems my timing is always off . ”
86418	86449	86561	86561	he	370	“ I ’m sorry I did n’t call you back last night . Dinner went a little late , and I was n’t sure how long you usually stay up . ”
86450	86471	86561	86561	he	370	“ You can call me anytime . I mean it . Day or night , do n’t hesitate to call . ”
86472	86475	86476	86476	I	94	“ Okay . ”
86496	86509	86476	86476	I	94	“ Thanks . Um , are you in your own place now ? ”
86510	86554	86564	86565	his wife	2245	“ Yes . We agreed she ’d stay in the house while the lawyers fight over the details of who gets to keep what . I ’ve rented a place overlooking Central Park . The view is spectacular . You ’d love it . ”
86574	86577	86561	86561	he	370	“ she , ”
86600	86611	86589	86589	he	370	“ I ’m sure I would . It sounds beautiful . ”
86629	86641	86626	86626	Michael	370	“ Okay , I have to get this off my chest . ”
86649	86654	86626	86626	Michael	370	“ What is it ? ”
86665	86674	86655	86655	He	370	“ I ’m jealous of your rugby player . ”
86775	86808	86763	86763	Michael	370	“ You do n’t need to be jealous of him . I was telling you the truth when I said we were friends . There ’s really nothing going on between us . ”
86816	86862	86809	86809	Michael	370	“ That ’s good to hear . I know I do n’t have any right to be jealous , but honestly I ’ve thought about you for so long it would probably break my heart if you were taken the moment I was set free . ”
86887	86894	86895	86895	I	94	“ You ’ve thought about me ? ”
86914	86940	86908	86908	His	370	“ You must ’ve known . My God , the amount of time I ’ve spent staring at you , I was afraid everyone knew . ”
86984	86991	86964	86965	this man	370	“ You ’re not saying anything . ”
86992	87006	87007	87007	My	94	“ Sorry , I ’m just . . . soaking it all in . ”
87020	87030	87007	87007	My	94	“ I ’m having a hard time believing it . ”
87031	87051	87007	87007	My	94	“ You should n’t be . You ’re a beautiful girl , Joellen . I ’ve always thought so . ”
87167	87173	87174	87174	I	94	“ Are you still there ? ”
87199	87207	87208	87208	Michael	370	“ I was just thinking about Portia . ”
87216	87223	87208	87208	Michael	370	“ Portia ? What about her ? ”
87224	87234	87208	87208	Michael	370	“ I think she has a crush on you . ”
87242	87267	87235	87235	Michael	370	“ You ’re giving her too much credit . If she had a crush on me , it would mean she had a heart ! ”
87283	87294	87280	87280	Michael	370	“ Besides , I do n’t have the right equipment . ”
87300	87304	87295	87295	I	94	“ Excuse me ? ”
87305	87310	87280	87280	Michael	370	“ Portia ’s gay . ”
87341	87348	87311	87311	I	94	“ Gay ? Portia ’s gay ? ”
87349	87364	87295	87295	I	94	“ A lesbian , yes . Do n’t tell me you did n’t know . ”
87379	87390	87370	87370	I	94	“ I had no idea ! How do you know ? ”
87391	87428	87462	87462	she	340	“ I ’ve met her girlfriend . They ’ve been together for years . Portia and my wife serve together on the board of a national literacy organization . We ’ve seen them socially many times . ”
87500	87527	87462	87462	she	340	“ Wow . I honestly had no clue . I wonder why she never brought her girlfriend to any of the holiday parties or summer picnics ? ”
87534	87549	87462	87462	she	340	“ I think she was concerned how it would be viewed by the staff . ”
87550	87571	87462	87462	she	340	“ What do you mean , ‘ viewed ’ ? You think she ’s worried she ’ll be discriminated against ? ”
87572	87577	87462	87462	she	340	“ Well , naturally . ”
87578	87635	87462	87462	she	340	“ I do n’t understand . Why ‘ naturally ’ ? I know a dozen gay people at Maddox who are out , and no one gives them grief . The company culture is very inclusive , but even if it were n’t , we have written policies against discrimination . And there ’s federal law — ”
87636	87651	87462	87462	she	340	“ No one in a position of authority is openly gay in the company . ”
87661	87666	87667	87667	I	94	“ That ’s true , ”
87700	87744	87689	87689	Michael	370	“ I ’ve encouraged her to take a leadership role in that regard , of course , but she does n’t feel comfortable . And it is n’t my place to insist . I respect her wishes to keep her private life private . ”
87745	87757	87684	87684	he	1312	“ Yes , of course , if she ’s not comfortable — ”
87758	87764	87765	87765	Michael	370	“ But enough about Portia , ”
87768	87795	87765	87765	Michael	370	“ Let ’s talk about you . Have you been working out ? Because I noticed you seem to be looking a bit tighter of late . ”
87836	87845	87846	87846	I	94	“ Yes , I have been working out , ”
87850	87885	87846	87846	I	94	“ That ’s the project I told you Cam was helping me with . I decided to start exercising and eating better , and you know , he ’s a professional athlete , so . ”
87886	87893	87894	87894	I	94	“ That ’s great , Joellen ! ”
87927	87955	87894	87894	I	94	“ I ’m very happy for you . I love to work out , too . Maybe we could work out together ! Do you like squash ? ”
87956	87967	87968	87968	I	94	“ Oh , sure . . . I love squash . ”
87978	87996	87894	87894	I	94	“ Great ! When I get back from London , I ’ll take you to my club . ”
87997	88004	87894	87894	I	94	“ You ’re going to London ? ”
88005	88051	87894	87894	I	94	“ Yes . I leave tomorrow . I ’ve been meaning to tell you , but I have n’t had the chance . I ’ve got meetings with some of our European distributors , but I ’ll be back on Saturday the twenty - third . ”
88060	88079	88053	88053	I	94	“ That ’s the day of the office holiday party . Are you still going to make it ? ”
88084	88094	88080	88080	His	94	“ I would n’t miss it for the world . ”
88104	88129	88168	88168	I	94	“ Okay . Um . . . maybe we can email while you ’re gone ? You know , just to keep in touch ? ”
88130	88136	88137	88137	he	94	“ I ’d like that , ”
88140	88151	88137	88137	he	94	“ I ’d like that very much . And Joellen ? ”
88152	88155	88168	88168	I	94	“ Yes ? ”
88156	88167	88137	88137	he	94	“ I ’m so glad we finally got to talk . ”
88171	88175	88168	88168	I	94	“ Me too . ”
88347	88371	88449	88449	He	366	“ You ’re lookin ’ me up again , are n’t you , lass ? Tch . It ’s becomin ’ an obsession ! ”
88372	88410	88449	88449	He	366	“ Get over yourself , prancer . There ’s a whole big world out there that does n’t involve you . I ’m trying to find out how to play squash . Who ’re the flowers for ? ”
88421	88432	88411	88411	He	366	“ Is there someone else who lives in this apartment ? ”
88440	88448	88437	88437	I	94	“ They ’re for me ? Really ? ”
88457	88484	88449	88449	He	366	“ Christ on a crutch , Miss Snufflebottom , you ’re hopeless . Take the bloody things before I smack you upside the head with ’em . ”
88498	88504	88485	88485	I	94	“ These are my favorite . ”
88515	88540	88507	88507	I	94	“ They always remind me of home . My mom got them fresh from the farmers market every Friday when I was growing up . ”
88541	88545	88590	88590	He	366	“ I know . ”
88555	88566	88546	88546	I	94	“ Have you been going through my trash or something ? ”
88570	88578	88567	88567	He	366	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle enjoys a good gossip . ”
88582	88589	88567	88567	He	366	“ True . But . . . ”
88600	88617	88590	88590	He	366	“ It ’s our last supper , lass . The occasion seemed to call for flowers . ”
88618	88627	88628	88628	I	94	“ That sounds uncomfortably biblical , but thanks . ”
88638	88648	88628	88628	I	94	“ I see you discovered you own a razor . ”
88657	88670	88649	88649	He	366	“ Aye . I was startin ’ to appear a bit cavemannish . ”
88677	88704	88649	88649	He	366	“ You fancy the proper pretty boy look , so I thought it bein ’ a special night and all , I ’d make an effort . ”
88705	88711	88712	88712	I	94	“ Scruff suits you better , ”
88717	88737	88712	88712	I	94	“ You ’re way too manly to be overgroomed . All your rough edges are much more . . . ”
88762	88770	88755	88755	I	94	“ Oh , shut up , prancer , ”
88784	88796	88797	88797	Cam	366	“ No , I do n’t think I will , lassie , ”
88803	88816	88817	88817	He	366	“ At least not until you tell me how that sentence ends . ”
88836	88849	88850	88850	I	94	“ It ends with me jabbing a sharp object into your eye . ”
88898	88905	88906	88906	he	366	“ Hot ? Sexy ? Devastating ? ”
88915	88931	88906	88906	he	366	“ Hmm . She ’s mute on the subject . I must be g’tting close . ”
88932	88945	88906	88906	he	366	“ You ’re getting close to serious bodily injury . Be quiet . ”
89011	89020	89038	89038	I	94	“ How come you never smile in photographs ? ”
89060	89093	89109	89109	he	366	“ I mean , I see you smiling and laughing all the time , like you are right now , but in pictures you always look kind of . . . miserable . ”
89112	89121	89109	89109	he	366	“ You ca n’t really be that naïve . ”
89133	89139	89122	89122	His	366	“ What do you mean ? ”
89140	89166	89122	89122	His	366	“ I mean spend a little time thinkin ’ about what you just asked me , woman , and you ’ll find your goddamn answer . ”
89190	89206	89181	89181	he	366	“ Why are you mad at me ? You said I could ask you anything ! ”
89255	89260	89261	89261	He	366	“ Ah , lassie . ”
89276	89285	89269	89269	His	366	“ You ’ll be the death of me . ”
89286	89315	89316	89316	He	366	“ Yeah , maybe , if you keep acting like a dick . In case you have n’t noticed , I ’ve got pruning shears in my hand . ”
89352	89360	89361	89361	I	94	“ You ’re so friggin ’ weird , ”
89370	89389	89361	89361	I	94	“ And you ca n’t see past the end of your nose , but here we are anyway . ”
89390	89417	89361	89361	I	94	“ You and your ambiguous statements are gon na be the death of me , prancer . Speaking of bad vision , I have a question . ”
89427	89433	89422	89422	I	94	“ Of course you do . ”
89434	89444	89361	89361	I	94	“ Do you think I should ditch the glasses ? ”
89445	89452	89422	89422	I	94	“ For what , a monocle ? ”
89453	89459	89460	89460	I	94	“ Yes , a monocle , ”
89464	89483	89460	89460	I	94	“ They ’re so in style . Can you be serious for a second ? This is important . ”
89494	89512	89484	89484	He	366	“ Aye . This is me bein ’ serious . You can tell by my forbidding brow . ”
89535	89560	89568	89568	He	366	“ Okay , okay . Do n’t put a hex on me . The question is if I think you should ditch your glasses ? ”
89561	89567	89568	89568	He	366	“ That is the question . ”
89589	89601	89602	89602	I	94	“ Take a picture , prancer , it ’ll last longer , ”
89607	89627	89638	89638	Cam	366	“ I ’m tryin ’ to decide how to phrase somethin’ so it wo n’t offend your missish nerves . ”
89628	89637	89638	89638	Cam	366	“ Missish ? Is that even a word ? ”
89642	89655	89638	89638	Cam	366	“ Oh , the fancy editor lady has n’t heard of it ? ”
89667	89676	89664	89664	he	366	“ It means demure . Squeamish . Prudish . ”
89677	89685	89638	89638	Cam	366	“ You ’re calling me a prude ? ”
89692	89749	89689	89689	his	366	“ No man who ’s ever kissed you would call you a prude , darlin ’ . What I ’m sayin ’ is that you ’re highly sensitive about your looks . One misplaced word and you ’ll be locked in your room makin ’ a list of all the ways you think you ’re ugly . ”
89872	89874	89852	89852	I	94	“ cankles ”
89876	89879	89852	89852	I	94	“ weird moles ”
89906	89918	89920	89920	Cam	366	“ Do n’t break your brain overanalyzin ’ that , Joellen , ”
89923	89940	89941	89941	He	366	“ I ca n’t help it . My brain is set to think things to death . ”
89946	89952	89941	89941	He	366	“ You do n’t say ? ”
89965	89981	89941	89941	He	366	“ All right . Here ’s what I think about you ditchin ’ your glasses . ”
89999	90009	90019	90019	Lord	1326	“ I do n’t think you should do it . ”
90030	90048	90019	90019	Lord	1326	“ I have contact lenses , but I never wear them because they make my eyes red . ”
90049	90056	90057	90057	he	366	“ Thank you for sharin ’ , ”
90060	90076	90057	90057	he	366	“ Ask me why I do n’t think you should get rid of your glasses . ”
90077	90091	90019	90019	Lord	1326	“ Why do n’t you think I should get rid of my glasses ? ”
90092	90117	90057	90057	he	366	“ Because they make you look smart , and sexy , and like you do n’t give a fuck , which is also sexy . ”
90118	90121	90122	90122	I	94	“ Oh . ”
90144	90150	90057	90057	he	366	“ I was n’t finished . ”
90167	90216	90295	90295	He	1327	“ The main reason I do n’t think you should get rid of them is because you prefer them . If you did n’t , you ’d wear your contacts or get laser surgery . But you like your glasses , so that ’s what you should wear . ”
90217	90231	90295	90295	He	1327	“ But . . . do n’t most guys think they ’re dorky ? ”
90232	90294	90295	90295	He	1327	“ The number of fucks you should give about what men think of how you look is zero , lass . Every choice you make about your appearance should be about what makes you feel good , not what makes some random lad — or your mother — think you ’re cute . Do n’t set aside your preferences for anyone . ”
90327	90478	90295	90295	He	1327	“ And another thing . Learn to stop saying ‘ Sorry , ’ and say ‘ Do n’t interrupt me . ’ Learn to say ‘ No ’ and ‘ None of your business . ’ Learn to be unapologetic for who you are and what you like and the opinions you hold . I know you think that if other people considered you beautiful , all your problems would be solved , but you ’d just have different problems . And they ’d all still revolve around the fact that deep down , you do n’t think you ’re good enough . That ’s a lie you learned , and you can unlearn it , but it has to start with you . You have to decide to accept yourself . It ’s cliché , but you really do have to love yourself before you can love anyone else . ”
90501	90562	90479	90479	He	1328	“ My mother was one of the most beautiful women I ’ve ever seen , but she killed herself over a man who was n’t even worthy to breathe the same air she did . Total fucking waste . All because she did n’t think she was good enough . A lie life pounded into her that she never unlearned . ”
90563	90571	90479	90479	He	1328	“ You ’re talking about Sir Gladstone ? ”
90579	90672	90673	90673	He	1328	“ Aye . That worthless piece of shit . Thought he could run roughshod over anyone because he was rich . He treated his house staff like slaves , allowing them no voices or power , giving them no appreciation . Unless you were pretty , and then you got the kind of attention a broken soul can confuse with love . He used her for years , until a younger housemaid came along . Then he acted like he never knew my mother . She was replaced , just like that . ”
90678	90762	90673	90673	He	1328	“ I saw the whole thing comin ’ , but she ’d never hear a word spoken against him . She thought because he came into her room a few nights a week and let me play rugby with his spoiled fucking children , that meant he loved her . But he did n’t . And when she found out , it killed her . She went up to the roof and threw herself off without even tellin ’ me good - bye . ”
90784	90794	90768	90768	I	94	“ Oh , Cam . I ’m so sorry . ”
90811	90817	90795	90795	He	94	“ Aye . Me too . ”
90838	90842	90818	90818	He	94	“ Stand up , ”
90851	90859	90843	90843	I	94	“ I ’m giving you a hug . ”
90948	90953	90954	90954	he	94	“ Promise me something , ”
90960	90963	90954	90954	he	94	“ What ? ”
90964	90978	90954	90954	he	94	“ No matter what happens with Michael , we ’ll still be friends . ”
90979	90990	90954	90954	he	94	“ I thought you did n’t want to be friends . ”
91000	91008	90991	90991	His	94	“ God , you ’re an idiot . ”
91009	91026	91027	91027	I	94	“ That ’s probably not something you should say to someone with low self - esteem , ”
91048	91066	91030	91030	He	94	“ Aye , but you know I say it with love , lass . Always with love . ”
91710	91713	91729	91730	Joellen Bixby	126	“ Barely contained ”
91940	91942	91933	91933	I	94	“ risqué ”
92537	92547	92526	92526	She	173	“ Can I shag the CEO without getting fired ? ”
92855	92859	92860	92860	I	94	“ Holy cow , ”
92871	92877	92860	92860	I	94	“ I got the position ! ”
92928	92938	92961	92962	a woman	358	“ Cam ! Are you home ? Open up ! ”
92942	92946	92949	92949	he	366	“ Comin ’ ! ”
92987	92992	93052	93052	He	366	“ Um . . . ”
92993	92996	92997	92997	He	366	“ What ? ”
93003	93018	93019	93019	He	366	“ Oh , this ? It was in Kellen ’s closet . Looked comfy . ”
93022	93027	92997	92997	He	366	“ It is comfy . “
93028	93051	93052	93052	He	366	“ I admire that for such a big , manly man , you have very open ideas about gender - specific clothing . ”
93055	93084	93052	93052	He	366	“ Whoever made that rule that pink is only for girls is dumb . I ’ll have you know , pink is very flatterin ’ to my complexion . ”
93099	93120	93121	93121	I	94	“ Moving on — I got the promotion ! You ’re looking at the newest associate editor at Maddox Publishing ! ”
93145	93163	92997	92997	He	366	“ Really ? That ’s fantastic , lass ! Good for you ! You just found out ? ”
93164	93214	93121	93121	I	94	“ Yes , Michael emailed me the news ! I ’m not supposed to tell anyone until after the first of the year when they make the formal announcement , but I had to tell you . Oh God , wait until my mother hears — she’ll freak out ! ”
93215	93225	92997	92997	He	366	“ You told me before you told your mum ? ”
93239	93273	93226	93226	I	94	“ Why do I feel like that ’s going to be followed with a lecture about how much I ’m in love with you , but I just do n’t realize it yet ? ”
93274	93284	93285	93285	He	1368	“ Because you are , and you do n’t . ”
93294	93314	93285	93285	He	1368	“ This calls for a celebration . You have any of that dark beer you bought for me left ? ”
93358	93371	93346	93347	the man	366	“ Your ego is your superpower , you know that , prancer ? ”
93402	93415	93416	93416	He	366	“ Oh , no , lass , that ’s not my superpower . ”
93423	93440	93416	93416	He	366	“ You ’re never gon na let me forget I saw you naked , are you ? ”
93441	93457	93416	93416	He	366	“ I ’ll forget it as soon as you do . So no , never . ”
93527	93537	93538	93538	He	366	“ Why are n’t you dressed for bed yet ? ”
93547	93563	93538	93538	He	366	“ It ’s almost ten o’clock on a school night . You need your sleep . ”
93569	93591	93566	93566	me	94	“ You ’ll make a good dad someday , you know that ? You ’re bossy in a very sweet way . ”
93607	93619	93593	93593	he	366	“ Not in love with you . Just making an observation . ”
93620	93635	93593	93593	he	366	“ Well , thank you . I ’ve always wanted to be a father . ”
93636	93650	93593	93593	he	366	“ You have tons of time . What are you , early thirties ? ”
93651	93666	93593	93593	he	366	“ Do n’t tell me you did n’t find out during your investigative research . ”
93685	93724	93674	93674	he	366	“ Ugh . I only looked you up that one time , and I did n’t pay attention to your birth date . So — are you going to tell me , or is it a state secret ? ”
93725	93732	93774	93774	he	366	“ I ’m twenty - nine . ”
93768	93773	93774	93774	he	366	“ Uh - oh , ”
93783	93796	93774	93774	he	366	“ She ’s thinkin ’ . No good can come of this . ”
93837	93867	93829	93829	he	366	“ I remember twenty - nine . It was actually harder than thirty . Once I was over that hump , I accepted I ’d never be young again . ”
93868	93898	93797	93797	I	94	“ Everything ’s relative , lass . There ’s a sixty - year - old grandma out there who ’d give her eyeteeth to be thirty - six again . ”
93899	93921	93829	93829	he	366	“ Oh , thank you for that pearl of wisdom . How comforting to know the elderly are jealous of me . ”
93922	93928	93797	93797	I	94	“ Sixty is n’t elderly ! ”
93929	93954	93829	93829	he	366	“ Dude . Seriously . If the average life expectancy is somewhere in the seventies , sixty is practically knocking on death ’s door . ”
93955	93968	93797	93797	I	94	“ One of my grandmothers lived to be one hundred and fourteen . ”
93969	93977	93829	93829	he	366	“ What ? That ’s a lie ! ”
93978	93996	93797	93797	I	94	“ Nope . And my other grandmother is one hundred and ten . She ’s still alive . ”
94004	94016	93997	93997	I	94	“ Now you ’re just trying to make me feel better . ”
94017	94051	93829	93829	he	366	“ I ’m not pullin ’ your leg ! The McGregor clan has exceptional genes , lass . Nobody in my family even starts thinkin ’ about retirin ’ until well after ninety . ”
94052	94055	93997	93997	I	94	“ Really ? ”
94056	94104	93829	93829	he	366	“ Really . If you ever visit Scotland , I ’ll take you to meet Nanny O’Shea . That ’s my mum ’s mum . You two would get a kick out of each other — same sharp tongue and lack of respect for the McGregor men . ”
94139	94246	94247	94247	I	94	“ My dad ’s mother is eighty . We call her Granny Gums because she loves to horrify people by popping out her dentures during conversations like it ’s an accident . She has mild dementia , so she repeats herself a lot , but otherwise she ’s in pretty good shape . My other grandmother is in perfect health , but you would n’t know it by the way she carries on . She had a Just Buried party when she turned fifty because she was convinced she was about to kick the bucket any minute . She was a model , like my mom . ”
94306	94322	94323	94323	Cam	366	“ Those people do not age gracefully , and I ’m not talking about wrinkles . ”
94340	94343	94323	94323	Cam	366	“ What ? ”
94344	94372	94323	94323	Cam	366	“ Clink your glass with me , lass . That ’s the first time you ’ve said somethin’ sensible about age , looks , or your family . ”
94373	94382	94383	94383	We	1383	“ Maybe you ’re rubbing off on me . ”
94410	94431	94400	94401	The man	366	“ I have a chicken breast and some veggies left over from dinner I could reheat if you ’re hungry . ”
94450	94468	94432	94432	Cam	366	“ Only if it ’s no bother , lass . I do n’t wanna keep you up . ”
94478	94488	94469	94469	I	94	“ Oh , shut up , you big baby . ”
94640	94652	94654	94654	Cam	366	“ So what else did pretty boy say in his email ? ”
94670	94685	94660	94660	I	94	“ My laptop ’s on the bed if you want to check it out . ”
94718	94723	94691	94691	he	366	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
94724	94735	94691	94691	he	366	“ I like him better in email than in person . ”
94743	94757	94738	94738	me	94	“ Oh ho ! So you admit Mr. Repressed has a cute side ! ”
94764	94802	94803	94803	His	366	“ I said no such thing . Let ’s not get carried away , lass . I ’m just admittin ’ he might have a certain charm in electronic communications that does n’t translate into real life . ”
94807	94821	94803	94803	His	366	“ Even if he was tryin ’ to get you to send nudes . ”
94822	94850	94899	94899	I	94	“ Yeah , but I remembered what you said about dropping crumbs , so I took your advice and sent him a picture of my earlobe instead . ”
94851	94867	94868	94868	He	366	“ Seems like it worked . Pretty boy ’s fallin ’ all over himself here . ”
94879	94898	94868	94868	He	366	“ Did you read this part about the policy against subordinates and supervisors bein ’ in a relationship ? ”
94913	94933	94899	94899	I	94	“ Yeah . It ’s a bummer , but I guess we ’ll just have to be extra careful . ”
94934	94950	94899	94899	I	94	“ Extra careful as in not sendin ’ emails like this over the company server ? ”
94956	94960	94951	94951	I	94	“ Oh shit . ”
94961	94972	94899	94899	I	94	“ Aye , oh shit is right . Dumb ass . ”
94982	94992	94975	94975	I	94	“ Did you just call me a dumb ass ? ”
94993	95024	94951	94951	I	94	“ I ’m callin ’ him a dumb ass , because he is , because he should fucking know better ! He ’s the CEO , for Christ ’s sake ! ”
95025	95033	94975	94975	I	94	“ I should know better , too ! ”
95044	95064	95065	95065	He	366	“ Aye . But you ’re a woman in love . They ’re always blind as fuckin ’ bats . ”
95071	95118	95065	95065	He	366	“ Sorry . Not to lump you in with the rest of your gender , but in my personal experience , a woman loses her damn mind when she falls in love . And most of the time she loses herself in the process , too . ”
95147	95214	95129	95129	I	94	“ I ’ll go in and delete everything later . I ’ll make sure he does , too . I do n’t think there ’s anything too incriminating . We ’re not admitting we ’re in a relationship , we ’re just talking about the possibilities . Besides , it wo n’t be a problem unless someone is looking for something , which they are n’t . ”
95359	95377	95348	95348	I	94	“ You havin’ a breakdown over there , lassie ? Do I need to call the paramedics ? ”
95378	95399	95400	95400	My	94	“ No . I ’m just beginning to realize this thing with Michael might be more complicated than I thought . ”
95405	95426	95400	95400	My	94	“ Or did n’t think . It was never a possibility before , not really . But now . . . ”
95434	95441	95431	95431	Cam	366	“ Reality ’s settin ’ in . ”
95442	95454	95431	95431	Cam	366	“ I literally thought those exact words not two minutes ago . ”
95455	95467	95431	95431	Cam	366	“ Great minds think alike . Is my dinner ready yet ? ”
95477	95488	95472	95472	I	94	“ Yes , evil overlord , your dinner is ready . ”
95521	95541	95472	95472	I	94	“ Why are you eating so late , anyway ? You told me I should n’t eat after seven p.m. ”
95650	95659	95660	95660	he	366	“ Did n’t eat today except for lunch , ”
95672	95692	95660	95660	he	366	“ Do n’t have much in the apartment except stuff for our mornin ’ shakes and the odd sandwich . ”
95693	95710	95660	95660	he	366	“ So go shopping ! What have you been doing for dinner since our last supper ? ”
95716	95719	95711	95711	He	366	“ Nothin’ . ”
95724	95745	95720	95720	I	94	“ You have n’t been eating ? How do you have the energy to do our workouts in the morning ? ”
95754	95768	95746	95746	He	366	“ ’ Tis the thought of you that keeps me goin’ , lass . ”
95775	95811	95769	95769	My	94	“ Okay . That ’s it . We ’re going back to our nightly dinners . I ca n’t have my trainer dying on me — I’m almost halfway to my weight - loss goal . ”
95830	95839	95820	95820	He	366	“ You have a specific number in mind ? ”
95840	95867	95812	95812	Cam	366	“ Yeah . Forty pounds . What did you think this was about , my love for kale and early - morning jogs in subzero temperatures ? ”
95868	95882	95820	95820	He	366	“ Forty pounds ? I thought you just wanted to get into shape ? ”
95883	95890	95812	95812	Cam	366	“ I do ! I am ! ”
95909	95921	95820	95820	He	366	“ What ’s that look ? You ’re making me nervous . ”
95922	95951	95820	95820	He	366	“ It ’s your body , lass . If you wanna shrink it , that ’s your decision . But if I could offer an opinion . . . ”
95952	95958	95820	95820	He	366	“ Sure . Go ahead . ”
95963	96027	95959	95959	He	366	“ You look great . Truly . If you were payin ’ me to be your trainer , I ’d advise you to stop tryin ’ to lose weight and focus on healthy eatin ’ habits and gainin ’ strength , endurance , and flexibility from your workouts . And , most importantly , practicin ’ gratitude for the body you ’ve got . ”
96028	96032	96033	96033	I	94	“ Practicing gratitude , ”
96040	96079	96037	96037	He	366	“ You ’re healthy . You ’re whole . Your body does whatever you ask it to . There are millions of people who live with chronic pain or physical disabilities who would gladly trade places with you . ”
96094	96203	96091	96091	he	366	“ Your body is n’t a thing to be looked at and judged against some standard of perfection that does n’t even really exist . It ’s the vessel that takes you through life , allowin ’ you to experience all the beautiful things life has to offer . Food . Sex . Sunsets . Music . Hugs . Laughter . A healthy body is a gift . Do n’t take it for granted . Do n’t treat it like some cheap one - night stand . Treat it like the love of your life . Treat it with respect and tenderness , but most of all , gratitude .
96204	96312	96313	96313	He	366	“ And a healthy dose of awe , too . Your body is made of remnants of stars and massive explosions in the galaxies . Every few years , the bulk of your body is newly created by the regeneration of your cells , but you have things in you that are as old as the universe . We ’re literally stardust . Every one of us is a little miracle . You ’re a miracle , Joellen . Think about that the next time you ’re standin ’ naked in front of the mirror and want to focus on some stray dimple you do n’t like . ”
96342	96351	96353	96353	Cam	366	“ You ’re thinkin ’ again , lass , ”
96357	96366	96353	96353	Cam	366	“ I can hear the gears turnin ’ . ”
96367	96379	96313	96313	He	366	“ There ’s no way you ’re only twenty - nine . ”
96388	96413	96380	96380	He	366	“ Why , ’cause I ’m so enlightened ? Maybe I ’m the latest reincarnation of the Buddha , you ever think of that ? ”
96414	96432	96433	96433	Cam	366	“ Oh yes . You ’re very enlightened . I can tell from the girly pink robe . ”
96443	96446	96447	96447	he	366	“ Exactly , ”
96450	96502	96447	96447	he	366	“ Great title for another sonnet about me , don’tcha think ? ‘ The Man in the Girly Pink Robe . ’ I can see it now . Full o ’ tender endearments about my extreme lovability . You can work on it tomorrow and show it to me at dinner . ”
96691	96699	96700	96700	I	94	“ I must be getting my period , ”
96711	96716	96700	96700	I	94	“ This is ridiculous . ”
96978	96984	96985	96985	she	340	“ You ’ve had enough , ”
97111	97114	97106	97106	you	1406	“ ethnic , ”
97345	97367	97339	97339	I	94	“ You know what ? A wise woman once said , ‘ Fuck this shit ’ and lived happily ever after . ”
97417	97435	97438	97439	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Any day now , lassie . We could be dead by the time you come out ! ”
97518	97527	97536	97536	she	1817	“ Heavens , Ducky ! You ’re beautiful ! ”
97546	97552	97536	97536	she	1817	“ How ’s the hair ? ”
97558	97566	97553	97553	I	94	“ I used your hot oil treatment . ”
97590	97619	97583	97583	she	1817	“ Oh , my dear , it ’s simply perfect . Perfect ! How did you get it up like that ? What a lovely , chic twist ! ”
97620	97623	97624	97624	I	94	“ YouTube , ”
97628	97635	97624	97624	I	94	“ They have really good tutorials . ”
97700	97703	97688	97688	I	94	“ Well ? ”
97713	97728	97710	97710	he	366	“ Let ’s just say I ’m glad I ’m already sittin ’ down . ”
97737	97746	97731	97731	I	94	“ I ’m taking that as a compliment . ”
97747	97782	97791	97791	he	366	“ Aye . It ’s a compliment . But if you knew what I was really thinkin ’ , lass , you ’d run back into that bedroom and bolt the door behind you . ”
97819	97839	97796	97796	He	366	“ But we need to take it in a bit , Ducky . It ’s a little loose here ! ”
97857	97873	97840	97841	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ You ’re right . I ’ve lost weight since I bought this . Shoot . ”
97874	97961	97840	97841	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ No worries , my dear , just take it off for a minute , and I ’ll fix it up for you ! I ’m an expert seamstress , of course . All those years on the stage , I accumulated more than just men , let me tell you . My skills with a needle and thread are legendary . Tut , tut , in you go , take it off , put on a robe , and I ’ll bring it right back ! ”
98016	98022	98023	98024	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Back in a jiff ! ”
98037	98046	98023	98024	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ You ’re not wearin ’ your glasses . ”
98061	98099	98055	98055	I	94	“ I ’ve got my contacts in . I decided to go whole hog with the transformation thing . I want everyone to not recognize me when I walk into the party . I want to slay . ”
98100	98132	98162	98162	He	94	“ Oh , you ’ll slay , lass . No doubt about that . But it ’s really because pretty boy wanted to see you without them , is n’t it ? ”
98156	98161	98140	98140	I	94	“ Is that bad ? ”
98213	98216	98217	98217	he	94	“ No , ”
98226	98264	98217	98217	he	94	“ It ’s not bad . You want to please your man — I get it . Just do n’t forget who you are . Do n’t forget what you are , Joellen . Not for anyone . ”
98285	98290	98291	98291	I	94	“ What am I ? ”
98299	98302	98303	98303	He	94	“ Perfect . ”
98529	98538	98539	98539	I	94	“ God , I really need a drink , ”
98557	98562	98583	98584	Maddox Publishing	4	“ You like bourbon ? ”
98575	98582	98570	98570	I	94	“ Not even a little bit . ”
98965	98968	98969	98969	She	1439	“ Shasta . ”
98986	98993	98969	98969	She	1439	“ Joellen ? Is that you ? ”
98994	99005	98969	98969	She	1439	“ It ’s not like I ’m wearing a disguise . ”
99014	99041	99006	99006	She	1439	“ You might as well be , bitch ! You da bomb . Who knew you had those titties stashed away under all those ugly sweaters ? ”
99053	99060	99048	99048	I	94	“ Let ’s get a drink . ”
99166	99178	99179	99179	I	94	“ I ’ll have a glass of red wine , please , ”
99218	99222	99223	99223	Shasta	125	“ Vodka rocks , ”
99257	99267	99247	99247	I	94	“ Easy , killer ! The night ’s young . ”
99268	99275	99276	99276	she	58	“ Broke up with the boyfriend , ”
99283	99296	99276	99276	she	58	“ Walked in on the son of a bitch with another girl . ”
99297	99307	99247	99247	I	94	“ Oh , Shasta , I ’m so sorry ! ”
99311	99349	99308	99308	She	58	“ I knew it was n’t going to last when we went on vacation to Bermuda over Thanksgiving and he clapped when the plane landed . No self - respecting woman can marry a man like that . ”
99358	99363	99350	99350	I	94	“ To being single . ”
99364	99369	99370	99370	she	58	“ To being single , ”
99373	99383	99370	99370	she	58	“ Next I think I ’ll become a lesbian . ”
99384	99396	99350	99350	I	94	“ I ’m pretty sure it does n’t work like that . ”
99542	99551	99552	99552	I	94	“ I have to go to the bathroom . ”
99654	99660	99661	99661	I	94	“ I do n’t understand , ”
99666	99672	99661	99661	I	94	“ I do n’t understand . ”
99742	99745	99774	99774	Michael	370	“ Joellen ? ”
99756	99773	99746	99746	I	94	“ In case you have n’t noticed , this is the ladies ’ room , asshole ! ”
99789	99794	99774	99774	Michael	370	“ You ’re angry . ”
99795	99814	99774	99774	Michael	370	“ And you ’re here with your wife . I wonder how the two could possibly be related ? ”
99815	99836	99774	99774	Michael	370	“ Can you please come out ? I do n’t want to have this conversation through a toilet stall door . ”
99954	99957	99958	99958	He	370	“ Please . ”
99996	100021	99983	99983	I	94	“ You have exactly ten seconds to say your piece , and then I ’m going to kick you in the balls . Go . ”
100031	100040	100028	100028	his	370	“ It is n’t what it looks like . ”
100049	100059	100041	100041	I	94	“ Seriously ? You expect me to believe that ? ”
100060	100074	100041	100041	I	94	“ Just hear me out . I told you our divorce was amicable — ”
100075	100118	100041	100041	I	94	“ No . No , you did not tell me that . You said she was living in the house and you got a new place while the attorneys were working out the details . That was the extent of your explanation . ”
100129	100145	100119	100119	He	370	“ I apologize . I should ’ve made it clearer . Our divorce is amicable . ”
100146	100175	100041	100041	I	94	“ Yeah , we ’re past that . Get to the important part where you ’re attending the company holiday party together , looking all married and happy . ”
100181	100225	100176	100176	His	370	“ My father thought it would be good for morale . You know , for the staff to see that things are calm and friendly between us . Many times in cases like ours , family companies are broken up in bitter divorces . ”
100262	100294	100258	100258	he	370	“ We do n’t have a prenup . If Elizabeth wanted to , she could insist on the sale of the company so the proceeds could be evenly split between us . ”
100306	100325	100258	100258	he	370	“ But the company ’s been around for a million years ! Way before you two were married ! ”
100329	100415	100326	100326	Michael	370	“ Yes . It has . But since I took over as CEO , we ’ve tripled in size , and so have our profits . She could argue in court that those profits are marital assets . I ’d fight it , of course , but if I lost , I ’d have to buy her out to the tune of more than one hundred million dollars . I do n’t have that kind of cash . The only way would be to sell . ”
100442	100454	100436	100436	He	370	“ Not to change the subject , but you look incredible . ”
100470	100473	100463	100463	I	94	“ Thanks . ”
100474	100479	100480	100480	he	370	“ I ’m sorry , ”
100489	100519	100480	100480	he	370	“ I know it must ’ve been a shock , seeing us like that . I honestly did n’t know until late this afternoon that she ’d be coming . ”
100577	100584	100585	100585	he	370	“ You really do look incredible , ”
100588	100610	100585	100585	he	370	“ This dress is . . . wow . And your hair . My God , Joellen . You ’re stunning . ”
100632	100640	100621	100621	his	370	“ I ’m glad you like it . ”
100653	100671	100641	100641	He	370	“ I do n’t like it . I love it . You ’ve made me your slave . ”
100694	100711	100672	100672	He	370	“ Now if only you ’d get rid of those glasses , you ’d be perfect . ”
100768	100774	100762	100762	he	370	“ You ’ve had enough . ”
100851	100863	100841	100841	I	94	“ We should go . Someone could walk in any minute . ”
100864	100877	100878	100878	He	370	“ That only makes it more exciting , do n’t you think ? ”
100917	100927	100914	100914	his	370	“ Whoa ! Okay . Let ’s cool it — ”
100928	100941	100942	100942	he	370	“ I could n’t stop thinking about you while I was gone , ”
100990	101010	101011	101011	He	370	“ You enjoyed teasing me over email , did n’t you ? Sending me that photo of your earlobe . ”
101019	101035	101011	101011	He	370	“ Clever . If it was your plan to make me obsessed , it worked . ”
101048	101057	101042	101042	he	370	“ No , there was really no plan — ”
101109	101117	101118	101118	He	370	“ Michael ! You ’re hurting me ! ”
101141	101173	101125	101125	I	94	“ Dude ! Get a grip ! I ’m not making out with you in a bathroom ! In case you did n’t hear me , I just said cool it ! ”
101265	101268	101269	101269	He	370	“ Ow ! ”
101338	101343	101365	101365	He	370	“ Let me go ! ”
101344	101351	101352	101352	He	370	“ She likes to play rough . ”
101360	101364	101352	101352	He	370	“ Me too . ”
101398	101405	101393	101393	he	370	“ Stop . Michael , stop ! ”
101406	101444	101445	101445	He	370	“ Oh , come on , Joellen , do n’t be coy . We both know what we ’re doing . You wanted a promotion , right ? Did you think those were handed out for free ? ”
101491	101503	101523	101523	He	370	“ Are you kidding me right now ? I said stop ! ”
101504	101516	101517	101517	His	370	“ I ’ll stop when I ’m good and goddamn ready . ”
101760	101770	101771	101771	I	94	“ You can take your promotion and shove it ! ”
101888	101900	101867	101867	Cam	366	“ Joellen ! What happened ? Why ’re you back already ? ”
102002	102018	102019	102019	Cam	366	“ Easy . Take a breath , lass . Come inside and talk to me . ”
102046	102061	102036	102036	He	366	“ What happened to your hair ? And why ’ve you been cryin ’ ? ”
102062	102065	102066	102066	I	94	“ Michael , ”
102069	102078	102066	102066	I	94	“ He . . . he . . . ”
102092	102098	102083	102083	His	366	“ He what , lass ? ”
102148	102154	102141	102141	I	94	“ He ’s an asshole ! ”
102173	102190	102170	102170	He	366	“ If he got fresh with you , I ’m gon na break his bloody knees ! ”
102204	102216	102192	102192	I	94	“ Got fresh with me ? That ’s cute , grandma . ”
102217	102261	102310	102310	his	94	“ I swear to God , woman , you better tell me what he did to get you into this state or I ’m gon na assume the worst , hunt that bastard down , and divest him of his testicles . Talk . ”
102270	102308	102267	102267	I	94	“ Why is it so hard for you to wear a shirt , prancer ? This conversation would be a lot easier on me if I did n’t have to pretend you ’re not half - naked . ”
102343	102357	102329	102329	He	94	“ All these muscles are distractin ’ you again , are n’t they ? ”
102390	102393	102387	102387	he	94	“ get fresh ”
102416	102420	102412	102412	Michael	370	“ an absolute animal ”
102453	102456	102458	102458	Cam	366	“ Lass , ”
102470	102485	102458	102458	Cam	366	“ I dunno what ’s goin’ on inside that brain of yours , but — ”
102568	102573	102574	102574	he	94	“ What was that ? ”
102582	102588	102574	102574	he	94	“ That was a kiss . ”
102623	102641	102614	102614	his	94	“ You mean a revenge kiss ? Because I do n’t think that was really about me . ”
102656	102667	102614	102614	his	94	“ Just answer me this : Did he hurt you ? ”
102668	102673	102674	102674	I	94	“ Only my ego , ”
102679	102687	102674	102674	I	94	“ And maybe my faith in humanity . ”
102809	102834	102804	102804	My	94	“ Your instincts were right about him , Cam . He was at the party with his wife . I ’m such a fool . ”
102846	102853	102854	102854	he	366	“ You ’re not a fool , ”
102857	102870	102854	102854	he	366	“ Have you already forgotten what I told you before you left ? ”
102871	102886	102887	102887	Cam	366	“ No , but you ’re biased because you ’re in love with me . ”
103132	103176	103177	103177	His	366	“ I ’m gon na get you naked . Then I ’m gon na make love to you . Then you ’re gon na tell me if you want it sweet and tender again , or if you want it dirty and hard . ”
103344	103354	103355	103355	I	94	“ Forget about making love to me , Cam , ”
103366	103375	103355	103355	I	94	“ Let ’s do it dirty and hard . ”
103379	103383	103376	103376	He	366	“ Thank God , ”
103620	103637	103613	103613	My	94	“ Cam . Oh God . Do n’t stop , that ’s amazing , that ’s — ”
103895	103904	103905	103905	he	366	“ Bloody hell , that sweet fucking mouth , ”
103912	103921	103905	103905	he	366	“ I love that mouth . I love — ”
104023	104062	104012	104012	His	366	“ Wanted to do that since the second I laid eyes on you , standin ’ at my door in that ugly green sweater , tellin ’ me to turn the music down , all curves and sass . ”
104175	104184	104185	104185	He	366	“ I have to get this dress off . ”
104202	104207	104208	104208	I	94	“ Leave it on , ”
104213	104222	104208	104208	I	94	“ Just leave it on and fuck me . ”
104508	104511	104512	104512	he	366	“ Fuck , ”
104516	104526	104512	104512	he	366	“ You ’re coming . Oh fuck , Joellen — ”
104577	104586	104587	104587	He	366	“ I knew we ’d be perfect together . ”
104923	104926	104927	104927	he	366	“ Lass , ”
104930	104933	104934	104934	I	94	“ Please , ”
105091	105103	105104	105104	I	94	“ I never asked you why you and Kellen switched apartments , ”
105163	105176	105148	105148	Cam	366	“ My coach thought a change of scenery would do me good . ”
105189	105194	105177	105177	I	94	“ And did it ? ”
105204	105207	105208	105208	He	366	“ Aye . ”
105218	105222	105208	105208	He	366	“ And no . ”
105242	105253	105258	105258	Cam	366	“ What did you need a change of scenery for ? ”
105262	105272	105258	105258	Cam	366	“ My life had become . . . unmanageable . ”
105322	105329	105317	105317	I	94	“ That teenager , you mean . ”
105330	105370	105258	105258	Cam	366	“ Aye . Among other things . I was drinkin ’ way too much . Lashin ’ out at everyone . I ’ve never been great at dealin ’ constructively with my anger , even after years of therapy . ”
105371	105380	105317	105317	I	94	“ You were in therapy ? For years ? ”
105381	105475	105258	105258	Cam	366	“ I worked on my head as hard as I worked on my body . Ca n’t say the effect was as successful , but yeah . Therapy . Seein ’ how badly my mum was mind fucked by life , I ’ve always been into self - improvement . I also read a lot . Everything , really , biographies to history to politics . I did n’t go to college — gettin ’ through secondary school with a learnin ’ disability was tough enough — but I do love to read . ”
105532	105544	105510	105510	I	94	“ You do n’t seem particularly angry to me , prancer . ”
105555	105565	105545	105545	He	489	“ Beauty tames the savage beast , I suppose . ”
105622	105627	105628	105628	His	489	“ Awkward segue alert . ”
105635	105640	105628	105628	His	489	“ Okay . Go . ”
105641	105669	105628	105628	His	489	“ The lawsuit you ’re in , the one I overheard you talking with someone on the phone about . Is it related to the pregnant teenager ? ”
105673	105682	105670	105670	He	489	“ She ’s suin ’ me for paternity . ”
105693	105721	105687	105687	he	489	“ I ’m not the father , lass . I might not be a pillar of morality , but I know enough to steer clear of adolescents . ”
105722	105744	105628	105628	His	489	“ I know . I believed you before when you told me it was n’t true . How old is she ? ”
105745	105748	105687	105687	he	489	“ Sixteen . ”
105749	105759	105628	105628	His	489	“ Oh my God ! She ’s a child ! ”
105765	105801	105760	105760	His	489	“ You would n’t say that if you saw her picture . Or got a look inside her mind . She ’s a cunning little thing . Wants attention , knows how to get it . ”
105802	105831	105687	105687	he	489	“ I think you ’d better just tell me the story , because I ’m cooking up some really scary scenarios in my mind right now , Cam . ”
105844	105913	105914	105914	His	489	“ The story , to put it in a nutshell , is that I ’m a target . A big dumb bulls - eye . I ’ve done myself no favors with the way I act — drunk and disorderly , my ‘ dating ’ history , so to speak . My barrister thinks it ’s a miracle I have n’t seen more of these kinds of accusations . ”
105920	105924	105914	105914	His	489	“ Lucky me . ”
105936	105988	105933	105933	he	489	“ I had a party at my house . I was always havin’ parties . Havin’ people around makes me feel better . Less . . . antsy . My house was always filled with people . Friends — if you could call them that — teammates , strangers , whoever . ”
106057	106217	106353	106353	He	94	“ One night over the summer , this guy brings his sister . She looks twenty , at least . Full makeup , high heels , the works . The party gets wild . By three a.m. , I ’m passed out on the lawn in the backyard . When I wake up in the mornin ’ , the place is a wreck and everyone ’s gone except this girl , who I find cryin ’ in my kitchen , lookin ’ a mess . I ask her what ’s wrong , she says her brother left and she has no way home . So , idiot me , I offer to drive her . And that ’s it . That ’s all I did : drove her home . The next week I got a visit from the police , who wanted to discuss how I ’d like to plead to sexual coercion under the Sexual Offences Act . ”
106235	106246	106218	106218	I	94	“ So she claimed the two of you had sex ? ”
106247	106352	106218	106218	I	94	“ Aye . I was drunk , but I bloody well was n’t drunk enough to forget that . I never saw her after she first came in . So my legal team interviews everyone from the party , and it turns out no one can corroborate her bein ’ near me at any time . Because there was no physical evidence , either , and she had no witnesses to back up her story , the charges were n’t filed . But by then the news had picked up the story . I was called everything from a child molester to a rapist . ”
106371	106381	106353	106353	He	94	“ That kind of stink does n’t wash off . ”
106382	106391	106353	106353	He	94	“ Oh , Cam . That ’s awful . ”
106392	106419	106353	106353	He	94	“ That ’s not even the worst part . Two months later , she finds out she ’s pregnant and files a paternity suit against me . ”
106420	106439	106353	106353	He	94	“ But all it would take would be a DNA test to prove you ’re not the father ! ”
106440	106503	106353	106353	He	94	“ Aye . Which she wo n’t submit to , claiming it can hurt the unborn child . So I ’m stuck waitin ’ until she gives birth so we can get the bloody test done and prove I ’m innocent . In the meantime , she ’s all over the news , cryin ’ about how I took advantage of her . ”
106511	106522	106504	106504	I	94	“ But that ’s not fair ! She ’s lying ! ”
106530	106595	106523	106523	He	94	“ That ’s the price I have to pay for refusin ’ to settle the suit . Her barristers offered me a deal to keep her quiet , but I refused because that ’s blackmail . It ’ll all come out in the wash once the baby ’s born , but until then , it ’s a circus with me in the center ring . ”
106596	106608	106609	106609	He	94	“ But ca n’t you countersue her for defamation of character ? ”
106613	106653	106609	106609	He	94	“ If anyone ’s to blame for my character assassination , lass , it ’s me . And she ’s a child who ’s obviously messed up in the head . What good would it do in the end ? ”
106660	106681	106609	106609	He	94	“ I wish there was something I could do to help . I hate that you ’re going through this . ”
106693	106708	106682	106682	He	94	“ You ’ve already helped , lass . You have no idea how much . ”
106753	106763	106771	106771	He	94	“ This is gon na sound so fucking weird . ”
106764	106770	106709	106709	His	94	“ I ’m already worried . ”
106779	106787	106771	106771	He	94	“ You remind me of my mother . ”
106788	106828	106829	106829	He	94	“ Speaking of awkward segues ! I ’ll just be here trying not to be icked out by that , thanks . You could n’t wait to lay that gem on me until we were n’t naked in bed ? ”
106832	106845	106846	106846	He	94	“ I know . Sorry . What I mean is . . . ”
106857	106886	106846	106846	He	94	“ How you ’re a natural caretaker . How you know how to make people feel good about themselves without tryin ’ . How you ’re always honest . ”
106891	106898	106846	106846	He	94	“ How you feel like home . ”
106921	106930	106918	106918	I	94	“ You ’re killing me here , prancer . ”
106948	106961	106931	106931	He	94	“ Are we gon na talk about the elephant in the room ? ”
106998	107017	107072	107072	Cam	366	“ Do you have a name for that thing ? Because I ’ve secretly been calling it Godzilla . ”
107018	107035	107072	107072	Cam	366	“ I ’m not talkin ’ about my dick , lass , and you know it . ”
107050	107071	107036	107036	I	94	“ Have I ever mentioned that you have beautiful breasts ? Because you do . Man breasts are highly underrated . ”
107080	107092	107072	107072	Cam	366	“ I have to go back to Scotland on the third . ”
107126	107143	107123	107123	he	366	“ Trainin ’ for the new season starts on the sixth or I ’d stay longer — ”
107144	107147	107148	107148	I	94	“ No , ”
107158	107173	107148	107148	I	94	“ You ca n’t stay . You have to go back to your life . ”
107214	107219	107211	107211	Cam	366	“ Come with me . ”
107256	107263	107211	107211	Cam	366	“ standing out on a ledge . ”
107264	107311	107220	107220	My	94	“ I ’ll buy you a ticket , one with an open - ended return date so you can stay as long as you want . Take some vacation time , see if you like Scotland . . . why ’re you shakin ’ your head ? ”
107312	107319	107320	107320	I	94	“ You know it ’s impossible , ”
107363	107366	107220	107220	My	94	“ Lass — ”
107367	107468	107476	107476	Cam	366	“ I ’m thirty - six , Cam . You ’re twenty - nine . I ’ve got neuroses older than you . You ’re a glamorous , famous person whose house is always filled with people and parties , and I ’m a homebody who only socializes with my cat . You ’ll end up resenting me . I ’ll end up homesick , feeling like a burden . We both have pretty significant problems we have to fix in our lives , and using each other as crutches is n’t going to do anything but create more messes . ”
107479	107502	107476	107476	Cam	366	“ Wow . That was bloody depressin ’ . Try again . And this time keep it short and just say yes . ”
107575	107734	107548	107548	He	366	“ Number one , I do n’t give a fuck about our age difference . Neither should you . Number two , my house is always filled with people because I ’m lonely , not because I love parties . Two B , my life is n’t glamorous . Before I met you , it was a car goin’ a hundred kilometers an hour straight toward a cliff . Number three , the only thing I ’ll ever resent about you is your relentless commitment to put yourself down . I do n’t have an answer to the possibility that you might get homesick , but I bloody sure would do my best to make sure you feel as at home in my home as you do here . And number fucking four , whatever problems we have in our lives would be made significantly better by bein ’ with the only person either one of us can trust .
107735	107812	107548	107548	He	366	“ You ’re not a crutch to me , Joellen . You ’re a gift . If you do n’t want to come to Scotland because you just do n’t want to be with me , have the balls to say it , but do n’t feed me any more excuses . And stop applyin ’ your worst - case - scenario thinkin ’ to this thing between us — keep that negative bullshit in check . ”
107933	107952	107953	107953	Cam	366	“ I bet you probably only have , like , vanilla ice cream at your house , though . ”
107988	108006	107964	107964	he	366	“ Sheesh , prancer . You ’re crap with staying mad at someone , you know that ? ”
108007	108012	108013	108013	He	366	“ No , lass . ”
108056	108071	108072	108072	He	366	“ You ’re just too weird and wonderful to stay mad at for long . ”
108291	108300	108301	108301	I	94	“ I ’m not going to answer it , ”
108318	108327	108301	108301	I	94	“ What ’re you being so judgy for ? ”
108378	108407	108372	108372	his	366	“ I know you ’re in there . I do n’t care how long it takes , I ’ll be out here knockin ’ until you open up . ”
108446	108449	108512	108512	He	366	“ Joellen ! ”
108450	108458	108459	108459	I	94	“ I ’m right here , prancer , ”
108465	108473	108459	108459	I	94	“ Do n’t wake up the building . ”
108474	108478	108459	108459	I	94	“ Open up . ”
108487	108499	108479	108479	I	94	“ I ca n’t . I ’m too busy kicking myself . ”
108500	108511	108459	108459	I	94	“ Are you fucking serious ? Open the goddamn door . ”
108533	108549	108479	108479	I	94	“ I can see your head , lass . We ’ve already been over this . ”
108598	108650	108586	108586	he	366	“ Tell me I ’m wrong and you did n’t sneak out without saying good - bye after we had sex four times and some intense , soul - baring afterglow . Tell me you just came over to feed the cat and were on your way back when I knocked . ”
108661	108664	108651	108651	I	94	“ Um . ”
108675	108681	108665	108665	He	366	“ You fucking ghosted me . ”
108682	108689	108665	108665	He	366	“ No , I did n’t . ”
108690	108696	108665	108665	He	366	“ Yes , you did ! ”
108697	108730	108731	108731	I	94	“ No , ghosting is when you ’re dating someone and you break up with them and disappear from their life without any explanation . Me leaving earlier was just . . . ”
108739	108742	108731	108731	I	94	“ Expedient . ”
108756	108759	108750	108750	His	366	“ Expedient ? ”
108760	108766	108731	108731	I	94	“ Practical , I mean . ”
108798	108833	108785	108785	I	94	“ Cam . We already went over this . You ’re leaving in a few days . You live in another country . You have a life there , I have a life here . ”
108834	108837	108838	108838	he	366	“ Really ? ”
108846	108857	108838	108838	he	366	“ How ’s that life goin’ for you , Joellen ? ”
108869	108874	108859	108859	he	366	“ Ouch , prancer . ”
108875	108910	108838	108838	he	366	“ You ’re goddamn right , ouch . Now you know how I felt when I woke up alone . I ’m surprised you did n’t leave money on the dresser for services rendered . ”
108921	108942	108911	108911	I	94	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean for you to feel bad . It was just a mistake . ”
108973	108977	108954	108954	He	366	“ A mistake ? ”
108998	109013	108978	108978	I	94	“ No — Cam , listen , I did n’t mean it like that — ”
109014	109025	109026	109026	he	366	“ I know exactly how you meant it , lass , ”
109145	109148	109138	109138	I	94	“ Hello ? ”
109149	109157	109232	109232	she	1526	“ Hi , honey ! Merry Christmas ! ”
109158	109168	109138	109138	I	94	“ Hey , Mom . Merry Christmas . Eve . ”
109183	109229	109232	109232	she	1526	“ I know I ’m a day early , but we ’re going over to your sister ’s tomorrow morning and staying over . You know how crazy it gets over there with the kids . We probably wo n’t get a chance to call . ”
109409	109432	109433	109433	Cute	296	“ Oh , we got your packages in the mail yesterday , sweetie ! Thanks so much for that cute mohair scarf . ”
109478	109514	109435	109435	her	296	“ And thanks for the new Grumpy Cat calendar you sent me , Mom . Ca n’t wait to get that sucker up on the wall and spend another year staring at his constipated face . ”
109515	109530	109537	109537	she	296	“ That reminds me , honey — have you heard anything about your promotion ? ”
109609	109618	109619	109619	I	94	“ Yeah , bad news on that front , ”
109622	109724	109619	109619	I	94	“ My boss — you remember Michael , the one I told you I was in love with years ago and you said he ’d be perfect for Jacqueline?—turned out to be a major douche canoe and tried to feel me up in the ladies ’ room at the holiday party . Apparently that promotion was a kind of pay - to - play deal , and I was n’t playing . The office is closed until after New Year ’s because of the holidays , but I ’m pretty sure I ’ll be fired first thing when I go back . ”
109729	109732	109725	109726	My mother	340	“ What ? ”
109733	109799	109619	109619	I	94	“ Bummer , right ? You might want to make up the spare bedroom for me . Oh , also ? Cameron McGregor invited me to go back to Scotland with him . We ’re having some kind of confusing sexual relationship I ’m really not emotionally qualified to handle , but I knew you ’d be interested to know he ’s incredible in bed . ”
109887	109889	109891	109892	a man	373	“ ideal ”
110174	110191	110170	110170	his	366	“ I ca n’t believe you did n’t wish me a merry Christmas , you dick . ”
110192	110205	110206	110206	He	366	“ Well , we sort of were n’t talking , I thought . ”
110258	110274	110252	110252	He	366	“ Here . In case you want to make any more mistakes before I leave . ”
110351	110363	110348	110348	Cam	366	“ Okay . So . See you around . Or not . ”
110555	110561	110552	110552	I	94	“ Why are you naked ? ”
110562	110567	110523	110523	He	366	“ I sleep naked . ”
110568	110573	110552	110552	I	94	“ You were asleep ? ”
110574	110581	110523	110523	He	366	“ No . Now shut up . ”
110582	110590	110552	110552	I	94	“ Are you still mad at me ? ”
110591	110598	110523	110523	He	366	“ Yes . Now shut up . ”
110666	110675	110676	110676	he	366	“ I ’m kickin ’ you out after , ”
110697	110709	110689	110689	He	366	“ And do n’t you dare ask me any personal questions . ”
110846	110850	110842	110842	he	366	“ not yet , ”
110856	110861	110862	110862	I	94	“ Please , Cam , ”
110910	110913	110907	110907	He	366	“ Suck , ”
111128	111131	111132	111132	he	366	“ Wait , ”
111139	111144	111132	111132	he	366	“ Fuck . Wait . ”
111345	111353	111333	111333	I	94	“ I need to come , Cam . ”
111354	111358	111359	111359	He	366	“ So come . ”
111365	111370	111359	111359	He	366	“ Come with me . ”
111371	111380	111333	111333	I	94	“ Like this , or . . . ? ”
111495	111502	111491	111491	he	366	“ Is this want you wanted ? ”
111585	111591	111592	111592	he	366	“ Go ahead , luv , ”
111595	111611	111592	111592	he	366	“ Tell me it does n’t matter . Tell me it ’s all a mistake . ”
111830	111843	111844	111844	I	94	“ Well , that ’s one for the Romance Hall of Fame , ”
112235	112241	112247	112247	I	94	“ Oops , I was drunk ”
112427	112434	112441	112441	she	1570	“ Joellen , this is Portia . ”
112445	112476	112441	112441	she	1570	“ From Maddox Publishing . I wanted to wait until after Christmas to call . As you know , ah , the staff will all be returning to work tomorrow . ”
112482	112496	112441	112441	she	1570	“ Please meet us in the boardroom as soon as you come in . ”
112997	113000	112991	112991	I	94	“ Morning . ”
113207	113210	113211	113211	Portia	340	“ Joellen . ”
113222	113234	113211	113211	Portia	340	“ Thank you for coming . Please , have a seat . ”
113287	113296	113282	113282	Ruth	173	“ These gentlemen are the firm ’s attorneys . ”
113339	113400	113401	113401	My	94	“ So it ’s going to be strong - arm tactics and intimidation right off the bat , huh ? Nobody even wants to hear my side of the story ? Nobody ’s interested in what really happened — you’re just going to pin this all on me and throw me out like garbage after ten years of dedicated service ? ”
113411	113438	113401	113401	My	94	“ After I ’ve busted my ass and played by the rules and given you everything I ’ve got , I ’m the one getting punished ? ”
113492	113570	113587	113587	Ruth	173	“ I ’ve missed one day of work in the past decade . One ! And that was only because I had to get some of my lady parts chopped up and taken out , which is n’t a walk in the park , I ’ll have you know ! I cramped like a mofo and bled out clots the size of important organs for three weeks after that , sitting right out there in that chair ! ”
113591	113594	113587	113587	Ruth	173	“ Joellen . ”
113595	113616	113587	113587	Ruth	173	“ No , I ’m not finished ! I never did anything with Michael except be dazzled by all his sparkly bullshit”—I
113625	113664	113587	113587	Ruth	173	air—“gobble up all his phony - baloney lines , and share a few stupid phone conversations that lasted all of about five minutes ! I never even kissed him ! In spite of what you think you saw , Portia”—I
113679	113691	113587	113587	Ruth	173	brows—“I was trying to fight him off at the holiday party ! ”
113730	113734	113736	113736	Ruth	173	“ We know , ”
113762	113769	113755	113755	you	1599	“ Uh . . . what ? ”
113770	113792	113738	113738	I	94	“ I was in one of the stalls in the ladies ’ room that night , Joellen . I heard everything . ”
113844	113902	113840	113840	Portia	340	“ We had an emergency board meeting after Ruth disclosed what she overheard in the restroom that evening , Joellen . Obviously I ca n’t disclose the specifics of that meeting , but what I can tell you is that Michael has been removed as chief executive officer of this firm . He will not be returning . ”
113906	113919	113903	113903	I	94	“ But . . . I do n’t . . . understand . ”
113954	113974	113952	113952	brusquely	306	“ My father started this company . I ’ll be damned if my son is going to end it . ”
114067	114085	114047	114048	Sue Wong	58	“ Wait . I ’m not the first one he ’s done this to , am I ? ”
114096	114111	114092	114093	the attorneys	2502	“ Ms. Bixby , I have some documents we ’d like you to sign — ”
114112	114115	114116	114116	My	94	“ Ha ! ”
114124	114139	114116	114116	My	94	“ Yeah , I bet you do , pal ! Good luck with that ! ”
114140	114156	114158	114158	Portia	340	“ Your new position as associate editor has been approved by the board , Joellen , ”
114161	114172	114158	114158	Portia	340	“ All you have to do is sign the paperwork . ”
114186	114214	114173	114173	I	94	“ Dudes . I know I ’m not the sharpest tool in the shed , but I ’m not signing anything without having my attorney review it . ”
114234	114249	114266	114269	most of the state—“you’re	2624	“ And if you do n’t want me to sue all your asses to kingdom come”—I
114269	114283	114257	114260	everyone in the room	1606	state—“you’re going to leave me alone with Portia now so we can talk . ”
114300	114308	114310	114312	attorney number one	1608	“ Unfortunately , that ’s not possible , ”
114319	114327	114328	114328	She	340	“ Give us five minutes , gentlemen . ”
114338	114348	114328	114328	She	340	“ Ruth . We ’ll be fine . Please . ”
114405	114417	114397	114398	The woman	340	“ Why have you always been such a bitch to me ? ”
114431	114438	114428	114428	she	340	“ I was n’t expecting that . ”
114439	114473	114418	114418	She	340	“ We ’ll get to the Michael stuff in a sec . But it ’s always really bothered me that you were so mean to me . I could never figure out why . ”
114506	114521	114499	114499	she	340	“ Because you remind me so much of myself , and I hate it . ”
114531	114549	114522	114522	My	94	“ Me ? I remind you of you ? Are you nuts ? We ’re polar opposites ! ”
114561	114585	114550	114550	She	340	“ How I used to be , before I decided to stop letting life kick me in the teeth and grow some balls . ”
114595	114600	114550	114550	She	340	“ So to speak . ”
114626	114667	114616	114616	she	340	“ I always hoped one day you ’d have enough of me clapping at you and clap back . And you did , eventually . After I ’d been through the entire dictionary of names that start with the letter J. ”
114672	114683	114668	114668	I	94	“ Portia , that ’s just . . . diabolical . ”
114691	114722	114684	114684	She	340	“ I had no idea you ’d have so much patience , or I would ’ve sat you down ten years ago and told you to stop being so accommodating . ”
114727	114795	114684	114684	She	340	“ Being nice is the worst thing a woman can be . Nice means you have to swallow your own feelings and focus on everyone else ’s . Nice means you do n’t speak up when you ’re wronged . Nice means being a people pleaser and a conciliator and worrying yourself to death over others ’ opinions . Nice means never getting what you really want . ”
114796	114810	114684	114684	She	340	“ So we ’re all just supposed to walk around being giant bitches ? ”
114816	114883	114811	114811	She	340	“ That ’s one way to do it . At least you ’ll get respect . But what I really mean is that when you ’re focused on being nice , you wo n’t tell a truth that needs telling , because the worst thing a nice girl could ever do is hurt someone ’s feelings . A better thing to focus on is being real . ”
114884	114887	114888	114888	I	94	“ Real , ”
114892	114927	114964	114964	Portia	340	“ Authentic . Genuine . Live your truth . Let others live theirs . Do n’t kiss anyone ’s ass , but do n’t be an asshole , either . It ’s very simple . ”
114947	114963	114944	114944	I	94	“ That was interesting . Also weird . I ’m not sure how to respond . ”
114979	114987	114964	114964	Portia	340	“ That ’s exactly what I mean ! ”
114988	114998	114964	114964	Portia	340	“ Okay , now you ’ve totally lost me . ”
114999	115052	114964	114964	Portia	340	“ Old Joellen would ’ve found some nice , nonoffensive reply . Instead , you were real . Congratulations , there ’s hope for you yet . I was also impressed by your little speech when you came in . Very real . Strong , angry , impressive . Good for you . ”
115053	115087	114964	114964	Portia	340	“ I feel like I might be dreaming all this right now ? Like I ’m in a hospital bed somewhere , dopey on morphine and hooked up to a bunch of tubes ? ”
115112	115157	115088	115088	Portia	340	“ The associate editor position is yours if you want it . You will , however , have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and a document releasing the firm from any future claim of sexual or emotional harassment arising from this incident with Michael . ”
115166	115219	115158	115158	She	340	“ You wo n’t be able to speak about the incident in the ladies ’ room or your personal relationship with Michael , or publicly disparage Maddox Publishing in any way . If you do , you ’ll be terminated , and the firm will pursue all available legal remedies against you . ”
115223	115234	115220	115220	I	94	“ Wow . And here I thought we were bonding . ”
115241	115275	115276	115276	She	340	“ Michael wo n’t be back to the office , so you wo n’t have to deal with him again . On a personal note , I ’d like to apologize to you . ”
115284	115338	115276	115276	She	340	“ I saw this coming . There have been other incidents . It ’s one of the reasons he was removed so quickly . I ’m putting myself at legal risk by telling you that , but I think it ’s important you know that what happened is in no way your fault . ”
115356	115369	115238	115238	Portia	340	“ Thank you , Portia . That ’s very civil of you . ”
115384	115493	115380	115380	I	94	“ Okay , I ’m going to be real now . This has been a lot to digest . I spent the last ten days thinking I was out of a job , and now I ’ve got the promotion I always wanted . I ’ve spent the last ten years thinking I was in love with a guy who , it turns out , is a prick . I ’ve spent the last month living across the hall from a man who dresses like he ’s auditioning for the circus , has an ego the size of the earth ’s atmosphere , and screws like a champ . ”
115502	115516	115494	115494	I	94	“ Sorry , that last part was probably a little too much reality . ”
115522	115532	115517	115517	Her	1615	“ Do go on . I ’m enjoying this . ”
115533	115554	115517	115517	Her	1615	“ I ’m sure you do n’t want to hear about , you know , the sex stuff , though . ”
115560	115597	115555	115555	She	1615	“ Why ever not ? I assume you ’re talking about the big rugged thing who strutted around like a rooster and had all the girls in an estrogen frenzy ? He was quite the stud . ”
115598	115607	115685	115685	She	1615	“ Well , yeah , but . . . ”
115625	115640	115618	115618	She	1615	“ I mean , it ’s not like that ’s your cup of tea . ”
115649	115677	115644	115644	her	1615	“ I might seem cold to you , Joellen , but I can assure you , a man like that is every woman ’s cup of tea . ”
115678	115684	115685	115685	She	1615	“ Even a lesbian ’s ? ”
115698	115725	115685	115685	She	1615	“ It ’s quite ignorant to assume a strong , no - nonsense , unmarried woman must be a lesbian . That ’s really antiquated thinking . ”
115726	115757	115685	115685	She	1615	“ No , I do n’t think that — Michael told me you were gay . He said your girlfriend was on the board of some charity with his wife . ”
115767	115836	115685	115685	She	1615	“ Michael told you I was gay ? Oh , that ’s funny . No , Joellen , I ’m not a lesbian . I just was n’t interested in Michael , which was a novel experience for him . He ’s a petty little liar . It just goes to show how small he is that he thinks calling me a lesbian is getting revenge . Idiot . ”
115856	115868	115846	115846	I	94	“ He was n’t even really getting divorced , was he ? ”
115869	115905	115910	115910	she	1617	“ No . He ’ll never divorce that dimwitted wife of his . She lets him do whatever he wants . Although now that he ’s out of a job , she might divorce him . ”
115913	115957	115910	115910	she	1617	“ Just sign the papers and put this behind you , Joellen . You deserve the promotion . You ’ve worked hard . Do n’t let this opportunity pass by because of the way it came about . That would be a mistake . ”
116013	116017	116010	116010	I	94	“ Oh shit . ”
116018	116023	116010	116010	I	94	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
116094	116113	116114	116114	She	340	“ Portia , you ’ll have to excuse me . I ’ve got to go home and pack . ”
116120	116134	116114	116114	She	340	“ Pack ? What are you talking about ? Where are you going ? ”
116148	116151	116135	116135	I	94	“ Scotland ! ”
116390	116393	116385	116385	We	1632	“ Oof ! ”
116444	116477	116436	116436	I	94	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle I ’m so sorry I hope you ’re not hurt I have to go pack I ’m leaving right now for Scotland I ’m not letting Cam get away ! ”
116637	116644	116633	116634	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Ducky ? Yoo - hoo ! ”
116645	116691	116633	116634	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ I ca n’t talk right now Mrs. Dinwiddle I ’m having a mental breakdown and I have to be at the airport in like ten seconds Cam ’s flight is leaving can you please pick up my mail for me while I ’m gone ? ”
116747	116757	116736	116737	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ So he finally convinced you , did he ? ”
116773	116780	116763	116763	her	1817	“ Convinced me to do what ? ”
116781	116788	116736	116737	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Fall in love with him . ”
116801	116846	116796	116796	she	1817	“ What on earth did you think he was doing all this time , Ducky ? Going around without shirts and offering to teach you how to kiss and having you make him dinner so he had an excuse to spend time with you ? ”
116862	116872	116873	116873	she	1817	“ Oh yes , I know all about it , ”
116879	116904	116873	116873	she	1817	“ He was smitten with you from the first . It was so romantic , I just had to help him , my dear ! ”
116905	116908	116909	116909	I	94	“ Help ? ”
116916	116919	116920	116920	she	1817	“ Well , ”
116924	116935	116920	116920	she	1817	“ you really are quite hopeless with men , Ducky . ”
116967	116974	116975	116976	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Oh ! Before I forget . ”
117012	117017	117000	117000	I	94	“ What is that ? ”
117018	117023	117056	117056	she	1817	“ Your Christmas gift . ”
117024	117040	117000	117000	I	94	“ Oh , that ’s so sweet , Mrs. Dinwiddle . You should n’t have . ”
117041	117049	117056	117056	she	1817	“ I did n’t , my dear . ”
117076	117095	117056	117056	she	1817	“ It ’s from Cameron . He gave it to me before he left to give to you . ”
117153	117166	117167	117168	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ The exact color of your eyes , he said they were . ”
117178	117191	117167	117168	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ He bought them the same day you bought your party dress . ”
117192	117196	117197	117197	I	94	“ The manager , ”
117206	117243	117197	117197	I	94	“ He asked to speak to the manager . I thought he was going to complain about the paparazzi who took our picture , but he . . . bought . . . these . . . ”
117297	117303	117294	117295	Mrs. Dinwiddle	1817	“ Can you hear that ? ”
117308	117324	117304	117304	She	1817	“ I ’m not deaf , my dear ! Of course I can hear it ! ”
117536	117544	117533	117533	He	366	“ Can I help you , lass ? ”
117669	117685	117666	117666	I	94	“ I was just wondering what the difference is between a kilt and a skirt . ”
117712	117727	117709	117709	he	373	“ What you wear underneath . Ask me what I ’m wearin ’ underneath . ”
117747	117764	117728	117728	I	94	“ I feel like this is a trick to get me to look at your junk . ”
117765	117768	117770	117770	Cam	366	“ Aye , ”
117780	117784	117772	117772	He	366	“ It is . ”
117851	117865	117847	117847	He	366	“ You ’re supposed to be on a flight to Scotland , prancer . ”
117866	117880	117881	117881	He	366	“ We ’re supposed to be on a flight to Scotland , lass . ”
117919	117986	117912	117912	I	94	“ I was just packing , I was coming to meet you , I went into work and realized I ’m an idiot and I did n’t want to be without you , so I rushed home and then Mrs. Dinwiddle told me everything — you’re in cahoots with Mrs. Dinwiddle!—but I was rushing to pack and then I heard your stupid music , and oh — ”
118027	118049	118024	118024	he	1655	“ I told my coach I needed another week to get the woman I love to fall in love with me . ”
118050	118053	118054	118057	The woman I love	51	“ Oh . ”
118073	118079	118059	118059	I	94	“ What did he say ? ”
118080	118103	118104	118104	He	1655	“ That I was a bloody idiot and if I was n’t back in two days , I was off the team . ”
118132	118135	118138	118138	him	366	“ Wait ! ”
118151	118167	118141	118141	We	1658	“ I got the promotion . They fired Michael . Portia is n’t a lesbian . ”
118173	118199	118168	118168	He	366	“ Never mind . Listen — I have a very serious question to ask you . Our entire relationship could hinge on how you answer . ”
118204	118213	118168	118168	He	366	“ So no pressure , then . Shoot . ”
118226	118239	118222	118222	I	94	“ What flavors of ice cream do you have at your house ? ”
118276	118285	118286	118286	he	366	“ I have all the flavors , lass , ”
118291	118311	118286	118286	he	366	“ This is Cameron McGregor we ’re talkin ’ about . I ’ve got every goddamn flavor you need . ”
118335	118344	118345	118345	I	94	“ We ’re going to miss the flight , ”
118358	118364	118365	118365	His	366	“ What about your job ? ”
118381	118399	118401	118401	he	366	“ I ’m in a good bargaining position to get them to let me work from home . ”
118419	118441	118414	118414	I	94	“ I ’ll tell you about it later . Now are we going to try to catch this flight or what ? ”
118450	118473	118442	118442	His	366	“ No , lass . We ’ll get the next one . We ’ve got more important things to do right now . ”
118807	118817	118767	118768	Cameron McGregor	366	“ What ’re you up to , Miss Snufflebottom ? ”
118894	118912	118883	118883	me	94	“ Making a list . Though I was about to start on your Valentine ’s Day present . ”
118913	118916	118917	118917	He	366	“ Oh ? ”
118992	119005	118977	118977	he	366	“ Does this present include a striptease and strategically placed whipped cream ? ”
119059	119084	119045	119045	Cam	366	“ It might . Depends on how soon you say you ’ll take me to see Nanny O’Shea again . I adore that woman . ”
119089	119096	119085	119085	Cam	366	“ As soon as you want . ”
119217	119223	119206	119206	He	366	“ Mornin ’ , sweetheart . ”
119278	119286	119287	119287	I	94	“ Good morning to you , prancer , ”
119295	119317	119287	119287	I	94	“ Though it ’s not morning anymore — it ’s afternoon . I ca n’t believe we stayed up until four a.m. ”
119318	119335	119375	119375	he	366	“ You ’re the one who had to watch just one more episode of Peaky Blinders . ”
119336	119349	119287	119287	I	94	“ Sorry . Netflix is my Kryptonite . How ’d you sleep ? ”
119378	119387	119375	119375	he	366	“ Best night ’s sleep of my life . ”
119397	119409	119388	119388	I	94	“ You ’ve said that every morning since I got here . ”
119410	119422	119423	119423	He	366	“ That ’s because every mornin ’ it ’s been true . ”
119444	119452	119435	119435	he	366	“ What ’s that big grin for ? ”
119453	119473	119474	119474	He	366	“ For the most beautiful man in the world , with a heart almost as big as his ego . ”
119492	119508	119509	119509	He	366	“ I ’ve got things bigger than my heart or my ego , darlin ’ . ”
119526	119535	119568	119568	Cam	366	“ I see Godzilla ’s awake , too . ”
119536	119545	119568	119568	Cam	366	“ Indeed he is . Awake and hungry . ”
119546	119561	119568	119568	Cam	366	“ When is n’t he awake and hungry ? That thing is on steroids ! ”
119562	119567	119568	119568	Cam	366	“ ‘ Thing ’ ? ”
119578	119598	119573	119573	I	94	“ Oh , excuse me . I forgot I ’m supposed to pay the family jewels their proper respect . ”
119608	119629	119599	119599	Cam	366	“ And most of the time , woman , you do a hoora good job at showin ’ your respect . ”
119639	119651	119633	119633	my	94	“ Most of the time ? What exactly are you implying ? ”
119666	119675	119652	119652	He	366	“ Now who ’s got the big ego ? ”
119676	119684	119685	119685	I	94	“ You ’re rubbing off on me , ”
119696	119708	119709	119709	he	366	“ Oh , I ’ll rub off on you all right , ”
119753	119766	119767	119767	I	94	“ I ’ve got a conference call in less than ten minutes . ”
119866	119869	119874	119874	He	366	“ Cam . ”
119870	119873	119881	119881	he	366	“ Mmm . ”
119885	119894	119881	119881	he	366	“ I have a call with work in — ”
119895	119901	119902	119902	he	366	“ I ’ll be quick , ”
119948	119955	119956	119956	I	94	“ Let ’s wait until after , ”
119964	119991	119956	119956	I	94	“ I do n’t want to be quick this morning . I want to go slow . Long and slow and deep and hard and oh — ”
120026	120034	120023	120023	Cam	366	“ Bloody hell . She ’s early . ”
120048	120057	120043	120043	he	366	“ Sweetie . I have to get that . ”
120100	120118	120119	120119	He	366	“ You ’d give Mrs. Dinwiddle a run for her money in the theatrics department , honey . ”
120210	120215	120231	120231	Her	1681	“ Joellen Bixby speaking . ”
120216	120230	120231	120231	Her	1681	“ Happy Monday , Joellen . It ’s Portia . How are you ? ”
120339	120354	120545	120545	Portia	340	“ I ’m great , Portia . How ’s everything at the home office ? ”
120355	120377	120395	120395	Portia	340	“ Nothing interesting to report since we last spoke , except Denny has launched into some new seasonally themed fart jokes . ”
120378	120394	120545	120545	Portia	340	“ Oh God . Valentine ’s Day fart jokes ? I ca n’t even imagine . ”
120398	120409	120395	120395	Portia	340	“ Yes . Apparently farts are the screams of trapped — ”
120410	120413	120414	120414	I	94	“ Stop ! ”
120426	120449	120414	120414	I	94	“ I left the country to escape fart jokes — I do n’t need you telling them to me over the phone ! ”
120450	120475	120395	120395	Portia	340	“ I know for a fact you left the country for a different reason altogether , Joellen . And how is your Scottish baller ? ”
120490	120523	120476	120476	I	94	“ Do n’t let Ruth in HR hear you talking like that or you ’ll get a black mark on your employment record . And he ’s great , thanks for asking . ”
120539	120544	120476	120476	I	94	“ He ’s amazing . ”
120549	120583	120545	120545	Portia	340	“ If you ’re about to tell me you need time off for a honeymoon , I ’m about to tell you there are very few places on earth without Wi - Fi — ”
120584	120599	120545	120545	Portia	340	“ Nobody ’s getting married ! We ’re not even talking about that yet ! ”
120617	120640	120610	120610	Portia	340	“ Forgive the impropriety , but you ’re almost forty . You ’ve probably got about half a dozen good eggs left . ”
120641	120661	120545	120545	Portia	340	“ Whoa ! We went from getting married straight to infertility ! Have you been talking to my mother ? ”
120662	120665	120666	120666	she	340	“ No , ”
120669	120714	120666	120666	she	340	“ but I think you ’d be a wonderful mother . No time like the present . So how ’s Beth Addison ’s book coming along ? I ca n’t wait to get that sucker to market . She ’s such a fantastic writer . ”
120715	120725	120545	120545	Portia	340	“ You ’re giving me whiplash here , Portia . ”
120726	120754	120755	120755	She	340	“ Keep up , Joellen . Just because you ’re not in Manhattan any longer does n’t mean I ’ll accept any slack in your mental pace . ”
120758	120769	120755	120755	She	340	“ Or has all the haggis gone to your head ? ”
120815	120845	120788	120788	He	366	“ I would n’t eat haggis if you paid me a billion dollars . Let ’s get back to Beth Addison before this conversation completely goes off the rails . ”
120856	120876	120877	120877	He	366	“ We should talk about marriage , though . Considerin ’ I already talked to your parents about it . ”
120936	120947	120929	120929	I	94	“ . . . on track with the dev edit ? ”
120948	120958	120959	120959	I	94	“ What ? Huh ? What ’d you say ? ”
120993	121013	120987	120987	Portia	340	“ I ’m glad I did n’t already patch the rest of the team in — you’re hopeless today . ”
121014	121048	121052	121052	her	340	“ Portia , I ’m so sorry — can I call you back in five minutes ? I ’m having trouble with the connection . I ’m going to get on a landline . ”
121093	121115	121087	121087	he	366	“ Oh , no . She ’s thinkin ’ . I can smell the smoke from all the way over here . ”
121124	121134	121121	121121	I	94	“ You talked to my parents about marrying me ? ”
121135	121139	121140	121140	he	366	“ I know , ”
121146	121222	121140	121140	he	366	“ It ’s a little ridiculous considerin ’ your advanced age , but I when we tell our kids the story about how we fell in love , got married , and lived happily ever after , I wanna be able to say I asked your father for permission . Even though I really just told him I ’d be marryin ’ his daughter , not asked , but that can be our little secret . ”
121256	121272	121248	121248	I	94	“ But I ’ve . . . I ’ve only been here for six weeks . ”
121290	121312	121283	121283	he	1691	“ Yep . And how many times during those six weeks have you told me how much you love it here ? ”
121348	121416	121417	121417	He	1691	“ You love my flat . You love the city . You love workin ’ from home . You love Nanny O’Shea . You love the food — except for haggis — and the people , and the weather , and my mates on the Devils , and sittin ’ in the stands , watchin ’ me play . You love that Mr. Bingley has a girlfriend . ”
121500	121504	121505	121505	he	1691	“ In fact , ”
121518	121537	121505	121505	he	1691	“ I think the only thing you have n’t yet said you love . . . is me . ”
121614	121623	121599	121599	Me	94	“ I . . . I . . . ”
121637	121653	121629	121629	He	366	“ Sorry , what was that ? Were you trying to say somethin’ , lass ? ”
121729	121733	121734	121734	he	366	“ Go ahead , ”
121737	121814	121734	121734	he	366	“ Tell me how you were in love with me from the start , only you mistook that funny feelin ’ in your stomach for gas . Tell me how I knocked you off your feet from the first moment I opened my mouth and you heard my incredibly sexy voice . Tell me how no other man on earth looks as good in a kilt as I do or makes you laugh like I do . ”
121819	121836	121734	121734	he	366	“ Or makes you scream like I do . Go on , lass . Tell me . ”
121855	121858	121859	121859	I	94	“ Yes , ”
121868	121874	121859	121859	I	94	“ Yes to all that . ”
121912	121922	121901	121901	he	366	“ Now tell me how happy I make you . ”
121923	121932	121933	121933	He	366	“ Stupidly happy . Amazingly happy . Yes . ”
121944	121960	121961	121961	He	366	“ And how you want to spend the rest of your life just like this . ”
121970	121975	121961	121961	He	366	“ In my arms . ”
121991	121994	121988	121988	I	94	“ Yes . ”
122020	122044	122017	122017	he	366	“ Now tell me you love me , lass . And make it good , ’cause you ’ve made me wait too long . ”
122060	122155	122045	122045	I	94	“ I love you the way I love the smell of old books . I love you the way I love a hot bath on a cold day . I love you the way I love sonnets and ice cream and a swimsuit that does n’t make me look like I ’m made of burrata . I love you the way I love the sun on my face in winter . The way I love a favorite song playing on the radio when I ’m driving home from the beach on a summer day . ”
122187	122239	122184	122184	I	94	“ I love you like I love starry nights , and really crunchy pickles , and discovering an amazing new author , and Sunday mornings in bed with the paper and chocolate croissants . Like I love the way the air smells after it rains . Like I love to laugh . ”
122269	122335	122344	122344	He	366	“ But actually I love you more than all those things combined , Cameron McGregor . I love you like I never knew I could love anything . You ’re more important to me than air itself , and I do n’t ever want to spend a day without you . Because you believed in me , this little ugly duckling finally became a swan . ”
122362	122373	122374	122374	he	366	“ You were always a swan , you bloody idiot , ”
122411	122435	122397	122397	They	2095	“ Whatever I am , prancer , I ’m yours . Now kiss me before you say something stupid and ruin the moment . ”
122436	122443	122444	122444	he	366	“ God , you ’re bossy , ”
122482	122485	122472	122472	He	366	“ Wait . ”
122491	122494	122486	122486	I	94	“ What ? ”
122495	122505	122537	122537	he	366	“ You have n’t said you ’ll marry me . ”
122506	122518	122486	122486	I	94	“ Well . . . technically , you have n’t asked . ”
122526	122535	122519	122519	He	366	“ You ’re right . I have n’t . ”
122547	122550	122544	122544	I	94	“ So ? ”
122551	122567	122537	122537	he	366	“ So I think I should wait until after lunch . I ’m pretty hungry . ”
122568	122571	122574	122574	I	94	“ Cam ! ”
122597	122620	122579	122579	He	366	“ All right , hold your horses , Miss Snufflebottom , gimme a minute to compose myself before I pop the question ! ”
122656	122663	122653	122653	He	366	“ We ’re gettin ’ married . ”
122664	122673	122653	122653	He	366	“ Ugh ! That was n’t a question ! ”
122684	122690	122674	122674	He	366	“ Are we getting married ? ”
122742	122760	122761	122761	I	94	“ Fine . I can see I ’m going to have to take control of this situation . ”
