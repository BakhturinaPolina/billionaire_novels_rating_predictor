170	174	161	161	I	329	“ Thank you . ”
189	209	179	179	he	418	“ Would it be very wrong if I got an erection ? Things are getting a bit heavy downstairs . ”
215	225	212	212	I	329	“ You always were a slut for French lace . ”
239	253	226	226	He	418	“ Twirl , darling . We need to see this dress in action . ”

331	344	323	323	I	329	“ Oh my God . You ’re one month older than me . ”
345	351	352	352	Hands	53	“ I ’m being metaphorical ! ”
386	403	381	381	he	418	“ Now , I admit I did n’t always have faith that Brad would marry you — ”
404	423	467	467	He	418	“ You literally told me , and I quote , ‘ That shitstick will never marry you . ’ ”
427	466	424	424	He	418	“ Mary Poppins , you ’ve got a memory like an elephant ! As I was saying , I did n’t always have faith , but I ’m so happy to be proven wrong . For your sake . ”
517	550	509	509	his	418	“ But if he does a single thing that makes you unhappy , if he so much as makes you frown , I ’ll neuter that shitstick with a rusty butter knife . ”
565	572	561	561	I	329	“ I love you , too . ”
573	579	621	621	He	418	“ You ’re disgustingly sentimental . ”
594	620	580	580	He	418	“ I ’m gon na throw that right back at you when you ’re weeping into your hankie as I take my vows , girlfriend . ”
642	649	631	631	he	418	“ Any last - minute jitters ? ”
650	653	621	621	He	418	“ No . ”
749	781	746	746	Jenner	418	“ I ’ve got the Jag right outside , you know . We could be in wine country getting massages and ogling the pool boys at Meadowood in under two hours . ”
787	823	782	782	I	329	“ I know Brad ’s not your favorite person , but if you ruin my wedding day by talking shit about my husband , I ’ll light your collection of vintage Gucci scarves on fire . ”
833	851	824	824	He	418	“ Do n’t get your knickers in a twist , Bridezilla . My lips are henceforth sealed . ”
867	886	852	852	He	418	“ But I want to be on the record as saying that you could do so much better — ”
887	890	932	932	He	418	“ Jenner ! ”
904	909	910	910	he	418	“ You ’re right , ”

1151	1179	1139	1139	He	418	“ Do n’t worry , darling , I ’ll slouch and pout as we go down the aisle so you ’ll look even more glorious in comparison . ”
1184	1226	1180	1180	I	329	“ Yeah , except slouching and pouting make you look prettier , not worse . I ca n’t believe I was dumb enough to ask a model to be my maid of honor . I rue the day I met you . ”
1227	1281	1180	1180	I	329	“ You ’re lucky you met me . If I had n’t pretended to be your boyfriend to save you from that Neanderthal slobbering all over you in the shoe department at Neiman ’s ten years ago , you might still be there , trying to politely avoid his big , hairy hands . ”
1282	1292	1180	1180	I	329	“ Be quiet and give me the damn bouquet . ”
1314	1327	1310	1310	he	315	“ Calla lilies ? Good God . They ’re a funeral flower . ”
1331	1351	1328	1328	I	329	“ If you say anything even remotely close to How apropos , I ’ll gut you like a fish . ”
1367	1398	1352	1352	He	315	“ Ah , more threats of violence . On the wedding day , no less . How very Don Corleone of you . Must be that Italian blood of yours . ”
1399	1415	1416	1416	I	329	“ You ’re damn straight . Now let ’s go make that aisle our bitch . ”
1426	1429	1416	1416	I	329	“ Girls ! ”
1486	1496	1498	1498	Jenner	418	“ You should ’ve installed scaffolding for those things , ”
1518	1539	1507	1507	Danielle	1931	“ She tried , but the girls need to be free . I made her take all the boning out . ”
1544	1553	1540	1540	Jenner	418	“ Is this a wedding or a cabaret ? ”
1554	1567	1569	1569	Ginny	60	“ It ’s not only a wedding — it ’s the wedding , ”
1602	1625	1569	1569	Ginny	60	“ Everyone who ’s anyone in San Francisco is here . I ca n’t wait to see the coverage in the press ! ”
1629	1640	1626	1626	I	329	“ The press . God , do n’t remind me . ”
1641	1678	1679	1679	Ginny	60	“ I know those jerks from the tabloids have been following you around , but the people Daddy hired to cover the wedding are totally legit . It ’ll be great for your company , Kimber . ”
1690	1718	1679	1679	Ginny	60	“ These dresses are gorgeous , and you look like a princess . Once the pictures come out , your obscure little dress shop will be famous . ”
1719	1723	1679	1679	Ginny	60	“ Knock wood . ”
1724	1733	1737	1737	Miranda	57	“ Please ! Everyone , let ’s move ! ”
1818	1825	1809	1809	I	329	“ It ’s showtime , darling , ”
1837	1847	1809	1809	I	329	“ Chin up . Back straight . Tits out . ”
1891	1895	1889	1889	Pachelbel	66	“ Canon in D ”
2087	2092	2081	2081	Jenner	418	“ Steady , darling . ”
2193	2206	2189	2189	Jenner	418	“ Your spoiled little frat boy looks even more douchey than usual . ”
2247	2262	2236	2236	I	329	“ He looks like he ’s facing a firing squad . Is that normal ? ”
2263	2293	2297	2297	Jenner	418	“ Maybe Satan got a drop of holy water on his skin , and he ’s trying not to turn to ash in front of all Daddy ’s constituents . ”
2384	2396	2377	2377	I	329	“ Who gives this woman to be married to this man ? ”
2397	2402	2404	2404	Jenner	418	“ She gives herself , ”
2443	2450	2440	2440	I	329	“ Honey ? Are you okay ? ”
2613	2664	2600	2601	The priest	331	“ Bradley Hamilton Wingate , do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife ? To have and to hold from this day forward , for better , for worse , for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health , until death do you part ? ”
2720	2723	2714	2715	the priest	331	“ Son ? ”
2803	2806	2792	2793	Senator Wingate	70	“ Bradley ! ”
2822	2831	2818	2818	he	331	“ I . . . I . . . ”
2852	2857	2858	2858	He	331	“ Yes , honey ? ”
2884	2906	2907	2907	He	331	“ I ca n’t do it I just ca n’t I ’m sorry this is n’t happening , Dad . . . ”
2921	2936	2907	2907	He	331	“ I ca n’t do it there ’s no way I can marry her ! ”
3023	3031	3015	3016	Someone snickers	346	“ So much for Brad ’s inheritance . ”
3133	3142	3144	3144	Jenner	418	“ Well , look on the bright side , ”
3166	3178	3150	3150	he	346	“ That nose of Satan ’s will never be straight again . ”
3225	3228	3229	3229	I	329	“ Yeah , ”
3233	3243	3229	3229	I	329	“ His nose , my heart . Same mush . ”
3493	3498	3635	3635	I	329	“ The Jilted Dressmaker ! ”
3517	3538	3635	3635	I	329	“ Danielle texted me that she made it home safe . She wanted to know how you were holding up . ”
3539	3546	3635	3635	I	329	“ What ’d you tell her ? ”
3547	3581	3582	3582	He	360	“ I lied and said you were doing fine . I knew if I did n’t , she and those boobs of hers would turn around and get right back on a plane . ”
3588	3613	3582	3582	He	360	“ How anyone could move to Cleveland after growing up in San Fran is beyond me . Ohio is the Florida of the Midwest . ”
3614	3621	3582	3582	He	360	“ You ’re a terrible snob . ”
3622	3634	3582	3582	He	360	“ Merci . When are you going to call your father ? ”
3685	3707	3674	3674	My	329	“ He thinks I ’m on my honeymoon . I ’ve got another eleven days before I have to call him . ”
3708	3716	3674	3674	My	329	“ Unless he sees the pictures online . ”
3792	3823	3877	3878	Lucky bitch	363	“ Tell me again why we did n’t go on your honeymoon like the girls did in Sex and the City after Carrie got dumped by Big at the altar ? ”
3824	3876	3877	3878	Lucky bitch	363	“ Because two weeks at a dude ranch in Montana was Brad ’s idea of bliss , not mine . And you know very well Carrie did n’t get dumped at the altar . She got dumped over the phone at the church before she had to walk down the aisle . ”
3886	3917	3883	3883	Jenner	418	“ Au contraire . Two weeks at a dude ranch sounds like absolute heaven , darling . Just think — all those cowboys . And their lassos . Oh my . ”
3937	3970	3925	3925	he	363	“ No . No cowboys . No boys of any kind , for that matter . I do n’t care if I never see another man for the rest of my life ! ”
3979	3994	3971	3971	Jenner	418	“ You do realize I ’m the proud owner of a penis , yes ? ”
3995	4001	3971	3971	Jenner	418	“ You do n’t count . ”
4002	4005	3971	3971	Jenner	418	“ Ouch ! ”
4006	4013	4014	4014	I	329	“ You know what I mean ! ”
4069	4077	4066	4066	I	329	“ Do you think it ’s Brad ? ”
4084	4113	4081	4081	Jenner	418	“ I rather doubt it , darling , since he has a key . He ’s probably still picking bits of cartilage out of his teeth , anyway . ”
4128	4137	4119	4119	Jenner	418	“ Do you want me to get it ? ”
4138	4149	4081	4081	Jenner	418	“ Why are they knocking and not ringing the bell ? ”
4184	4199	4119	4119	Jenner	418	“ I ’ll just go look through the peephole and see who it is . ”
4224	4237	4217	4217	his	418	“ It appears to be a courier . Should I open up ? ”
4336	4360	4333	4333	I	329	“ Do you think it ’s a trap ? Like is that really a guy from TMZ and that clipboard is a camera ? ”
4361	4366	4368	4368	Jenner	418	“ Oh , yes , ”
4375	4391	4368	4368	Jenner	418	“ The infamous clipboard camera . I hear they ’re all the rage these days . ”
4392	4434	4333	4333	I	329	“ What about the guy yesterday who knocked on the door and said he was from the electric company but turned out to be a journalist from The Examiner wanting to know if the reports that I was suicidal were true ? ”
4440	4446	4435	4435	Jenner	418	“ You have a point . ”
4447	4453	4454	4454	Jenner	418	“ I know I do ! ”
4457	4484	4485	4485	He	418	“ If this is a man trying to take your picture to sell to the tabloids , I ’ll divest him of his testicles . Happy ? ”
4498	4507	4485	4485	He	418	“ Hello . How may I help you ? ”
4508	4516	4517	4518	The courier	372	“ Got a package for Miss DiSanto . ”
4525	4529	4517	4518	The courier	372	“ That you ? ”
4591	4601	4603	4603	Jenner	418	“ Although that has a lovely ring to it , ”
4605	4625	4626	4626	He	418	“ I ’m sorry to have to tell you that I ’m not , in fact , Miss DiSanto . ”
4631	4639	4640	4640	He	418	“ Here is the lady in question . ”
4643	4656	4640	4640	He	418	“ And I ’m using the term lady loosely , mind you . ”
4679	4685	4670	4670	he	418	“ Sign on number twelve . ”
4749	4765	4746	4746	Jenner	418	“ Ooh . Fancy . Do you think it ’s an invitation to a ball ? ”
4766	4769	4770	4770	I	329	“ Ha . ”
4790	4809	4770	4770	I	329	“ I have been unable to reach you . Come at once . Your father is gravely ill . ”
5187	5234	5181	5182	a member	392	“ Thank you for joining us , Mrs. Wingate . All food and beverages in the lounge are complimentary . You ’re welcome to take advantage of the massage and facial services offered in the private spa room near the back . Those are also complimentary . ”
5365	5370	5355	5357	A smiling waitress	397	“ Champagne , ma’am ? ”
5371	5377	5378	5378	I	329	“ Yes , thank you . ”
6211	6220	6207	6208	a man	428	“ Che bella . You ’re very talented . ”
6291	6295	6287	6287	I	329	“ Thank you , ”
6328	6334	6287	6287	I	329	“ Are you an artist ? ”
6335	6338	6308	6308	you	329	“ No . ”
6339	6342	6287	6287	I	329	“ Hmm . ”
6425	6436	6437	6437	He	428	“ It needs ruching in the small of the back . ”
6454	6457	6437	6437	He	428	“ Here . ”
6601	6607	6614	6616	The Italian stallion	431	“ I ’ve offended you . ”
6673	6676	6670	6670	He	431	“ How ? ”
6713	6720	6699	6699	he	431	“ How have I offended you ? ”
6769	6776	6766	6766	I	329	“ I do n’t speak English , ”
6786	6789	6790	6790	he	434	“ Really ? ”
6793	6811	6790	6790	he	434	“ Odd — you seemed to understand me a few moments ago . Let me try again . ”
6870	6880	6857	6857	I	329	“ I do n’t want to talk to you . ”
6887	6895	6881	6881	He	434	“ Ah . You are a lesbian . ”
6896	6920	6881	6881	He	434	“ No , Count Egotistico , I ’m not a lesbian ! I ’m just not in the mood for conversation , okay ? ”
6921	6924	6925	6925	His	434	“ Okay . ”
6939	6948	6925	6925	His	434	“ What are you in the mood for ? ”
7055	7083	7049	7049	I	329	“ You arrogant , stuck - up , cocky , self - important , sexist peacock . You wanna know what I ’m in the mood for ? ”
7090	7093	7084	7084	I	329	“ Murder . ”
7155	7166	7151	7151	he	434	“ Yes , bella . I want you , too . ”
7207	7214	7215	7215	My	329	“ Oh , I get it . ”
7225	7235	7215	7215	My	329	“ You ’re hilarious , pal . Very funny . ”
7244	7265	7236	7236	I	329	“ Where ’s the camera hidden ? In there ? Or is it one of the buttons on your jacket ? ”
7282	7287	7266	7266	I	329	“ Go fuck yourself . ”
7342	7356	7336	7336	I	329	“ Off with you . I do n’t have time for this shit . ”
7357	7369	7336	7336	I	329	“ Which shit is that ? Being desired by a man ? ”
7382	7488	7376	7376	I	329	“ Look . You ’ve had your fun . You ’ve got your pictures , or your video , now you can go back to whatever rock you crawled out from under and post all that crap online so everyone can laugh at me some more . And just for the record , I ca n’t believe you ’d stoop so low as to find out my itinerary and stalk me all the way to New York . I swear to God , if any of your buddies are waiting for me when I get off my next flight , I ’ll cut a bitch . ”
7497	7528	7489	7489	He	440	“ Oh , you ’re going with the silent treatment ? The last guy who did that to me ended up with a broken nose . You ’ve been warned . ”
7580	7586	7572	7572	I	329	“ He ’s a paparazzi , ”
7601	7608	7597	7597	He	440	“ The word paparazzi is plural . ”
7625	7632	7609	7609	I	329	“ So is the word fists . ”
7647	7663	7641	7641	he	440	“ I ’ll take another Glenlivet , please . The lady will have another champagne . ”
7714	7717	7718	7718	I	329	“ Wait . ”
7723	7735	7718	7718	I	329	“ You ’re probably not even really Italian , are you ? ”
7755	7778	7749	7749	he	440	“ That ’s not proof of anything . If I started speaking Mandarin right now , it would n’t make me Chinese . ”
7785	7790	7779	7779	He	440	“ You speak Mandarin ? ”
7791	7798	7749	7749	he	440	“ That ’s not my point . ”
7799	7810	7779	7779	He	440	“ So you ’d like some other kind of proof ? ”
7823	7840	7811	7811	I	329	“ Short of a DNA test , there ’s nothing that can prove you ’re Italian . ”
7841	7847	7749	7749	he	440	“ Of course there is . ”
7855	7873	7852	7852	I	329	“ Okay . I ’ll play your silly little game . What would prove you ’re Italian ? ”
7886	7897	7874	7874	His	440	“ Have you ever made love with an Italian man ? ”
7905	7913	7898	7898	I	329	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake . ”
7924	7927	7914	7914	He	440	“ Exactly . ”
7976	7979	7981	7982	Euro Hunk	434	“ So , ”
7989	7998	7981	7982	Euro Hunk	434	“ You ’re being followed by the paparazzi . ”
8007	8019	8002	8003	This guy	418	“ Let ’s just call them what they are : scum . ”
8051	8058	8020	8020	He	418	“ Even scum has its uses . ”
8064	8074	8059	8059	I	329	“ God , how do you sleep at night ? ”
8075	8083	8059	8059	I	329	“ Like a baby , thank you . ”
8150	8152	8153	8153	he	418	whore—“timepieces , ”
8189	8242	8246	8246	he	418	“ This is an interesting outfit you ’re wearing , Count . Pricey . Do you and your compatriots draw straws for the cashmere overcoat and the Patek Philippe , or is there like a schedule for who gets to wear the rich playboy disguise when you ’re out stalking innocent people ? ”
8249	8256	8246	8246	he	418	“ I ’m not a count . ”
8257	8262	8246	8246	he	418	“ Hello ! Obviously ! ”
8263	8269	8246	8246	he	418	“ I ’m a marchese . ”
8282	8291	8270	8270	His	418	“ What is that , like a cheese ? ”
8321	8330	8318	8318	he	418	“ It ’s one rank above an earl . ”
8335	8353	8331	8331	I	329	“ Ah yes . One rank above an earl . Good place to be , I suppose . ”
8354	8372	8331	8331	I	329	“ It ’s also one rank below a duke , if that makes you feel any better . ”
8373	8378	8379	8379	Fuming	90	“ Oh , much . ”
8408	8487	8400	8400	I	329	“ How did you get into this lounge , anyway ? Bat your baby blues at the lady at the front desk ? Give her the ol’ razzle dazzle until her brain was a soggy mound of spaghetti ? God , you must be really useful for all kinds of jobs . Hey — was it you who got past security at Paris Hilton ’s New Year ’s Eve party and got all those shots up her skirt ? ”
8488	8494	8495	8495	he	447	“ You are very charming , ”
8504	8514	8495	8495	he	447	“ Very American . My mother would love you . ”
8515	8533	8400	8400	I	329	“ Ha ! I bet she would ! Where is she , in a federal correctional facility ? ”
8564	8573	8495	8495	he	447	“ Sorry , I did n’t get that . ”
8574	8586	8495	8495	he	447	“ I said , ‘ Do not disrespect my mother . ’ ”
8601	8649	8589	8589	I	329	“ Well , you ’re dedicated to your job , I ’ll give you that . You know , you should go into acting . Or modeling ! You could make bank . My best friend is a male model , and it ’s ridiculous how much — ”
8650	8656	8495	8495	he	447	“ Why are you sad ? ”
8695	8701	8702	8702	I	329	“ That ’s just mean , ”
8705	8714	8702	8702	I	329	“ That ’s just downright mean of you . ”
8715	8725	8763	8763	he	447	“ I ’m sorry , I do n’t understand — ”
8726	8734	8702	8702	I	329	“ Leave me alone . Go away . ”
8818	8824	8790	8790	He	447	“ Kimberella Gets Her Prince , ”
9062	9066	9058	9058	he	447	“ You too , ”
9102	9119	9153	9161	The woman in the red vest at the gate	459	“ No . That ca n’t be right . I have to be on this flight . ”
9120	9152	9153	9161	The woman in the red vest at the gate	459	“ I ’m so sorry , ma’am . Unfortunately , the flight was oversold . Your seat has been given to another passenger . There ’s really nothing I can do . ”
9203	9219	9194	9194	I	329	“ You ’re not listening to me . I have to be on this flight . ”
9220	9237	9238	9238	She	459	“ We can put you on standby for the next flight , which is . . . ”
9244	9250	9238	9238	She	459	“ Tomorrow at ten o’clock . ”
9251	9259	9194	9194	I	329	“ Tomorrow ? Are you kidding me ? ”
9295	9304	9292	9292	she	459	“ Here ’s a pamphlet regarding your rights — ”
9305	9318	9292	9292	she	459	“ I do n’t want your pamphlet . I want my seat . ”
9330	9367	9319	9319	She	459	“ We can offer you denied boarding compensation in the form of cash , check , or vouchers for a future flight , but I can not get you on this flight . I ’m sorry . ”
9404	9440	9401	9401	I	329	“ You do n’t understand . My father is dying . If I have to wait until tomorrow to get on a flight to Italy , he might already be dead when I get there . ”
9450	9477	9441	9441	She	459	“ Miss , I have other customers I have to assist . I really ca n’t do anything for you except what I ’ve already offered . ”
9485	9487	9478	9478	I	329	“ ma’am ”
9489	9491	9441	9441	She	459	“ miss ”
9526	9540	9516	9516	I	329	“ My father is dying ! I have to be on that flight ! ”
9541	9548	9587	9587	Her	462	“ I understand you ’re frustrated — ”
9549	9586	9516	9516	I	329	“ No , I ’m not frustrated , I ’m angry ! How can you just arbitrarily throw me off this plane ? I paid for my ticket like everyone else ! It ’s not fair ! ”
9680	9719	9648	9648	she	462	“ You need to bump someone else off this flight — someone whose father did n’t suffer a massive heart attack in another country ! There has to be some kind of consideration for emergency situations , right ? ”
9729	9732	9726	9726	I	329	“ Right ? ”
9733	9743	9648	9648	she	462	“ Please step away from the counter , miss . ”
9809	9867	9806	9806	I	329	“ Please . I ’m begging you . I have n’t seen my father in five years . He ’s the only family I have left . I have to be there for him . I have to get on this flight . If he dies and I ’m not there , I ’ll never forgive myself . ”
9886	9894	9872	9872	her	78	“ The lady can have my seat . ”
9931	9949	9950	9950	She	78	“ Oh , s - sir , that ’s very kind of you . Are you sure ? ”
9983	9988	9950	9950	She	78	“ I ’m sure . ”
10022	10049	9989	9989	He	434	“ Let me see if I can arrange it . We do allow transfers in some cases . May I have your boarding pass , please ? ”
10095	10102	10092	10092	I	329	“ You ’re on this flight ? ”
10112	10119	10103	10103	He	434	“ You ’re not a paparazzi ? ”
10120	10124	10125	10125	he	434	“ A paparazzo , ”
10128	10136	10125	10125	he	434	“ Not the last time I checked . ”
10144	10153	10137	10137	I	329	“ And , um , the count thing — ”
10154	10157	10158	10158	His	434	“ Marchese . ”
10165	10174	10158	10158	His	434	“ No , it ’s not a cheese . ”
10185	10195	10175	10175	I	329	“ Oh my God , I ’m so sorry . ”
10196	10199	10175	10175	I	329	“ Sir , ”
10229	10232	10217	10217	he	434	“ Yes ? ”
10233	10242	10250	10250	She	477	“ This is a first - class ticket . ”
10273	10279	10281	10282	Euro Hunk	434	“ Yes , it is , ”
10285	10291	10281	10282	Euro Hunk	434	“ Is there a problem ? ”
10312	10324	10292	10292	She	477	“ Not at all , sir . Your identification , please ? ”
10340	10355	10356	10358	The gate agent	461	“ Madam , may I have your boarding pass and identification again , please ? ”
10371	10374	10366	10366	I	329	“ madam . ”
10433	10442	10430	10430	I	329	“ I ca n’t let you do this . ”
10443	10449	10430	10430	I	329	“ Of course you can . ”
10450	10466	10430	10430	I	329	“ It ’s a wonderful gesture , but that ticket must ’ve cost a fortune . ”
10478	10495	10467	10469	The gate agent	461	“ The full fare for a first - class nonstop flight to Florence is $ 10,608 . ”
10523	10532	10510	10511	Euro Hunk	434	“ That ’s the round - trip fare . ”
10533	10567	10568	10568	He	461	“ I ’m sorry , but there ’s no way I can pay you back for that . As much as I ’d love to accept your generous offer , I ca n’t . ”
10588	10593	10579	10579	His	461	“ Your sketch pad . ”
10594	10597	10598	10598	I	329	“ What ? ”
10615	10630	10631	10631	He	461	“ Your sketch pad . I ’ll take it in trade for the ticket . ”
10765	10770	10749	10749	I	329	“ That ’s impossible . ”
10814	10825	10826	10826	He	461	“ I see . Best of luck with your father . ”
10847	10861	10826	10826	He	461	“ It seems I wo n’t be needing to transfer the ticket after — ”
10862	10865	10868	10868	I	329	“ Wait . ”
10889	10907	10878	10878	He	461	“ Why would you want the pad ? Is n’t there something else I can give you ? ”
10927	10934	10923	10923	I	329	“ That was n’t a proposition . ”
10935	10940	10878	10878	He	461	“ No ? Pity . ”
11367	11380	11390	11390	He	434	“ Here . Take it . Nothing is worth missing this flight . ”
11423	11427	11417	11417	he	434	“ Carry on . ”
11450	11455	11457	11458	Euro Hunk	434	“ These are incredible , ”
11535	11548	11549	11549	I	329	“ Yeah , well , they ’re yours now , so enjoy . ”
11604	11616	11651	11651	His	434	“ Just out of curiosity , why did you want them ? ”
11632	11639	11624	11624	His	434	“ I ’m an avid collector . ”
11645	11650	11640	11640	I	329	“ Of sketch pads ? ”
11665	11669	11651	11651	His	434	“ Of art . ”
11747	11750	11733	11733	I	329	“ Huh . ”
11751	11759	11771	11771	She	461	“ Okay , we ’re all set ! ”
11782	11819	11771	11771	She	461	“ I need both of you to sign these release forms , please . And I ’ve just checked you in , madam , so you can go ahead and board . Right through those doors . ”
11820	11823	11824	11824	I	329	“ Thanks . ”
11844	11856	11857	11857	I	329	“ And thank you . Sincerely . This is really amazing . ”
11861	11873	11857	11857	I	329	“ And sorry again about my behavior in the AmEx lounge . ”
11874	11892	11898	11898	He	329	“ If you really want to make it up to me , give me your phone number . ”
11984	11987	11988	11988	I	329	“ Sure , ”
11994	12001	11988	11988	I	329	“ Do you have a pen ? ”
12523	12552	12512	12512	she	503	“ My father is dying . I have to be there for him . If he dies and I ’m not there , I ’ll never forgive myself . ”
12659	12662	12666	12666	I	329	“ Si . ”
12669	12675	12666	12666	I	329	“ I have good news . ”
12685	12692	12666	12666	I	329	“ You hired a new designer ? ”
12729	12734	12693	12693	I	329	“ Something like that . ”
12756	12775	12735	12735	Antonio	100	“ Tell everyone to be ready to get to work as soon as I ’m back . Ciao . ”
12828	12835	12854	12854	I	329	“ Yeah ? Who ’s this ? ”
12857	12870	12854	12854	I	329	“ This is Matteo , Signor Marchese Moretti . Who is this ? ”
12879	12895	12871	12873	A boozy cackle	525	“ Who , me ? I ’m the Baron von fuckin ’ Trapp , bro . ”
12896	12904	12854	12854	I	329	“ Are you related to Miss Bobbitt ? ”
12905	12908	12871	12873	A boozy cackle	525	“ Who ? ”
12914	12923	12909	12909	I	329	“ Lorena Bobbitt . Does she live there ? ”
12936	12971	12991	12991	He	525	“ Is this some kinda fuckin ’ joke , bro ? You makin ’ a prank call ? ’Cause I ’ll put my fist right through this phone and rip off ya fuckin ’ — ”
12972	12975	12976	12976	I	329	“ Sir ! ”
12981	12990	12976	12976	I	329	“ Do you know the lady or not ? ”
12997	13037	13038	13038	He	525	“ Yeah , I know her . Everybody knows the broad who cut off her husband ’s dick while he was sleepin ’ , bro . Hey — is this bein ’ recorded ? Am I on the radio ? ”
13044	13053	13038	13038	He	525	“ Angie , I ’m on the radio ! ”
13326	13355	13319	13319	Brad	418	“ Hey , Kimber . Uh , it ’s me . Can you , uh , call me when you get a chance ? We need to talk . ”
13586	13589	13568	13568	He	2615	“ Tesoro ! ”
13659	13669	13670	13670	I	329	“ God , it ’s good to see you , ”
13677	13685	13670	13670	I	329	“ You have n’t changed a bit . ”
13694	13728	13691	13691	Dominic	2615	“ Eh , you ’re lying to an old man . But I forgive you . It ’s so good to see you , too . If only it were under happier circumstances . ”
13803	13812	13797	13797	Dominic	2615	“ My God , he looks dead already ! ”
13817	13831	13813	13813	Dominic	2615	“ I think he ’s only been holding on for you to arrive . ”
13860	13869	13851	13851	I	329	“ There ’s nothing the doctors can do ? ”
13879	13911	13870	13870	Dominic	2615	“ I ’m so sorry , tesoro . His heart was irreparably damaged . The doctors are surprised he ’s made it this long . He could go at any moment . ”
13949	13959	13945	13945	I	329	“ Dad ? Papa , can you hear me ? ”
14066	14071	14062	14062	He	2615	“ Have you eaten ? ”
14086	14093	14094	14094	He	2615	“ I ’ll get you something . ”
14188	14198	14183	14183	he	2615	“ Kimber , there ’s something you should know . ”
14219	14224	14211	14211	his	2615	“ What is it ? ”
14225	14231	14232	14232	He	2615	“ Your father . . . ”
14262	14267	14254	14254	I	329	“ My father what ? ”
14278	14283	14268	14268	Dominic	2615	“ He recently remarried . ”
14317	14324	14309	14309	I	329	“ He would ’ve told me . ”
14330	14383	14325	14325	Dominic	2615	“ He did n’t want to take any attention away from your wedding . He knew how excited you were , how long you ’d waited , how busy you were with all the plans . He thought it would be better until after you returned from your honeymoon to tell you . ”
14390	14422	14384	14384	I	329	“ My God , am I that self - centered ? My own father feels like he ca n’t share his good news with me because I ’ll throw a tantrum ? ”
14423	14428	14430	14430	Dominic	2615	“ No , tesoro , ”
14433	14446	14430	14430	Dominic	2615	“ It ’s not like that at all . You know better . ”
14544	14554	14555	14555	I	329	“ So I have a . . . stepmother . ”
14582	14593	14573	14573	I	329	“ Where is she ? Why is n’t she here ? ”
14600	14610	14594	14594	Dominic	2615	“ She ’s at the house with the girls . ”
14615	14621	14611	14611	I	329	“ Girls ? What girls ? ”
14642	14647	14636	14636	He	2615	“ Cornelia and Beans . ”
14738	14754	14755	14755	I	329	“ Okay . This is good . This is weird , but it ’s good . ”
14760	14806	14755	14755	I	329	“ You know what ? I ’m really happy about this . He ’s been alone too long . It ’s great that he finally found someone . I just wish I would ’ve known sooner . I would ’ve come out for the wedding — ”
14807	14812	14814	14814	Dominic	2615	“ It was sudden , ”
14823	14833	14834	14834	His	2615	“ He did n’t tell anyone it was happening . ”
14848	14853	14854	14854	Dominic	2615	“ Not even you ? ”
14859	14873	14854	14854	Dominic	2615	“ They were married at the town hall with no family or friends . ”
14874	14888	14854	14854	Dominic	2615	“ What ? That ’s crazy ! How did he meet this woman ? ”
14889	14899	14854	14854	Dominic	2615	“ She came into the shop and introduced herself . ”
14969	14976	14956	14958	The two men	565	“ So what ’s her deal ? ”
15071	15075	15076	15076	I	329	“ I see . ”
15085	15093	15076	15076	I	329	“ We ’ll discuss it more later . ”
15103	15111	15094	15094	He	310	“ Have you checked into your hotel ? ”
15112	15123	15125	15125	Dominic	2615	“ Hotel ? I planned to stay at the house . ”
15137	15150	15125	15125	Dominic	2615	“ But that was before I knew it would be so crowded . ”
15266	15274	15275	15275	he	2615	“ You ’re so much like her , ”
15278	15281	15306	15306	Tears	114	“ Who ? ”
15282	15286	15287	15287	He	2615	“ Your mother . ”
15298	15305	15287	15287	He	2615	“ God rest her precious soul . ”
15328	15337	15320	15320	I	329	“ I wish I would ’ve known her . ”
15338	15357	15358	15358	Dominic	2615	“ She was a very loving , patient woman , but she had the heart of a lion . ”
15365	15389	15390	15390	He	2615	“ Your grandmother was the same way . Lionhearted . And the stories I ’ve heard about your great - grandmother . . . ”
15397	15400	15390	15390	He	2615	“ Fantastico . ”
15429	15438	15401	15401	I	329	“ I need to talk to the doctor . ”
15439	15447	15448	15448	He	2615	“ I ’ll let the nurse know . ”
15456	15487	15448	15448	He	2615	“ I ’ve asked her for a date half a dozen times , but she always tells me she has a boyfriend . Ladies in their sixties are such teases . ”
15516	15519	15488	15488	He	2615	“ Kimberly . ”
15561	15564	15565	15565	I	329	“ Papa ! ”
15589	15603	15582	15582	his	310	“ Shh . Hush now , my angel . Everything is all right . ”
15625	15631	15622	15622	I	329	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
15640	15649	15635	15635	he	310	“ There ’s nothing to be sorry for . ”
15653	15672	15650	15650	I	329	“ But I have n’t seen you in so long ! I have n’t been here for you — ”
15673	15682	15683	15683	he	310	“ You were living your life , angel , ”
15686	15692	15699	15699	he	310	“ Just as you should . ”
15715	15722	15699	15699	he	310	“ I ’ll get the doctor ! ”
15768	15793	15794	15794	He	310	“ No . It ’s too late for doctors . Listen to me now , angel . I have something important to tell you . ”
15808	15823	15794	15794	He	310	“ Papa , please , do n’t talk ! Let me get the doctor — ”
15824	15834	15794	15794	He	310	“ Your mother was the love of my life . ”
15890	15943	15944	15944	I	329	“ From the day we met , I never looked at another woman . No one could compare . When she died , my heart became a wasteland where nothing could grow . You were the only thing that brought me joy , angel . The only thing that kept me going . ”
15957	15963	15964	15964	His	329	“ But life is strange . ”
15976	16007	15964	15964	His	329	“ Just when you think you ’ve got it figured out , it throws you a curveball to make sure you know you ’re not the one making the decisions . ”
16022	16042	16008	16008	He	329	“ I found love again , angel . In the winter of life , this old man found love . ”
16061	16070	16043	16043	I	329	“ I ’m happy for you , Papa . ”
16082	16100	16101	16101	He	329	“ I knew you would be . And I know you ’ll love her as I do . ”
16118	16181	16101	16101	He	329	“ Just remember : nothing worthwhile is easy . That goes for everything . The easier it comes , the easier it goes . The truly valuable things and people will always test your mettle , but every bit of pain will be worth it in the end . Do n’t give up when something is difficult . Dig in your heels . ”
16255	16258	16252	16252	I	329	“ Papa ? ”
16273	16276	16270	16270	I	329	“ Papa ? ”
16660	16668	16669	16669	he	2615	“ I ’ll come in with you , ”
16830	16836	16824	16824	He	610	“ Buonasera , Signor Dominic , ”
16882	16895	16879	16879	he	610	“ And you must be the beautiful daughter your father so loves . ”
16916	16937	16903	16903	Dominic	2615	“ Si , Lorenzo . This is Luca ’s daughter , Kimber . We ’ve just come from the hospital . ”
16981	16985	16975	16975	He	120	“ Mio Dio . ”
17005	17020	16987	16987	he	120	“ Come in , come in . Let me help you with your luggage . ”
17060	17069	17057	17057	Lorenzo	120	“ I ’ll make up the spare bedroom . ”
17070	17073	17079	17080	the family	457	“ Spare bedroom ”
17173	17177	17226	17226	Lorenzo	120	“ spare bedroom , ”
17186	17189	17190	17190	I	329	“ What ? ”
17197	17207	17190	17190	I	329	“ No — I’ll sleep in my old bedroom . ”
17232	17253	17226	17226	Lorenzo	120	“ Ahem . Unfortunately , that ’s not possible , signorina , as that room is now occupied by Cornelia . ”
17286	17324	17273	17273	I	329	“ Well , I ’m not sleeping in the attic . Give me some blankets , and I ’ll be fine on the drawing room sofa for the night . I ’ll check into a hotel tomorrow . ”
17356	17365	17366	17366	He	120	“ It ’s not your father ’s fault . ”
17373	17381	17366	17366	He	120	“ He did n’t have a choice . ”
17403	17414	17397	17399	The wicked stepmother	629	“ So this Lorenzo is what — the house man ? ”
17415	17418	17420	17420	Dominic	2615	“ Majordomo , ”
17422	17433	17420	17420	Dominic	2615	“ At least that ’s what the marchesa calls him . ”
17434	17440	17397	17399	The wicked stepmother	629	“ Who ’s the marchesa ? ”
17441	17448	17420	17420	Dominic	2615	“ Your father ’s new wife . ”
17453	17458	17449	17449	I	329	“ She ’s aristocracy ? ”
17459	17474	17475	17475	He	2615	“ From what I understand , she comes from a titled but impoverished background . ”
17481	17530	17531	17531	He	2615	“ You know how it is in Europe , tesoro . There are as many destitute barons and counts as there are churches . Many of the old aristocratic families lost their fortunes , but no matter how poor you become , you get to keep the title . ”
17535	17546	17531	17531	He	2615	“ It impresses people who do n’t know any better . ”
17547	17575	17576	17576	Dominic	2615	“ I know you want to add like Americans , but I ’ll have you know I met an aristocrat in New York and was n’t impressed . ”
17581	17614	17576	17576	Dominic	2615	“ That ’s because you have a good head on your shoulders . Now let ’s get you settled so you can get some rest . You ’re going to need it . ”
17875	17879	17880	17880	I	329	“ Good morning . ”
17893	17901	17902	17902	He	120	“ Ah , good morning , signorina . ”
17936	17954	17926	17926	he	120	“ What can I get you ? Espresso ? Eggs ? Some toast and jam , perhaps ? ”
17955	17967	17968	17968	He	120	“ You do n’t have to wait on me , Lorenzo . ”
17973	17980	17981	17981	He	120	“ But it ’s my pleasure . ”
17984	17991	17968	17968	He	120	“ Also it ’s my job . ”
17992	18003	17926	17926	he	120	“ In that case , I ’ll take an espresso . ”
18124	18128	18096	18096	he	120	“ Thank you . ”
18129	18134	18135	18135	He	120	“ You ’re welcome . ”
18156	18159	18096	18096	he	120	“ What ? ”
18160	18198	18135	18135	He	120	“ Forgive me for staring , signorina . It ’s just that I feel as if I already know you . Your father spoke of you so often , I feel as if we ’re old friends . ”
18236	18248	18224	18224	I	329	“ How long did you work for my father , Lorenzo ? ”
18249	18261	18224	18224	I	329	“ Since the marchesa and he were married , in June . ”
18298	18312	18295	18295	Lorenzo	120	“ But I ’ve been with the marchesa for more than thirty years . ”
18324	18328	18318	18318	I	329	“ Thirty years ? ”
18334	18356	18329	18329	He	120	“ Since before her first husband died . It has been my honor to serve in her household for so long . ”
18406	18420	18439	18439	I	329	“ You say it ’s been your honor to serve in her household ? ”
18427	18438	18421	18421	Lorenzo	120	“ I ’ve never known any other person as fine . ”
18496	18505	18506	18506	Lorenzo	120	“ Has she been told my father died ? ”
18522	18528	18506	18506	Lorenzo	120	“ Yes , of course . ”
18529	18532	18506	18506	Lorenzo	120	“ And ? ”
18543	18550	18533	18533	Lorenzo	120	“ I ’m sorry , signorina ? ”
18551	18570	18533	18533	Lorenzo	120	“ Well . . . was she upset ? What did she say ? How did she react ? ”
18597	18628	18594	18594	he	120	“ The marchesa does not share her feelings with her servants . And — forgive me — even if she did , I would n’t share them with anyone else . ”
18775	18799	18772	18772	Lorenzo	120	“ I apologize if what I said angered you , signorina . It was n’t my intention to be disrespectful , only honest . ”
18894	18900	18901	18901	I	329	“ I appreciate your honesty , ”
18918	18934	18901	18901	I	329	“ And I ’m sure you can appreciate how I might not be myself today . ”
18963	18990	18953	18953	My	329	“ The person I loved the most in the world is dead , and I ’m not above letting anyone know how I feel about it . ”
19185	19189	19191	19191	Lorenzo	120	“ Lady Moretti , ”
19196	19203	19204	19204	He	120	“ May I present signorina DiSanto . ”
19235	19243	19228	19228	Lorenzo	120	“ Kimber , this is Lady Moretti . ”
19300	19303	19296	19296	I	329	“ Hi . ”
19304	19309	19296	19296	I	329	“ Hello , Kimber . ”
19377	19394	19373	19373	she	62	“ Finally , I meet Luca ’s beloved daughter . Your father spoke of nothing else . ”
19415	19423	19407	19407	I	329	“ Funny , he never mentioned you . ”
19456	19470	19451	19451	Lorenzo	120	“ Ah , perhaps signorina DiSanto would like to meet Cornelia and Beans ? ”
19507	19518	19498	19498	she	62	“ Yes , I ’d like to meet my stepsisters . ”
19562	19565	19566	19566	she	62	“ Stepsisters , ”
19569	19575	19566	19566	she	62	“ That ’s very sweet . ”
19588	19592	19582	19582	I	329	“ your royal highnesses ”
19685	19688	19690	19690	Lorenzo	120	“ Cornelia ! ”
19692	19704	19690	19690	Lorenzo	120	“ Come now , silly girl , do n’t be afraid ! ”
19760	19768	19757	19757	I	329	“ You gave a dog my bedroom ? ”
19853	19858	19859	19859	I	329	“ Let me guess , ”
19863	19869	19859	19859	I	329	“ This must be Beans . ”
19887	19890	19891	19891	I	329	“ Yeah , ”
19899	19907	19891	19891	I	329	“ I know the feeling , sister . ”
19909	19915	19891	19891	I	329	“ You ’re shitting me . ”
19916	19992	20003	20003	his	418	“ I shit you not . They each have a bedroom of their own , and they eat their meals at the table . The big one ’s tall enough that it does n’t need a chair , it just sits on the floor and gobbles its food right off the plate , but the tiny evil one has a booster seat like they give kids at restaurants — only it ’s made of silk . ”
19993	19997	19999	19999	Jenner	418	“ Dear God , ”
20009	20019	19999	19999	Jenner	418	“ Dogs at the dining table ? How obscene . ”
20020	20031	20104	20104	I	329	“ What ’s really obscene are the dogs ’ wardrobes . ”
20032	20046	19999	19999	Jenner	418	“ Do n’t tell me . Your wicked stepmother has them wear dresses . ”
20047	20070	20104	20104	I	329	“ I ’ll do you one better : my wicked stepmother has them wear dresses that my poor father sewed by hand . ”
20079	20103	20076	20076	Jenner	418	“ Oh , honey . She must have a magical hoo - ha to be able to get a man to do that . ”
20107	20128	20104	20104	I	329	“ I ’d like to kick her right in her magical hoo - ha , I ’ll tell you what . ”
20287	20294	20275	20275	I	329	“ So when ’s the funeral ? ”
20295	20307	20275	20275	I	329	“ In three days . I made the arrangements this morning . ”
20497	20507	20508	20508	Jenner	418	“ And how are you holding up , Poppins ? ”
20512	20524	20508	20508	Jenner	418	“ This has been one hell of a week for you . ”
20601	20606	20607	20607	My	329	“ I ’m surviving . ”
20612	20656	20607	20607	My	329	“ Actually , I think I ’m in shock . It still does n’t seem real . Any of it . Brad , the wedding , my father , my father ’s secret wife . . . it all feels like a dream . ”
20657	20663	20665	20665	Jenner	418	“ Nightmare , more like , ”
20669	20675	20676	20676	I	329	“ Enough about my problems . ”
20689	20703	20676	20676	I	329	“ How are you doing ? What ’s new in the modeling world ? ”
20704	20739	20746	20746	he	686	“ You know , the usual : cocaine , bulimia , fake friends . I can hardly wait until I start to wrinkle so I can retire and do something meaningful with my life . ”
20825	20844	20845	20845	He	686	“ You ’re too pretty to wrinkle . You ’ve only gotten better looking since I met you . ”
20863	20885	20845	20845	He	686	“ I know . Let ’s talk about something else . Oh — tell me about all the gorgeous Italian men ! ”
20967	20991	21009	21009	I	329	“ I ’ve only met one gorgeous Italian , but that was in New York . But damn , he was a doozy . ”
20992	21008	21011	21011	him	310	“ I can hear the drool in your mouth , Poppins ! Tell me everything ! ”
21062	21074	21284	21284	Jenner	418	“ I did n’t give him my real number , dummy . ”
21075	21081	21041	21041	Jenner	418	“ Why on earth not ? ”
21082	21106	21284	21284	Jenner	418	“ Because , hello , I was just dumped at the altar ! I ’m not exactly in a man - loving mood ! ”
21107	21168	21041	21041	Jenner	418	“ Who said anything about loving ? Have revenge sex with him , silly ! Hell , have revenge sex with every Italian stud you meet ! What better way to get Brad out of your system ? Seriously , you ’re swimming in an ocean of testosterone over there , darling , dip your vadge in that beautiful sea ! ”
21173	21185	21169	21169	I	329	“ I think the saying is ‘ Dip your toe . ’ ”
21189	21226	21169	21169	I	329	“ Toe , vadge , whatever . Get it in there ! Swim in it ! Drown in it ! Good God , if it were me , I ’d be running naked through the streets ! ”
21227	21236	21169	21169	I	329	“ Yeah , I ’ve seen the pictures . ”
21242	21262	21237	21237	His	310	“ Do n’t be judgey , darling . It was my first show in Paris . I was seventeen . ”
21263	21283	21169	21169	I	329	“ Really ? What ’s your excuse for what happened last year at the Issey Miyake show in Tokyo ? ”
21288	21297	21284	21284	Jenner	418	“ It was my first time in Japan ! ”
21298	21316	21284	21284	Jenner	418	“ I see . Remind me not to go with you anywhere you have n’t been before . ”
21317	21329	21284	21284	Jenner	418	“ It ’s not like you have n’t seen me nude . ”
21330	21350	21284	21284	Jenner	418	“ The amount of people who have n’t seen you nude is a very small number , my friend . ”
21351	21354	21355	21355	he	418	“ Well , ”
21359	21376	21355	21355	he	418	“ one does what one can to spread beauty into the lives of the less fortunate . ”
21388	21399	21377	21377	I	329	“ Have I told you lately that I love you ? ”
21400	21424	21466	21466	I	329	“ You tell me alarmingly often , darling . For such a sharp , ball - busting businesswoman , you ’re awfully mushy . ”
21439	21450	21425	21425	He	418	“ Pfft . You adore it and you know it . ”
21458	21465	21451	21451	His	418	“ I adore you , Poppins . ”
21485	21496	21482	21482	I	329	“ You ’re the only family I have left now . ”
21501	21526	21497	21497	He	418	“ Oh God . Do n’t cry . You ’ll make me cry , and I ’ve just applied a forty - dollar mascara . ”
21539	21552	21553	21553	His	418	“ That ’s better . Now listen to me carefully , darling . ”
21558	21595	21553	21553	His	418	“ You ’re the baddest bitch I ’ve ever known . You will get through this . All of it . And you ’ll come out stronger on the other side . Do you hear me ? ”
21604	21607	21601	21601	I	329	“ Yes . ”
21608	21631	21673	21673	He	418	“ I ’m sorry , I did n’t catch that . Is there a mouse on the other end of the line ? ”
21632	21637	21601	21601	I	329	“ I said yes ! ”
21648	21672	21638	21638	He	418	“ Good . Stiff upper lip , Poppins . Tears are undignified . And remember — revenge sex is good for the complexion . ”
21841	21844	21845	21845	I	329	“ Wait . ”
21860	21866	21851	21852	The attorney	699	“ In English , please . ”
21879	21885	21868	21868	he	699	“ You do speak English ? ”
21886	21904	21921	21921	Heat	138	“ Of course I speak English . But why would I , when Italian is so superior ? ”
21938	21946	21935	21935	I	329	“ Because I do n’t speak Italian . ”
21972	21999	21953	21953	He	699	“ But you were born in this country , no ? And your parents were both Italian . Why would you not know your mother tongue ? ”
22024	22059	22019	22020	this idiot	447	“ Yes , I was born here , but I grew up in the States . I moved there when I was three years old and only came back for summer breaks from school . ”
22082	22133	22078	22078	I	329	“ When I went to live with my aunt , my father wanted me to be a ‘ real ’ American , okay ? He wanted me to fit in with all my friends , not be picked on for being a foreigner . He never spoke Italian to me . ”
22154	22161	22134	22135	The attorney	699	“ Never spoke Italian to you ? ”
22170	22177	22164	22164	he	699	“ But this is child abuse ! ”
22178	22192	22193	22193	Beans	113	“ Oh , for God ’s sake , just get on with it ! ”
22214	22233	22207	22207	I	329	“ One more peep out of you , dog , and I ’ll make you into a purse . ”
22234	22245	22253	22253	She	707	“ Per favore , Signor Rossi , continue in English , ”
22335	22344	22345	22345	he	329	“ Very well . In English , then , ”
22351	22356	22357	22357	He	329	“ Let us begin . ”
22517	22538	22567	22568	the attorney	699	“ Now , turning to the real estate . The house and property were recently assessed at fifteen million euro — ”
22539	22552	22567	22568	the attorney	699	“ Whoa ! Back up — did you say fifteen million euro ? ”
22553	22565	22567	22568	the attorney	699	“ That ’s roughly eighteen million dollars in your American money , ”
22616	22640	22606	22606	Her	124	“ Of course , you ca n’t sell the property while Lady Moretti is still alive . Without her permission , that is . ”
22659	22668	22648	22648	I	329	“ What ? Me ? Sell ? Huh ? ”
22694	22742	22669	22670	Signor Rossi	124	“ Your father left everything to you , Kimber . The business , the investments , Il Sogno — everything . The only stipulation on any of that being that you allow Lady Moretti to stay in the house until she dies , if she so wishes . ”
22772	22796	22768	22768	she	124	“ I would prefer to stay in the house , but if my stepdaughter would prefer I did not , I will move . ”
22826	22834	22823	22823	I	329	“ My father left me this house ? ”
22839	22842	22835	22836	Signor Rossi	124	“ Yes . ”
22843	22857	22835	22836	Signor Rossi	124	“ But . . . I ca n’t sell it until she dies ? ”
22858	22883	22835	22836	Signor Rossi	124	“ Unless Lady Moretti agrees to leave , which — if I understand her correctly — she will do if you ask her to . ”
22888	22893	22884	22885	The marchesa	124	“ That is correct . ”
23021	23040	23041	23042	The marchesa	124	“ If my father wanted you to stay until you die , you ’re staying until you die . ”
23058	23082	23056	23056	WS	133	“ But I ca n’t guarantee you wo n’t meet with any unfortunate accidents that might reduce your lifespan by a few decades . ”
23117	23177	23104	23105	The attorney	699	“ In regard to your father ’s business , DiSanto Couture has an excellent reputation for quality . However , based on a review of the books , it ’s operating at a loss . It ’s not sustainable at current levels of income versus debt , so the obvious course of action is to bring in a buyer . ”
23186	23202	23178	23179	Signor Rossi	124	“ Unless you ’d like to try to take it over and turn it around . ”
23203	23222	23269	23270	The marchesa	124	“ No . I ’m not staying here . I ’ve got to get back to the States . ”
23226	23268	23223	23223	He	699	“ We ’ll find a buyer . I recommend going through the inventory and repricing it to more competitive levels in order to boost the selling price . From what I can see , there ’s substantial room for improvement there . ”
23273	23282	23269	23270	The marchesa	124	“ I know someone who will be interested . ”
23291	23294	23296	23297	the attorney	699	“ Bene , ”
23307	23312	23302	23302	he	699	“ That means good . ”
23313	23320	23321	23321	He	699	“ I know what it means . ”
23347	23365	23333	23333	I	329	“ Are we done here ? Because I ’d like to check into the hotel before dinner . ”
23391	23398	23399	23399	I	329	“ Excuse me for a sec . ”
23404	23406	23399	23399	I	329	“ Answer ”
23418	23424	23399	23399	I	329	“ Hey , Mr. Drummond . ”
23425	23430	23399	23399	I	329	“ Hello , Kimber . ”
23488	23500	23518	23518	he	724	“ Is everything okay ? My rent check cleared , right ? ”
23501	23516	23518	23518	he	724	“ Yes , your check cleared . That ’s not why I ’m calling . ”
23530	23539	23518	23518	he	724	“ What is it ? What ’s wrong ? ”
23574	23581	23548	23548	he	724	“ There ’s been a fire . ”
23582	23586	23548	23548	he	724	“ A fire ? ”
23598	23657	23548	23548	he	724	“ The cause has n’t been determined yet , but it ’s bad . The whole block went up . I ’m standing across the street as we speak . I ’m sorry to be the one to tell you this , but your shop and everything in it is gone . There ’s nothing left but ashes . ”
23711	23750	23773	23773	MATTEO	398	“ Under the terms of your lease , you ’re responsible for your rent until you ’ve been cleared of any liability . I have no idea how long it ’ll take the authorities to determine what happened , so”—he
23752	23763	23806	23806	She	729	uncomfortably—“I’m still gon na need another check on the first . ”
23867	23874	23851	23851	She	729	“ Matteo ? Are you listening ? ”
23875	23884	23851	23851	She	729	“ Excuse me for a moment , Antonio . ”
23973	23978	23957	23957	I	329	“ You ’re upset . ”
24017	24020	24021	24021	she	729	“ You , ”
24061	24078	24046	24046	she	729	“ Buonasera , Miss Bobbitt . Cut off anyone ’s cock since I last saw you ? ”
24088	24095	24079	24079	She	729	“ The night ’s still young . ”
24108	24115	24079	24079	She	729	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
24116	24121	24079	24079	She	729	“ I live here . ”
24122	24127	24079	24079	She	729	“ In this bar ? ”
24128	24142	24079	24079	She	729	“ In this city . But I do come here often for drinks . ”
24153	24166	24143	24143	She	729	“ Get a little lonely up in your castle , do you ? ”
24167	24173	24174	24174	I	329	“ I ’m never lonely , ”
24250	24258	24228	24228	she	729	“ I want my sketch pad back . ”
24264	24276	24259	24259	I	329	“ Too bad you already traded it for a plane ticket . ”
24291	24297	24281	24281	she	729	“ How is your father ? ”
24312	24318	24306	24306	She	729	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
24350	24359	24338	24338	I	329	“ If there ’s anything I can do — ”
24366	24377	24378	24378	she	729	“ You can give me back my damn sketch pad ! ”
24412	24421	24422	24422	I	329	“ What will you give me in return ? ”
24425	24433	24422	24422	I	329	“ Since you enjoy bartering so much . ”
24441	24449	24438	24438	she	729	“ You know what — never mind . ”
24483	24492	24519	24519	She	729	“ How long will you be in Florence ? ”
24493	24499	24519	24519	She	729	“ None of your business . ”
24509	24518	24500	24501	Dio mio	122	“ I want to take you to dinner . ”
24527	24530	24519	24519	She	729	“ No . ”
24573	24576	24549	24549	Women	435	“ Breakfast ? ”
24577	24580	24549	24549	Women	435	“ No . ”
24581	24594	24549	24549	Women	435	“ Hmm . I suppose lunch is also out of the question ? ”
24595	24609	24549	24549	Women	435	“ I ’m not interested in eating food with you , Count Egotistico . ”
24610	24622	24549	24549	Women	435	“ I ’ve already told you I ’m not a count . ”
24623	24635	24549	24549	Women	435	“ Yeah , I heard . Whoop - dee - do . ”
24645	24669	24636	24636	I	329	“ So if you ’re not interested in eating food with me , bella , what are you interested in doing with me ? ”
24688	24703	24681	24681	I	329	“ Because we both know you ’re interested in something . And so am I. ”
24729	24739	24710	24710	She	729	“ I do n’t do one - night stands . ”
24740	24749	24710	24710	She	729	“ How many nights will you be here ? ”
24800	24806	24788	24788	she	729	“ Five . Maybe six . ”
24831	24851	24816	24816	I	329	“ Plenty of time to show me exactly how much you dislike men with oversize . . . egos . ”
24880	24887	24877	24877	she	729	“ I dislike them a lot . ”
24940	24982	24937	24937	I	329	“ Then you ’re really going to hate me . You ’ll hate me over and over and over . I ’ll make sure , bella , that you ’ll hate me more than any other man you ’ll ever meet . ”
25009	25031	24998	24998	She	306	“ Okay , fancypants , you ’re on . I ’m in room four - twelve . Give me ten minutes . ”
25132	25137	25129	25129	he	100	“ Someone you know ? ”
25164	25176	25138	25138	I	329	“ Let ’s call it a night . Something came up . ”
25193	25196	25177	25177	Antonio	100	“ Evidently . ”
25658	25661	25670	25670	I	329	“ Hello ? ”
25662	25665	25670	25670	I	329	“ Buonasera , ”
25675	25683	25684	25684	I	329	“ How did you get this number ? ”
25701	25774	25684	25684	I	329	“ I have friends at the front desk . Apparently you made quite an impression when you checked in . All I had to say was ‘ Beautiful American , ’ and they connected me to your room straightaway . Speaking of rooms , the lady in four - twelve was very nice , but I prefer my women to have their real teeth and be able to walk without a cane . ”
25794	25816	25790	25790	I	329	“ Really ? I ’d have thought as long as a woman was breathing , you ’d be good to go . ”
25817	25838	25684	25684	I	329	“ You ’d have thought wrong . I ’m very particular . My last serious relationship was three years ago . ”
25844	25893	25839	25839	I	329	“ Sure . Listen — I’m grateful to you for that ticket . Sincerely , I am . And if you ’ll give me your address , I swear I ’ll find a way to pay you back . But I ’m not interested in sleeping with you . ”
25905	25929	25839	25839	I	329	“ I ’m burying my father in a few days — I’m not in the mood for . . . whatever this is . ”
26062	26086	26057	26058	Euro Hunk	434	“ I understand . And I ’m sorry about your father . I know how hard it is to lose someone you love . ”
26121	26128	26129	26129	I	329	“ Because you ’re an idiot , ”
26478	26481	26483	26483	Lorenzo	120	“ Buongiorno , ”
26490	26497	26483	26483	Lorenzo	120	“ You look lovely this morning . ”
26521	26534	26515	26515	he	120	“ Thank you . And you look very dapper , as always . ”
26543	26557	26558	26558	He	120	“ Come in . Lady Moretti is waiting for you in the library . ”
26617	26620	26611	26611	she	124	“ Hello . ”
26637	26654	26611	26611	she	124	“ Kimber , what can I offer you ? Coffee ? Water ? Anything to eat ? ”
26691	26697	26683	26683	I	329	“ Nothing , thank you . ”
26741	26762	26737	26737	She	124	“ I ’m sorry your husband did n’t come with you . I would have liked to have met him . ”
26786	26793	26777	26777	she	124	“ The wedding was called off . ”
26794	26798	26808	26808	she	124	“ Called off ? ”
26811	26827	26808	26808	she	124	“ I assume your father did n’t know , or he would have told me . ”
26884	26893	26872	26872	I	329	“ It only happened a few days ago . ”
26902	26916	26927	26927	she	124	“ You called off the wedding . . . because of . . . ”
26917	26920	26921	26921	I	329	“ No , ”
26937	26948	26927	26927	she	124	“ I was n’t the one who called it off . ”
27004	27015	27000	27000	She	124	“ Your fiancé left you because your father was sick ? ”
27033	27068	27030	27030	she	124	“ It was before that . Brad did n’t know Papa was sick . I did n’t know Papa was sick . I got Dominic ’s letter a few days after we broke up . ”
27198	27203	27195	27195	She	124	“ Bene . Grazie . ”
27370	27375	27393	27393	he	777	“ Ciao , Mamma , ”
27442	27452	27438	27439	The marchesa	124	“ Ciao , Matteo . Come in , son . ”
27600	27611	27594	27595	the marchesa	124	“ Matteo , this is Kimber . Luca ’s daughter . ”
27621	27626	27627	27627	He	398	“ We ’ve met . ”
27666	27682	27663	27663	he	398	“ Your father was a wonderful man . I ’m so sorry for your loss . ”
27706	27712	27714	27715	the marchesa	124	“ You ’ve already met ? ”
27741	27758	27738	27738	I	329	“ Your son is the reason I was able to see my father before he died . ”
27849	27852	27853	27853	I	329	“ Wait , ”
27858	27886	27853	27853	I	329	“ You knew about ruching . You told me to add ruching to the sketch of the dress I was drawing . And your clothes . . . ”
27926	27949	27916	27916	I	329	“ If you use any of the designs I gave you , I ’ll sue you so fast your head will spin ! ”
27966	27973	27950	27950	His	398	“ Faster than your mood swings ? ”
27974	27980	27950	27950	His	398	“ Those are my designs ! ”
27981	27999	27950	27950	His	398	“ Incorrect . They ’re mine . As you just said , you gave them to me . ”
28000	28007	27950	27950	His	398	“ Under duress ! From necessity ! ”
28008	28038	27950	27950	His	398	“ So you do n’t think it was a fair trade ? You ’d rather have your sketch pad back than to have seen your father before he died ? ”
28056	28063	28053	28053	I	329	“ You son of a bitch . ”
28078	28098	28068	28068	I	329	“ I do n’t quite understand what ’s happening , but let ’s all calm down , shall we ? ”
28099	28121	28122	28122	I	329	“ Lady , I ’m so far from calm I ’d have to send out a search party to find it . ”
28127	28140	28122	28122	I	329	“ Why did n’t you tell me the buyer was your son ? ”
28165	28173	28141	28141	She	124	“ Why does that make a difference ? ”
28174	28182	28183	28183	I	329	“ Gee , where should I start ? ”
28187	28211	28183	28183	I	329	“ It ’s a pretty crafty way to get your hands on some of Papa ’s money , I ’ll give you that . ”
28227	28273	28212	28212	Her	124	“ I would never have mentioned the sale to Matteo if he were n’t capable of handling the business and honoring Luca ’s artistic vision . The House of Moretti is among the most respected ateliers in fashion . Perhaps you ’ve heard of it ? ”
28324	28332	28313	28313	I	329	“ Ca n’t say that I have . ”
28388	28397	28398	28398	I	329	“ Not that you ’d care to know , ”
28414	28427	28398	28398	I	329	“ but my father ’s last words to me were about you . ”
28457	28509	28450	28450	I	329	“ And he gave me a piece of advice I did n’t realize would come in handy so soon . He told me not to give up when things get difficult . His exact words were ‘ Dig in your heels . ’ So this is me digging in my heels . ”
28541	28557	28510	28510	I	329	“ I ’m not selling the business . I ’m going to run it myself . ”
28562	28565	28572	28572	Matteo	398	“ What ? ”
28614	28642	28610	28610	I	329	“ Oh , wait . I think I have heard of you — didn’t I read somewhere that the House of Moretti recently lost its head designer ? ”
28658	28665	28654	28654	He	398	“ I am the head designer . ”
28707	28749	28750	28751	The marchesa	124	“ Not really hands on , though , I ’d guess . I ca n’t picture you with rolled - up sleeves , pinning cloth on mannequins , working deep into the night . Probably too busy running around with supermodels . ”
28754	28762	28750	28751	The marchesa	124	“ My son does n’t date models . ”
28772	28784	28763	28763	I	329	“ Do you pick out his underwear for him , too ? ”
28788	28794	28785	28785	Matteo	398	“ Stop with the disrespect ! ”
28799	28837	28785	28785	Matteo	398	“ Do n’t you dare talk to me about disrespect ! Your precious mother did n’t have enough respect for my father to visit him in the hospital while he was dying , did you know that ? ”
28868	28873	28863	28864	the marchesa	124	“ Please excuse me , ”
28942	28948	28949	28949	he	398	“ You and your mouth , ”
28984	28993	28978	28978	He	398	“ And your attitude , and your selfishness — ”
28999	29003	28994	28994	I	329	“ My selfishness ? ”
29004	29010	29011	29011	he	398	“ And your bad manners ! ”
29014	29036	29011	29011	he	398	“ Did it ever occur to you that not everyone wants the whole world to know when they ’re in pain ? ”
29118	29158	29111	29111	I	329	“ I ’m sorry my grief is so offensive to you . I have this thing called a heart . I ’m not the kind of person who ’s able to pretend everything is fine when it ’s bleeding . ”
29179	29182	29167	29167	he	398	“ Wait . ”
29183	29190	29191	29191	I	329	“ Get your hands off me . ”
29210	29219	29167	29167	he	398	“ Kimber , stop . Stop . Please . ”
29264	29269	29246	29246	He	398	“ Look at me . ”
29270	29275	29246	29246	He	398	“ Go to hell . ”
29276	29287	29246	29246	He	398	“ Stop acting like a child . Look at me . ”
29463	29479	29480	29480	I	329	“ You ’re my stepbrother . You should n’t be looking at me like that . ”
29515	29518	29519	29519	he	398	“ Stepbrother , ”
29544	29550	29533	29533	he	398	“ What an interesting development . ”
29702	29708	29709	29709	he	398	“ Where is your husband ? ”
29714	29733	29709	29709	he	398	“ Did n’t your father tell me you were getting married ? You ’re not wearing a ring . ”
29754	29760	29748	29748	I	329	“ There ’s no husband . ”
29796	29804	29805	29805	I	329	“ I pushed him off a cliff , ”
29813	29826	29805	29805	I	329	“ He took something of mine and would n’t give it back . ”
29860	29872	29846	29846	Matteo	398	“ Ah . So that ’s what happened to your dignity . ”
29890	29924	29884	29884	I	329	“ That ’s right . He humiliated me completely . But he did it because he ’s immature . You just did it because it made you feel good . Which is worse ? ”
29986	29997	29982	29982	He	398	“ You ca n’t be serious about keeping the company . ”
30005	30011	29998	29998	I	329	“ And why is that ? ”
30035	30065	30032	30032	I	329	“ If you ’re about to make a nasty comment about my gender , my brains , or my style , I ’m about to neuter your smug ass . ”
30091	30099	30076	30076	Him	398	“ What is it with your hostility ? ”
30100	30108	30032	30032	I	329	“ What is it with your arrogance ? ”
30109	30122	30076	30076	Him	398	“ There ’s a big difference between self - confidence and arrogance . ”
30123	30156	30032	30032	I	329	“ Yeah , there is , and any man who propositions a woman in an airport lounge after a thirty - second conversation lands squarely on the arrogance side of that equation . ”
30157	30170	30076	30076	Him	398	“ I did n’t proposition you . I said I wanted you . ”
30171	30182	30032	30032	I	329	“ You ’re splitting hairs . The intent was clear . ”
30191	30205	30183	30183	He	398	“ You think I do that all the time , is that it ? ”
30206	30218	30076	30076	Him	398	“ I honestly do n’t care one way or the other . ”
30219	30242	30183	30183	He	398	“ You ’ll have to learn to lie better than that if you ’re going to succeed in fashion here , bella . ”
30282	30292	30269	30270	the man	398	“ I do n’t need business advice from you . ”
30293	30299	30300	30300	He	398	“ This is n’t America . ”
30311	30323	30302	30302	America	22	“ This is Italy . The fashion capital of the planet — ”
30324	30331	30269	30270	the man	398	“ Tell that to the French . ”
30342	30371	30332	30332	He	398	“ And a girl from San Francisco — not even New York — who owns a sweet little dress shop is in no way prepared to compete here . ”
30372	30418	30302	30302	America	22	“ Wow . I ’m not sure which was worse : the sexism in that statement , or the sheer snobbism . I ’m insulted on behalf of my gender and my country . And how do you know so much about me , anyway ? ”
30424	30432	30419	30419	His	398	“ Your father spoke of you often . ”
30437	30447	30433	30433	My	329	“ You . . . spent time with him ? ”
30448	30467	30419	30419	His	398	“ Yes . There were dinners , visits here , or to my home . We became close . ”
30519	30523	30518	30518	They	821	“ became close . ”
30608	30627	30605	30605	Matteo	398	“ I ’ll give you a good price for the company . Better than anyone else would offer . ”
30628	30646	30605	30605	Matteo	398	“ So you can turn around and give all the money to your mother ? No thanks . ”
30647	30655	30656	30656	he	398	“ My mother does n’t need money , ”
30681	30689	30690	30690	He	398	“ That ’s not what I heard . ”
30694	30700	30690	30690	He	398	“ Who told you that ? ”
30701	30736	30690	30690	He	398	“ It does n’t make any difference . You ’re not getting the business either way . Go back to your castle and holler at your servants . I ’m done with this conversation . ”
30790	30835	30912	30912	He	398	“ So your plan is to give up your entire life in America just to spite me ? And my mother , whom you obviously dislike ? You ’re going to move here , to a country whose language you do n’t even speak — ”
30841	30852	30836	30836	I	329	“ How do you know I do n’t speak Italian ? ”
30853	30889	30895	30895	his	398	“ Your father told me . He told me many things about you . He spoke of your kindness . And your strength . And your intelligence . He made you sound like Wonder Woman . ”
30898	30911	30895	30895	his	398	“ The only thing to wonder is how well he knew you . ”
30969	30990	30991	30991	His	398	“ He never mentioned your temper . Or the way you make snap judgments before you get to know people . ”
31005	31010	30991	30991	His	398	“ Or that mouth . ”
31062	31084	31085	31085	His	398	“ I guess he left out the bad parts . Like Mommy Dearest would no doubt do when talking about you . ”
31103	31168	31098	31098	I	329	“ I ’m happy to fill you in , though . I ’m stubborn . Like a mule . I ’m super competitive . My friends wo n’t play Scrabble with me anymore because of all the screaming . And when I die , I ’ll need two caskets — one for me and one for all my grudges . And the only thing keeping you”—I
31176	31219	31098	31098	I	329	chest—“off my permanent shit list is that plane ticket . Which I will pay you back for , even if it kills me , because I ’d rather be down to my last cent than be indebted to a rival in business . ”
31280	31286	31276	31276	He	398	“ A rival in business . ”
31308	31324	31325	31325	He	398	“ All right . Rivals it is . Best of luck with your new endeavor . ”
31346	31371	31340	31340	he	398	“ And technically , since your father died , I ’m your ex - stepbrother . I ’ll look at you however I want . ”
31437	31457	31479	31479	I	329	“ Dominic , I need a lift to my hotel , then Papa ’s shop . Are you available ? ”
31458	31463	31479	31479	I	329	“ Certo . When ? ”
31464	31467	31479	31479	I	329	“ Now . ”
31473	31478	31479	31479	I	329	“ Er , now ? ”
31551	31563	31611	31611	I	329	“ I ’m sorry . I know it ’s short notice . ”
31653	31659	31650	31650	Dominic	2615	“ Give me twenty minutes . ”
31660	31668	31669	31669	I	329	“ Thank you ! See you soon . ”
31686	31693	31679	31679	he	2615	“ I ’m moving to Florence . ”
31696	31704	31650	31650	Dominic	2615	“ Did you hear what I said ? ”
31705	31751	31650	31650	Dominic	2615	“ Yes . I ’m just trying to picture what the kidnapper holding a gun to your head looks like . I ’ve always had a fantasy about being held hostage by a brute of a man with too many tattoos and a limited vocabulary . ”
31752	31763	31650	31650	Dominic	2615	“ Do n’t be silly . There ’s no kidnapper . ”
31764	31777	31650	31650	Dominic	2615	“ So it ’s drugs , then . You ’re on drugs . ”
31778	31787	31650	31650	Dominic	2615	“ You know I do n’t do drugs . ”
31791	31800	31801	31801	He	2615	“ You ’re not actually serious , Poppins . ”
31834	31844	31801	31801	He	2615	“ Are you ready to hear something really freaky ? ”
31845	31853	31801	31801	He	2615	“ I ’m waiting with bated breath . ”
31862	31888	31854	31854	I	329	“ Remember the guy I told you about , the gorgeous Italian who I met in New York and gave the fake phone number to ? ”
31889	31906	31801	31801	He	2615	“ Yes . Your description of his suit gave me an erection . What about him ? ”
31907	31915	31854	31854	I	329	“ He ’s here . In Florence . ”
31919	31925	31916	31916	Jenner	418	“ You saw him again ? ”
31926	31939	31801	31801	He	2615	“ Oh , honey , that ’s not even the best part . ”
31948	31952	31940	31940	I	329	“ Revenge sex ? ”
31953	31956	31801	31801	He	2615	“ Kinkier . ”
31964	31976	31957	31957	His	2615	“ Oh my God — are we talking Christian Grey kinky ? ”
31977	31983	31957	31957	His	2615	“ Waay kinkier than that . ”
31984	32005	31957	31957	His	2615	“ Tell me before I die ! Is he a sadist ? A dominant ? A genius with knotting ropes ? ”
32006	32012	31957	31957	His	2615	“ He ’s my stepbrother . ”
32035	32044	32029	32029	Jenner	418	“ Did you say . . . stepbrother ? ”
32045	32062	31957	31957	His	2615	“ I did . Well , technically speaking , he ’s my ex - stepbrother now . ”
32063	32127	32029	32029	Jenner	418	“ Hold on . Let me make sure I ’m following . What you ’re telling me is that you met a gorgeous man at the airport in New York whom you had an instant sexual attraction to , gave a fake phone number to , whom you then met again in Florence . . . and turned out to be related to ? ”
32128	32138	31957	31957	His	2615	“ I ’m saving the best part for last . ”
32139	32144	32145	32145	Jenner	418	“ There ’s more ? ”
32148	32185	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ I did n’t tell you that I was bumped off my flight to Florence . . . but got on the flight because he gave me his plane ticket . His first - class ticket . ”
32186	32189	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ Rubbish ! ”
32190	32195	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ It ’s true ! ”
32196	32205	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ Why would he give you his ticket ? ”
32206	32241	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ Because he overheard me arguing with the gate agent . I told her I had to be on the flight because my father was dying . He stepped in to save the day . ”
32242	32256	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ That ’s just about the most romantic thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
32272	32294	32267	32267	My	329	“ Do n’t pass out yet , because in trade for this ticket , he made me give him . . . ”
32302	32313	32295	32295	Jenner	418	“ What ? What did he make you give him ? ”
32348	32358	32344	32344	I	329	“ He made me give him my sketch pad . ”
32366	32373	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ I ’ve lost the plot . ”
32374	32392	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ You know , my sketch pad . The one I always use to design my dresses — ”
32393	32425	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ Yes , yes , of course I know . You ’re always carrying the wretched thing around like a security blanket . Why would he want that dreadful tattered book ? ”
32426	32433	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ Are you still sitting down ? ”
32434	32458	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ Not only am I sitting down , I ’m ruining my manicure gnawing on my cuticles ! Spill , bitch , spill ! ”
32459	32466	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ He ’s a fashion designer . ”
32489	32511	32359	32359	Jenner	418	“ And not just any fashion designer . You ’ll recognize his name . You own a few of his suits . ”
32512	32515	32516	32516	He	418	“ Oh . ”
32523	32554	32516	32516	He	418	“ I ’m having a stroke . I ’m having a heart attack . I ’ve burst a vessel in my brain . Who is it , Poppins ? Who ? ”
32565	32569	32555	32555	I	329	“ Matteo Moretti . ”
32594	32599	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ Shut . Up ! ”
32600	32606	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ I ’m telling you . ”
32607	32612	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ You . Liar ! ”
32613	32618	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ Swear to God . ”
32619	32622	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ No ! ”
32623	32633	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ Yes , honey . One thousand percent yes . ”
32648	32655	32576	32576	Jenner	418	“ Jenner ! Are you there ? ”
32656	32663	32664	32664	he	1931	“ Do you have any idea , ”
32668	32684	32664	32664	he	1931	“ any idea how many times I ’ve masturbated to the thought of Matteo Moretti ? ”
32690	32695	32685	32685	I	329	“ Dude . TMI . ”
32696	32729	32765	32765	Jenner	418	“ My God , Poppins , he ’s the most beautiful man who ever lived . Did you see the spread of him in Italian GQ when he first launched his company ? ”
32730	32764	32685	32685	I	329	“ No . I ’d never seen a picture of him before . I had no idea what he looked like , which is why I did n’t recognize him at the airport ! ”
32775	32795	32765	32765	Jenner	418	“ Matteo . Oh , my dear sweet Matteo . J’taime . J’adore . Tu es tout pour moi — ”
32796	32808	32809	32809	He	418	“ Please tell me you ’re not touching yourself right now . ”
32812	32815	32809	32809	He	418	“ Puritan . ”
32816	32839	32809	32809	He	418	“ Can we get this train back on track ? My point of this story is that I ’m moving to Florence ! ”
32913	32916	32917	32917	he	418	“ Darling , ”
32921	32968	32917	32917	he	418	“ it ’s best not to make such huge life decisions when you ’re grieving . Moving to another country on a whim is n’t like you . You ’re dependable . Reliable . Grounded . What you need right now is therapy , not Italy . ”
32969	32983	32917	32917	he	418	“ Give me one reason why I should come back to the States . ”
32984	32987	32917	32917	he	418	“ Me . ”
33004	33043	33001	33001	me	329	“ I happen to know for a fact that you come to Italy twice a year for Fashion Week . It ’s not like we ’d never see each other again . You ’ll be here next month . ”
33051	33066	33044	33044	He	418	“ Need I remind you that you already have a business to run here ? ”
33067	33081	33044	33044	He	418	“ Oh yeah . I did n’t tell you about what happened yet . ”
33090	33095	33082	33082	My	329	“ Uh - oh . ”
33096	33112	33044	33044	He	418	“ Uh - oh is right . There was this fire , see . . . ”
33129	33142	33126	33126	Jenner	418	“ No . The universe ca n’t possibly hate you that much . ”
33161	33269	33143	33143	I	329	“ Apparently the universe has put me at the top of its most - hated list . I got a call from my landlord yesterday . The shop went up in flames , along with everything in it . My entire life there is gone . Even if I did come back , what would I return to ? All that ’s left is an apartment that is n’t mine and a reputation as Bradley Wingate ’s sloppy seconds . Who ’d want me ? I ’ll always be the girl who was dumped at the altar . I ’ll never be able to live that down . ”
33281	33299	33270	33270	We	846	“ I suppose this is as good a time as any to tell you I saw him . ”
33316	33321	33306	33306	My	329	“ When ? How ? ”
33322	33343	33270	33270	We	846	“ He came to my apartment . I made the mistake of opening the door without asking who it was . ”
33362	33368	33344	33344	I	329	“ What did he want ? ”
33369	33375	33306	33306	My	329	“ To talk to you . ”
33383	33390	33377	33377	Jenner	418	“ What are you leaving out ? ”
33395	33419	33391	33391	He	418	“ I debated whether I should tell you this , but he looked wrecked . Like he had n’t slept since the wedding . ”
33420	33424	33425	33425	I	329	“ The nonwedding , ”
33443	33451	33435	33435	Jenner	418	“ And good , I ’m glad ! ”
33466	33470	33458	33458	I	329	“ What else ? ”
33471	33475	33453	33453	Jenner	418	“ He cried . ”
33498	33515	33476	33476	I	329	“ I ’m sorry , I thought I just heard you tell me that Brad cried . ”
33516	33520	33458	33458	I	329	“ I did . ”
33524	33570	33521	33521	I	329	“ Brad does n’t cry ! I do n’t think he even owns tear ducts ! He yawned through his grandmother ’s funeral ! When the family dog got hit by a car , Brad suggested his mother turn it into mulch for her roses ! ”
33571	33633	33476	33476	I	329	“ Well , darling , unless the man recently took up method acting , these tears were bona fide . He sat on my sofa and sobbed like a baby . When I told him your father had died , I thought he ’d pass out . He even tried to hug me when he left , if you can imagine . ”
33667	33695	33521	33521	I	329	“ Why would you tell him about my father ? Why would you tell that asshole anything ? Why would you even let him through your door ? ”
33696	33758	33802	33802	Jenner	418	“ Because the first thing out of his mouth was that he knew he cocked the whole thing up . And the second thing out of his mouth was that he was the biggest idiot on the planet and did n’t deserve you . Since we were in such agreement about the basics , I thought I ’d hear him out . ”
33759	33767	33768	33768	I	329	“ He left me at the altar ! ”
33778	33793	33768	33768	I	329	“ He humiliated me ! I hate his guts and wish he was dead ! ”
33794	33800	33802	33802	Jenner	418	“ Except you do n’t , ”
33823	33875	33820	33820	Jenner	418	“ Do you remember what you said when I told you that I ’d never seen you so happy after you and Brad started dating ? You said , ‘ Every time I look at him , I feel like it ’s the first time I ’ve seen the sun . ’ ”
33876	33882	33883	33883	I	329	“ I was a fool , ”
33897	33906	33820	33820	Jenner	418	“ Maybe . And maybe so was he . ”
33919	34010	33914	33914	Jenner	418	“ I ’m not saying give him a second chance . I know it ’s beyond that . I ’m saying maybe just . . . listen to what he has to say . For your own peace of mind . For closure , if nothing else . If he really did n’t care about your feelings , he never would ’ve sat there and let me vomit my disdain all over him . He took it for half an hour , darling , nodding and crying the entire time . ”
34061	34151	34058	34058	he	847	“ I ca n’t deal with this shit right now . I ’ve got a wicked stepmother , canine stepsisters , and an arrogant , infuriating stepbrother I ’d like to do all kinds of dirty things with . I ’ve got my father ’s funeral to attend , his business to salvage , and my former life to kiss goodbye . I ’ve got no money and nowhere to live except under the same roof as the woman who refused to visit my father when he was dying . ”
34158	34241	34152	34152	I	329	“ I am not living my best life right now , okay ? The last thing I need to hear about is fucking Brad and his fucking regrets . If you see him again , tell him that if he really wants to make it up to me , he can slice off his balls , put them in a blender , and live stream it on the internet ! Then maybe he ’ll start to have an idea how I feel ! ”
34428	34434	34436	34436	Dominic	2615	“ You ’re quiet today , ”
34563	34573	34574	34574	I	329	“ It ’s exactly the same as I remember , ”
34601	34632	34633	34633	He	2615	“ Your father recently hired helpers , three ladies he trained to take orders and measurements , cut the cloth . The sewing he always did himself , of course . ”
34649	34657	34658	34658	He	2615	“ Still no answering machine , though . ”
34665	34669	34658	34658	He	2615	“ Or computer . ”
34670	34690	34691	34691	Dominic	2615	“ Or website . It ’s like he did n’t believe the twenty - first century was a thing . ”
34694	34728	34691	34691	Dominic	2615	“ He only got an email address so he could communicate with you . If they did n’t have computers for public use at the library , he would ’ve kept sending letters . ”
34796	34803	34791	34791	I	329	“ No wonder he was broke . ”
34847	34863	34864	34864	Dominic	2615	“ I offered many times to assist , but you know how stubborn he was . ”
34910	34936	34897	34897	I	329	“ Okay . First I ’ve got to go through the inventory and reprice everything . Then we need to look at the advertising budget — ”
34937	34940	34941	34941	Dominic	2615	“ Advertising ? ”
34944	34959	34897	34897	I	329	“ Do n’t tell me he was still relying only on word of mouth ? ”
34965	34973	34960	34960	Dominic	2615	“ Old dog . No new tricks . ”
34992	35031	34974	34974	I	329	“ Can you drop my luggage off at the house for me ? I ’m not sure how late I ’ll get back , and it ’ll be easier for me to come in without all my stuff . ”
35038	35047	35032	35032	Dominic	2615	“ You ’re not moving to another hotel ? ”
35048	35059	35060	35060	His	2615	“ Nope . I ’m moving in with the marchesa . ”
35070	35103	35060	35060	His	2615	“ It ’s a long story . The bottom line is that I ’ve decided I ’m not selling Papa ’s business . I ’m going to stay here and run it . ”
35116	35125	35104	35104	Dominic	2615	“ Is your husband moving here , too ? ”
35141	35146	35132	35132	I	329	“ We broke up . ”
35378	35387	35388	35388	Dominic	2615	“ I ’m so sorry to hear that . ”
35410	35419	35392	35392	He	2615	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”
35485	35492	35475	35475	I	329	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
35524	35536	35514	35514	he	2615	“ I was in the neighborhood and saw the lights on . ”
35537	35540	35493	35493	He	2615	“ Liar . ”
35549	35565	35541	35541	His	2615	“ You know what they say . Keep your friends close and your enemies closer . ”
35566	35588	35514	35514	he	2615	“ They also say you do n’t have to be a cactus expert to know a prick when you see one . ”
35593	35609	35589	35589	His	2615	“ Is it just my dick you ’re obsessed with , or dicks in general ? ”
35610	35627	35628	35628	He	2615	“ Do n’t flatter yourself . And while you ’re busy not flattering yourself , leave . ”
35645	35648	35641	35641	he	2615	“ No , ”
35673	35693	35641	35641	he	2615	“ Oh , I get it . On the lookout for more designs to steal , is that it ? ”
35702	35729	35641	35641	he	2615	“ You seem to have a mental block about the facts , so let me remind you that you gave me that sketch pad , bella . ”
35779	35793	35817	35817	Dominic	2615	“ I ’m not going over this with you again . Get out . ”
35794	35799	35804	35804	Matteo	1912	“ Oh . Ciao . ”
35849	35852	35853	35853	Dominic	2615	“ Ciao . ”
35893	35901	35889	35889	Matteo	1912	“ A pleasure to see you again . ”
35956	35978	35979	35979	Matteo	1912	“ Well , this has been fun . Glad to see I ’m not the only person you annoy . Bye ! ”
36024	36033	36020	36020	He	2615	“ You really should learn to speak Italian . ”
36045	36057	36036	36036	I	329	“ I will . I mean , I am . Soon . ”
36127	36147	36122	36122	I	329	“ Was there something in particular you wanted ? Because I ’ve got a lot of work to do . ”
36173	36176	36177	36177	he	1912	“ Yes , ”
36184	36199	36177	36177	he	1912	“ There is something I want . And you know exactly what it is . ”
36250	36259	36238	36238	He	1912	“ You know this shop should be mine . ”
36309	36317	36318	36318	I	329	“ This shop will never be yours , ”
36344	36352	36341	36341	I	329	“ Neither will anything else of mine . ”
36360	36365	36357	36357	Matteo	1912	“ We ’ll see . ”
36430	36433	36416	36416	I	329	“ Out . ”
36479	36496	36464	36464	He	2615	“ I wonder what Luca would think to hear the way his daughter speaks to me . ”
36625	36640	36620	36620	I	329	“ Will you please excuse us ? Matteo and I need to talk privately . ”
36662	36675	36676	36676	He	2615	“ I can tell you do n’t like him . Smart girl . ”
36707	36714	36702	36702	I	329	“ I owe you an apology . ”
36784	36802	36812	36812	he	2615	“ For how I talk to you . I ’m normally not this . . . ragey . ”
36815	36827	36812	36812	he	2615	“ You ’re hurting . I ’m just a convenient target . ”
36922	36960	36909	36909	I	329	“ I suppose you ’re right . The sketch pad situation did n’t help , but it was more than a fair trade . That plane ticket is probably the best gift I ’ve ever been given . ”
37008	37013	37014	37014	he	2615	“ I envy you , ”
37045	37051	37052	37052	He	2615	“ What do you mean ? ”
37093	37103	37052	37052	He	2615	“ My father died when I was very young . ”
37135	37150	37104	37104	His	2615	“ At least you knew him . My mother died when I was born . ”
37204	37215	37217	37217	Matteo	398	“ Your father showed me a picture of her once , ”
37241	37249	37217	37217	Matteo	398	“ You look so much like her . ”
37268	37313	37264	37264	I	329	“ I know . I mean , from all the photographs I ’ve seen , we ’re like twins . As I got older , sometimes I ’d catch Papa staring at me with this haunted look , like he was seeing a ghost . ”
37331	37354	37326	37326	he	398	“ Do you think that ’s why the only pictures of you in the house are from when you were a child ? ”
37439	37458	37466	37466	Matteo	398	“ Hair as black as night . Skin as white as snow . Lips as red as blood . ”
37469	37497	37466	37466	Matteo	398	“ That ’s how your father described you . Like Snow White , he said , only too smart to take a poison apple from a witch . ”
37553	37587	37549	37549	my	329	“ If there ’s one thing fairy tales have taught me , it ’s that the most tempting , perfect - looking apples are always the ones that are rotten to the core . ”
37608	37635	37588	37588	He	111	“ Question : How much of your dislike of me is actually about me , and how much of it is about your ex - fiancé ? ”
37703	37713	37692	37692	He	111	“ My ex has nothing to do with anything . ”
37714	37717	37718	37718	His	111	“ Really ? ”
37727	37788	37718	37718	His	111	“ Because I ’m starting to think you decided to hate me before we ever spoke a word to each other . I ’m starting to think that look of disgust you gave me at the airport lounge when you first saw me had nothing to do with me and everything to do with you getting dumped at the altar . ”
37822	37833	37808	37808	my	329	“ I never said I was dumped at the altar . ”
37859	37877	37896	37896	His	329	“ You did n’t have to . There are plenty of stories about it on the internet . ”
37890	37895	37883	37883	I	329	“ You googled me ? ”
37905	37954	37896	37896	His	329	“ I like to know all there is to know about my business rivals . ‘ The Lovelorn Seamstress ’ ? ‘ The Cast - Away Couturier ’ ? So many clever headlines . Maybe you can use one of them for the name of your new shop . ”
38027	38083	38018	38018	I	329	“ Maybe I did decide to hate you before we spoke a word to each other , and maybe I had good reasons . The way you walk around like the world should throw itself at your feet . The way you smirk at everyone , so superior . The way you look at women — ”
38084	38087	38088	38088	he	418	“ You , ”
38095	38106	38088	38088	he	418	“ The way I look at you , you mean . ”
38107	38132	38018	38018	I	329	“ You ’re splitting hairs again . I ’m sure I ’m just one of millions of women you ’ve given that look to . ”
38133	38137	38088	38088	he	418	“ Which look ? ”
38199	38214	38193	38193	his	418	“ You know which look . And step back . You ’re crowding me . ”
38215	38243	38173	38173	His	418	“ No . I want to talk about this look you ’re so upset by . I want you to tell me what you think it means . ”
38277	38286	38287	38287	I	329	“ I do n’t know what it means , ”
38316	38322	38323	38323	he	418	“ Such a terrible liar , ”
38471	38492	38468	38468	Matteo	398	“ I ’d love to be part of whatever conversation you ’re having in your head right now , bella . ”
38510	38531	38506	38506	she	911	“ I was thinking I have a lot of work to do . I was thinking you should leave now . ”
38565	38573	38574	38574	He	398	“ I do n’t accept your apology . ”
38587	38626	38574	38574	He	398	“ I do n’t think it was sincere . I think you should show me how sorry you are for the way you talk to me , bella . And I think you should do it like this . ”
39061	39076	39058	39058	he	398	“ I want to hear you make that sound when I ’m inside you . ”
39188	39215	39180	39180	he	398	“ You see ? We do n’t have to be enemies . Let me buy the business , and we can be the best of friends . ”
39263	39286	39287	39287	He	398	“ Wait . Wait — did you just kiss me to try to get me to sell you my father ’s business ? ”
39315	39320	39300	39300	I	329	“ Answer the question . ”
39353	39368	39321	39321	He	398	“ Oh my God . You . . . you . . . mercenary ! ”
39389	39425	39376	39376	His	398	“ The company will be better off in my hands . If you want to honor your father ’s memory , let someone run it who can make it the success it deserves to be . ”
39488	39517	39455	39455	I	329	“ Fuck you , Matteo Moretti . Fuck you and that high horse you rode in on , and fuck your ego , and fuck your fake kiss . ”
39518	39527	39582	39582	He	398	“ Which you loved , by the way . ”
39528	39538	39539	39539	I	329	“ And fuck that stupid smirk on your face , ”
39555	39581	39539	39539	I	329	“ Now get out of my shop . And do n’t ever come back , or I ’ll make you wish you were never born . ”
39874	39883	39884	39884	I	329	“ Sorry I ’m so late , Loren — ”
39898	39915	39884	39884	I	329	“ Do n’t look so surprised to see me . My mother lives here , remember ? ”
40029	40041	40023	40023	He	926	“ Ah . Signorina . We were just talking about you . ”
40073	40078	40079	40079	I	329	“ Were you now ? ”
40083	40088	40079	40079	I	329	“ Sounds like fun . ”
40124	40133	40114	40114	He	120	“ Can I get you something to eat ? ”
40134	40142	40143	40143	I	329	“ You can get me a gun , ”
40338	40347	40348	40348	I	329	“ Get out of my bed , dog ! ”
40392	40395	40383	40383	I	329	“ Out ! ”
40438	40450	40420	40420	she	574	“ Oh my God . This is a frickin ’ circus . ”
40617	40634	40648	40649	the prick	1912	“ Look who it is . Count Egotistico . Here to give me another fake kiss ? ”
40635	40642	40648	40649	the prick	1912	“ If you ’ll let me . ”
40656	40665	40648	40649	the prick	1912	“ I think I ’ll pass , thanks . ”
40705	40719	40648	40649	the prick	1912	“ You know , hate and love are n’t so different , bella . ”
40747	40762	40648	40649	the prick	1912	“ Why do you enjoy torturing me ? Are you some kind of sadist ? ”
40776	40803	40763	40763	He	1912	“ They ’re two sides of the same coin , really . Passion , obsession , sweaty palms , and a racing heart . Lost sleep . ”
40818	40823	40804	40804	He	1912	“ A poor appetite . ”
40824	40862	40763	40763	He	1912	“ You want a poor appetite ? I ’ll give you a poor appetite . I ’ll take that salami and wedge it so far down your throat you wo n’t be able to eat ever again . ”
40871	40874	40875	40875	he	1912	“ Passion , ”
40893	40900	40901	40901	He	1912	“ Let ’s call a truce . ”
40919	40938	40901	40901	He	1912	“ No truce . No way . And you ’re the one who started this war , remember ? ”
40949	40969	40939	40939	He	1912	“ Yes , you . Wait , why am I even talking to you ? You fake kissed me ! ”
40970	40974	40939	40939	He	1912	“ Did I ? ”
40975	40983	40939	40939	He	1912	“ Yes ! You admitted you did ! ”
40984	40993	40939	40939	He	1912	“ Hmm . I do n’t recall that . ”
40994	41007	40939	40939	He	1912	“ So we ’ll add dementia to your long list of problems . ”
41063	41070	41071	41071	I	329	“ I ’m not a joke , ”
41078	41085	41071	41071	I	329	“ I ’m not a plaything . ”
41086	41093	41071	41071	I	329	“ I never said you were . ”
41141	41162	41137	41137	He	1912	“ You ’re giving me grief about how I look at you ? You should see your eyes right now . ”
41169	41181	41137	41137	He	1912	“ So dirty , bella . So very , very dirty . ”
41182	41203	41137	41137	He	1912	“ I ’m not selling the company , no matter how much you try to sex it out of me . ”
41209	41216	41204	41204	He	1912	“ Sex it out of you ? ”
41234	41244	41224	41224	he	1912	“ Now that sounds interesting . Let ’s discuss . ”
41245	41251	41204	41204	He	1912	“ You ’re a pig . ”
41252	41259	41224	41224	he	1912	“ And yet you want me . ”
41260	41265	41204	41204	He	1912	“ You ’re unbelievable ! ”
41266	41282	41224	41224	he	1912	“ Yes , women have told me that before . Usually right after they come . ”
41305	41313	41299	41299	He	1912	“ What are you doing in here ? ”
41314	41331	41332	41332	He	1912	“ What does it look like I ’m doing ? Trying to get rid of you ! ”
41368	41380	41352	41352	he	1912	“ My darling ex - stepsister . Are you moving in ? ”
41456	41472	41448	41448	He	1912	“ You have the most interesting internal conversations . Are you going to choke me ? ”
41518	41528	41514	41514	he	1912	“ Go ahead . I know you want to . ”
41575	41579	41572	41572	he	1912	“ Those eyes . ”
41589	41596	41572	41572	he	1912	“ What ’s going on here ? ”
41597	41610	41611	41611	Matteo	1912	“ Nothing to worry about , only Kimber trying to strangle me . ”
41666	41678	41679	41680	The marchesa	574	“ Ah . I see you ’re working your usual charm . ”
41686	41709	41679	41680	The marchesa	574	“ If you really want to annoy him , make fun of his hair . He ’s obsessed he might lose it . ”
41743	41751	41727	41727	I	329	“ Did your mother just diss you ? ”
41763	41766	41752	41752	Matteo	1912	“ No . ”
41767	41812	41752	41752	Matteo	1912	“ She totally did ! Oh my God , I need to buy a lottery ticket . Do they have the lottery in this country ? ’Cause this has got to be some kind of sign from the universe that my luck is changing . ”
41828	41844	41824	41824	I	329	“ Aw , whassa matter , Mattie ? Did Mommy hurt widdle Mattie ’s feewings ? ”
41888	41927	41928	41928	He	1912	“ Do I detect a chink in your glossy shining armor , stepbrother dearest ? Have I finally found your Achilles ’ heel ? Mumsy - Wumsy despises you as much as I do , is that it ? ”
41932	41935	41928	41928	He	1912	“ Careful . ”
41954	41963	41928	41928	He	1912	“ Oh . You actually think she does ? ”
42021	42042	42067	42067	I	329	“ Well , this has been real . But it ’s late , and I need to get to bed . ”
42077	42080	42082	42082	Matteo	1912	“ Certo , ”
42124	42149	42110	42110	he	120	“ Since you ’re going to be living in Italy now , I assume you ’ll be attending Fashion Week in Milan next month ? ”
42168	42182	42159	42159	I	329	“ I ’d have to get an invitation . Why do you ask ? ”
42200	42225	42183	42183	He	1912	“ I think you ’ll be interested to see the House of Moretti ’s spring collection . We have some truly incredible new designs . ”
42261	42265	42252	42252	He	1912	“ Sweet dreams . ”
42514	42518	42498	42498	He	948	“ Moshi moshi . ”
42519	42524	42498	42498	He	948	“ Mo — what ? ”
42525	42544	42498	42498	He	948	“ It ’s how they answer the telephone in Japan , darling . Have n’t you been anywhere ? ”
42545	42552	42498	42498	He	948	“ Are you currently in Japan ? ”
42553	42584	42498	42498	He	948	“ Unfortunately , no . But I am currently in bed with a lovely Japanese lad who I was inside of earlier , so it ’s practically the same thing . ”
42585	42602	42498	42498	He	948	“ Oh shit . What time is it there ? I keep forgetting about time zones . ”
42603	42637	42498	42498	He	948	“ Never mind , I ’ve been up all night anyway . How are you ? What ’s happening with my darling love Matteo ? Tell me everything and hurry up about it . ”
42655	42657	42651	42651	I	329	“ please ”
42659	42661	42651	42651	I	329	“ squeeze ”
42666	42693	42498	42498	He	948	“ Ugh . Your ‘ darling love ’ is the worst . We ’re total enemies . I ’m gon na crush him like a bug ! ”
42694	42698	42699	42699	Jenner	418	“ Oh dear . ”
42702	42710	42699	42699	Jenner	418	“ Have you been playing Scrabble again ? ”
42711	42730	42498	42498	He	948	“ No . I ’ve got a bigger game in mind . A game with much higher stakes . ”
42731	42740	42699	42699	Jenner	418	“ Hmm . This sounds interesting . Continue . ”
42753	42765	42741	42741	I	329	“ I ’m gon na crash his show at Fashion Week . ”
42776	42791	42773	42773	Jenner	418	“ It ’s all that Mediterranean sun . It ’s gone to your head . ”
42792	42802	42773	42773	Jenner	418	“ I have n’t been out in the sun ! ”
42803	42836	42773	42773	Jenner	418	“ The wine , then . You ’re having wine for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , right ? They push it on you over there like it ’s Vitamin Water . ”
42837	42843	42773	42773	Jenner	418	“ I ’m completely sober . ”
42844	42847	42848	42848	he	418	“ Wonderful , ”
42852	42866	42848	42848	he	418	“ That means you ’re serious , which means you ’re seriously deluded . ”
42867	42873	42773	42773	Jenner	418	“ I ’m not deluded ! ”
42880	42942	42877	42877	he	418	“ You ’re really starting to worry me , darling . First it was moving to Florence , now it ’s crashing an exclusive invite - only event that will be crawling with security . The next thing I know you ’ll be telling me you want me to model one of your dresses on the catwalk or some such nonsense . ”
42951	42961	42948	42948	Jenner	418	“ Oh no . No , no , no . ”
42962	42975	42948	42948	Jenner	418	“ If you love me , you ’ll do this for me . ”
42976	42982	42948	42948	Jenner	418	“ That ’s emotional blackmail ! ”
42983	43019	42948	42948	Jenner	418	“ I need you , Jenner . Not only are you a professional model — an amazing model — you’re the prettiest person I know . No one has cheekbones or a pout like you . ”
43040	43062	43063	43063	I	329	“ I know how you love making a spectacular entrance , and what I ’ve got planned will be super spectacular . ”
43094	43113	43086	43086	I	329	“ And you ’ll already be in Milan next month for the shows , so it ’s perfect . ”
43117	43127	43114	43114	He	418	“ Oh , Poppins . You ’re delightfully bonkers . ”
43128	43135	43114	43114	He	418	“ So you ’ll do it ? ”
43136	43199	43114	43114	He	418	“ Prance around in one of your daintily exquisite , frothy creations and make an utter fool of myself while simultaneously jeopardizing my career by being involved in an ill - conceived and quite possibly illegal harebrained scheme to disrupt one of the most prestigious fashion shows on the planet ? Of course not . One of us still has his sanity . ”
43203	43211	43200	43200	I	329	“ Danielle would do it for me . ”
43212	43275	43114	43114	He	418	“ Please . No one would let that woman near a catwalk with those enormous boobs of hers . I ’m not even sure they ’d let her in the front door — they’d turn her around and shuttle her off to the nearest Hooters ! Honestly , how you people can walk around with those things , I ’ll never know . ”
43276	43292	43200	43200	I	329	“ I ’ll have you know my boobs are my favorite part of my body . ”
43293	43390	43391	43391	He	950	“ That ’s because you have lovely little B - cups , darling . They ’ll still be perky when you ’re in the old folks ’ home . I can just see you now , shakin ’ your moneymakers for all the drooling old gents in their wheelchairs ! Oh , I can hardly wait . We should pick out your stripper name now so we ’ll be ready . How does it go , the name of your first pet and the street you lived on growing up ? Yes , that ’s it . ”
43396	43404	43391	43391	He	950	“ My stripper name is Frisky Broadmoor ! ”
43437	43458	43547	43547	he	950	“ Getting back to the matter at hand . . . I also need a few of your model friends . ”
43461	43477	43547	43547	he	950	“ Before you say no , you should know that the pay will be great . ”
43512	43538	43547	43547	he	950	“ Okay , not great great , but . . . um . . . actually , how much does a model make per hour ? ”
43539	43546	43547	43547	he	950	“ You ca n’t afford me , ”
43557	43577	43547	43547	he	950	“ Stop batting at it , love , it is n’t a cat toy . Here . Like this . ”
43587	43621	43578	43578	He	952	“ Listen to me now . I know this is a terrible time for you . A terrible , trying time . It ’s normal that you ’re a little off - kilter . ”
43649	43657	43658	43658	he	950	“ I know what you ’re thinking , ”
43667	43673	43658	43658	he	950	“ No you do n’t . ”
43674	43683	43658	43658	he	950	“ You ’re thinking I ’m being patronizing . ”
43693	43737	43738	43738	His	950	“ And maybe you ’re right . For that I apologize . What I ’m trying so poorly to say is that I ’m worried about you , and I ’m here for you for anything that does n’t involve ending my career . ”
43743	43755	43738	43738	His	950	“ Do you want me to fly out for the funeral ? ”
43785	43795	43771	43771	I	329	“ No . Yes . I do n’t know . ”
43796	43812	43738	43738	His	950	“ I can be on a plane in three hours . Just say the word . ”
43832	43835	43836	43836	I	329	“ No , ”
43841	43857	43836	43836	I	329	“ I ’m okay . Thanks for the offer , though . I appreciate it . ”
43888	43929	43930	43930	I	329	“ You know something ? You ’re right . I ’m off - kilter . I ’m not thinking straight . It ’s been a really bizarre , emotional week , and all the wires in my brain are crossed . ”
43947	43969	43940	43940	I	329	“ I ’m gon na go . Sorry for calling you so early . Or late . Whatever it is there . ”

43979	43986	43987	43987	I	329	“ I ’m not Greta Garbo , ”
43990	43996	43987	43987	I	329	“ I ’m Katharine Hepburn . ”
43997	44018	43930	43930	I	329	“ Right . The feisty , independent one , not the moody ‘ I want to be alone ’ one . ”
44019	44022	43987	43987	I	329	“ Exactly . ”
44023	44050	43930	43930	I	329	“ I think you ’re a bit of both , but what I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted is that I love you . ”
44051	44055	44056	44056	I	329	“ I know , ”
44068	44075	44056	44056	I	329	“ I love you , too . ”
44076	44088	43930	43930	I	329	“ Oh , Poppins . It gets better . I promise . ”
44089	44101	44056	44056	I	329	“ You sound like one of those PSAs for teen suicide . ”
44102	44130	43930	43930	I	329	“ Call me anytime you need a pep talk , yes ? And I ’m serious about the funeral . Say the word and I ’m there . ”

44435	44441	44413	44413	I	329	“ I ’m moving in . ”
44464	44476	44442	44442	She	964	“ I assumed that when Dominic brought your luggage back yesterday . ”
44548	44566	44571	44571	her	964	“ I took my room back . Cornelia will have to share with Beans from now on . ”
44594	44603	44604	44605	The marchesa	124	“ I ’m sure we ’ll make do . ”
44629	44637	44626	44626	I	329	“ Okay , then . Great talk . ”

45196	45205	45208	45208	he	398	“ Oh ? Is that what I need ? ”
45262	45281	45233	45233	he	398	“ I do n’t want to have to deal with you every time I get home from work . ”
45282	45300	45302	45302	his	398	“ Deal with me ? Interesting choice of words . Brings to mind some kind of punishment . ”
45331	45372	45312	45312	I	329	“ I do n’t want you here , all right ? Is that clear enough for you ? I do n’t like you , I do n’t trust you , and I want you to stay out of my house . ”
45394	45400	45390	45391	his mother	707	“ Perhaps we can negotiate . ”

45530	45552	45522	45522	Matteo	398	“ But I suppose if you ’re not interested in getting your sketch pad back , we can forget about it . ”
45570	45601	45556	45556	My	329	“ You already said you ’re using my designs in your new collection , so it does n’t make a difference if I get the sketch pad back or not . ”
45602	45609	45610	45610	His	398	“ Is that what I said ? ”
45652	45662	45663	45663	I	329	“ I ’m not playing this game with you , ”
45673	45733	45663	45663	I	329	“ I ’ve had enough of your bullshit . I want you to get the hell out of my house and stay out . If you do n’t , I ’ll call the police . I own this property . Not your mother , me . If I do n’t want you here , that means you ’re trespassing . ”
45757	45768	45754	45754	he	398	“ Do you have any idea how beautiful you are ? ”

45869	45876	45877	45877	He	398	“ I ’ll tell you what . ”
45924	45943	45900	45900	He	398	“ If you decide you ’d like to hear my offer , here ’s my number . If you don’t”—he

46016	46032	46010	46010	he	398	“ For the record , it was n’t a compliment . It was a question . ”
46038	46055	46010	46010	he	398	“ When are you going to do us all a favor and jump off a building ? ”
46192	46197	46188	46188	I	329	“ Yo , dog . ”

47189	47212	47213	47213	Her	1929	“ I ’m too broad in the shoulders , and my waist has n’t been that small since before Matteo was born . ”
47228	47287	47213	47213	Her	1929	“ After she died , I donated all her clothing to the haute couture exhibition at the Palais Galliera . She had the most incredible collection . Practically priceless , by today ’s standards . This one I kept because the one time she wore it was the only time in my life I ever saw her cry . ”
47295	47323	47288	47288	Her	1929	“ She hated to show emotions . She said it was undignified . Weak . Whenever I cried as a child , I ’d get a beating . ”

50767	50777	50787	50787	He	398	“ You could ’ve just written me a letter . ”
50778	50786	50787	50787	He	398	“ You would ’ve torn it up . ”

51185	51193	51175	51175	Brad	418	“ What do you mean , yes ? ”
51194	51200	51201	51201	He	398	“ I mean . . . ”
51228	51302	51175	51175	Brad	418	“ I mean yes . I did all that . I slept around with women because I was desperate no one would know . I said those things about Jenner and his boyfriends and made up those stories about all the sex I had in college and did pretty much anything else I could think of — everything I could think of — so I would n’t have to admit it to myself . ”
51327	51342	51324	51324	he	398	“ But mostly so I would n’t have to admit it to my father . ”
51426	51435	51436	51436	I	329	“ But nobody stays in the closet anymore , ”
51445	51495	51436	51436	I	329	“ I ’m no expert , but , I mean . . . do they ? He ’s a grown man . . . a grown man who lives in San Francisco , the LGBTQ capital of the universe . Why on earth would he pretend to be straight ? ”
51496	51506	51507	51507	Brad	418	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry ! ”
51513	51521	51507	51507	Brad	418	“ I never meant to hurt you ! ”
51522	51534	51535	51535	I	329	“ Oh , well , good job with that , Wingate . ”
51594	51645	51646	51646	He	329	“ If anyone should be bawling here , it should be me , asshole . Do you have any idea how much you hurt me ? How what you did absolutely devastated me ? How I will never , ever get over that shit for the rest of my life ? ”
51667	51670	51671	51671	I	329	“ Okay . ”
51676	51689	51671	51671	I	329	“ Hey , calm down , it ’s gon na be okay . ”
51805	51812	51813	51813	I	329	“ I buried my father today . ”
51834	51842	51843	51843	Brad	418	“ God , I ’m so sorry . ”
51867	51877	51851	51851	He	329	“ I know how much he meant to you . ”
51909	51933	51903	51903	I	329	“ I spent three years of my life with you . Three years . You ’re telling me it was all a lie ? ”
51934	51943	51944	51944	He	329	“ No , no , it was n’t . ”
51958	51986	51944	51944	He	329	“ I loved you ! I did ! I do . You ’re my best friend . You ’re the only person I ever felt safe with . ”
52028	52139	52008	52008	He	329	“ I do n’t understand . You could ’ve told me at the beginning . I would ’ve supported you . You did n’t have to steal three years of my life . Because if what you ’re telling me is true , that ’s what you did . You stole three years of my life because you were too much of a coward to live yours . I can never get that time back . All that time and all that love I gave you . . . and you repaid it with disloyalty and public humiliation . And now you ’re here to what ? Ask my forgiveness ? ”
52161	52165	52166	52166	he	1078	“ I know , ”
52170	52178	52166	52166	he	1078	“ It ’s unforgiveable , I know . ”
52280	52305	52306	52306	He	1078	“ How could you have sex with me ? Did you have to imagine I had a dick so you could get it up ? ”
52309	52317	52306	52306	He	1078	“ No , I just . . . ”
52350	52380	52335	52335	he	1078	“ It was n’t hard to be with you . You ’re pretty . And you always smell good . And you ’re a really good kisser . . . ”
52416	52434	52411	52411	I	329	“ Please tell me you used protection . All these other people you were having sex with — ”
52435	52444	52456	52456	he	1078	“ I was always safe , I swear . ”
52618	52639	52614	52614	he	1078	“ Stay away from me . I do n’t ever want to see your face again , do you understand ? ”
52640	52649	52614	52614	he	1078	“ Please , Kimber , listen to me — ”
52650	52708	52614	52614	he	1078	“ I do n’t ever want to hear your voice . I do n’t care what you have to say . Nothing can make it better . Nothing can undo what you ’ve done . Stay the hell away from me , Bradley , or so help me God I wo n’t be responsible for my actions . ”
52740	52748	52735	52735	Brad	418	“ I still want to marry you ! ”
52784	52806	52773	52773	He	329	“ You can have the life you always wanted . I ’ll give you anything you want , babe , anything . ”
52807	52812	52813	52813	I	329	“ Are you insane ? ”
52816	52833	52813	52813	I	329	“ What the hell are you talking about ? You just told me you ’re gay ! ”
52846	52883	52841	52841	him	329	“ You ’re the only person I ’ve told . No one else has to know ! We could have it all — think about it ! The house , the lifestyle , all the money ! ”
52902	52914	52892	52892	I	329	“ You ’re suggesting we pretend to be a real couple ? ”
52924	52961	52915	52915	He	329	“ We ’d be rich . And you could do whatever you wanted . You could expand your shop , travel , whatever . Think of the life we ’d have . Think of the possibilities . ”
52974	53037	52966	52966	His	329	“ I never told you this , but the trust my father set up for me when I was born stipulates I get a lump sum of five million when I marry . You can have it all to do whatever you want with . Think of it , babe — five million dollars . Think how that could change your life . ”
53065	53074	53062	53062	I	329	“ I see you ’ve thought this through . ”
53089	53113	53075	53075	He	329	“ We ’d still be best friends . We ’d still live together . We ’d do everything together , except . . . ”
53114	53131	53132	53132	He	329	“ Except the one thing married people are supposed to do together . Namely , fuck . ”
53143	53157	53132	53132	He	329	“ I mean , you could have as many boyfriends as you wanted . ”
53233	53254	53255	53255	I	329	“ I took it easy on you this time because it looks like that nose of yours is still healing , ”
53262	53295	53255	53255	I	329	“ But so help me God , one more word out of you and I ’ll knock all your teeth out . And by the way , I ’m not a prostitute ! ”
53296	53303	53212	53212	Crack	201	“ I never said you were ! ”
53304	53326	53255	53255	I	329	“ You already left me at the altar ! You think I ’m crazy enough to sign up for that twice ? ”
53327	53349	53212	53212	Crack	201	“ I panicked ! I swear it would n’t happen again ! Now that you know , everything could be different ! ”
53361	53394	53350	53350	My	329	“ You know , you almost had me . I felt sorry for you there for a minute . But now I just feel like ripping your intestines out through your nose . ”
53444	53450	53451	53451	she	1087	“ Get me a drink , ”
53728	53731	53712	53712	She	1929	“ Another . ”
53794	53817	53791	53791	she	1929	“ He wants me to go back to San Francisco and marry him . He still wants me to be his wife . ”
53834	53841	53818	53818	She	1929	“ What did you tell him ? ”
53877	53888	53913	53913	she	1929	“ I ’ll hurt him if you want me to . ”
53889	53897	53913	53913	she	1929	“ Yes , I want you to . ”
53928	53937	53938	53938	she	1929	“ You really would , would n’t you ? ”
53965	53969	53962	53962	I	329	“ With pleasure . ”
54006	54009	54010	54010	She	1929	“ Sit . ”
54085	54094	54082	54082	She	1929	“ I have to get out of here . ”
54116	54119	54113	54113	she	1929	“ Please , ”
54139	54147	54148	54148	I	329	“ Where do you want to go ? ”
54152	54162	54148	54148	I	329	“ Anywhere . Just . . . anywhere else . ”
54211	54220	54221	54221	I	329	“ You ’re going to be all right , ”
54224	54229	54221	54221	I	329	“ Look at me . ”
54253	54257	54250	54250	I	329	“ I promise . ”
54315	54336	54307	54307	she	1929	“ You men and your promises . By the way , how ’s that new collection of yours coming along ? ”
54793	54873	54789	54789	I	329	“ I always wanted to be married . When I was a little girl , I dreamed of how it would be . The flowers . The music . My wedding gown . I had this fantasy built up in my head of this perfect , beautiful day . . . and the perfect , beautiful man I ’d marry . He ’d be so in love with me , he ’d die just for a kiss . . . ”
54946	54952	54943	54943	I	329	“ I ’m so ashamed . ”
54953	54959	54936	54936	I	329	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
54965	54974	54943	54943	I	329	“ You have nothing to be ashamed of . ”
54994	55011	54985	54985	I	329	“ Stupid to trust . Stupid to dream . Stupid to believe in the fairy tale . ”
55012	55021	55022	55022	Matteo	398	“ I could kill him just for this , ”
55031	55038	55022	55022	Matteo	398	“ Just for making you cry . ”
55057	55070	55039	55039	He	398	“ I heard your mother crying . Behind her closed bedroom door . ”
55079	55087	55071	55071	His	398	“ Did you think she would n’t ? ”
55236	55242	55233	55233	I	329	“ What is this place ? ”
55243	55248	55261	55261	He	329	“ Castello di Moretti . ”
55270	55275	55261	55261	He	329	“ Home sweet home . ”
55287	55292	55276	55276	He	329	“ You live here ? ”
55293	55315	55261	55261	He	329	“ I grew up here . This has been the seat of the Moretti family for more than eight hundred years . ”
55316	55321	55322	55322	I	329	“ Uh - huh . ”
55327	55337	55261	55261	He	329	“ Why are you looking at me like that ? ”
55345	55351	55338	55338	I	329	“ This explains a lot . ”
55419	55422	55423	55423	Matteo	398	“ Come , ”
55427	55443	55444	55444	He	329	“ There are many old , priceless objects inside you ’ll no doubt enjoy breaking . ”
55587	55591	55592	55592	I	329	“ Total shithole , ”
55704	55710	55711	55711	I	329	“ You grew up here ? ”
55764	55774	55781	55781	his	329	“ When I was n’t away at boarding school . ”
55945	55949	55942	55942	they	1134	“ Mio signore . ”
55964	55968	55960	55960	they	1134	“ My lord . ”
56033	56043	56030	56030	I	329	“ Where are you taking me , my lord ? ”
56104	56161	56100	56100	He	398	“ If it were up to me , I ’d be taking you to bed and putting that mouth of yours to good use . Now I can see why your attitude is so bad — there ’s no way in hell that boy you were going to marry could ever satisfy a woman like you . ”
56286	56294	56299	56299	my	329	“ You think you can do better ? ”
56393	56396	56397	56397	he	398	“ Bella , ”
56400	56406	56397	56397	he	398	“ You know I can . ”
56480	56485	56477	56477	He	398	“ Do n’t you ? ”
56656	56661	56634	56634	He	398	“ Do n’t you . ”
56782	56785	56778	56778	he	398	“ Kimber . ”
56800	56803	56797	56797	I	329	“ Yes , ”
56975	56980	56972	56972	he	398	“ Sei cosí dolce . ”
57015	57026	57051	57053	dear sweet lord	1144	“ Voglio mettere la mia faccia tra le tue gambe . ”
57027	57040	57051	57053	dear sweet lord	1144	“ Are you . . . are you talking dirty to me ? ”
57183	57191	57192	57192	he	398	“ I want to suck on this , ”
57209	57243	57192	57192	he	398	“ I want to pinch it and suck on it and lick it . I want to test it with my teeth , see how much pressure you can take before you squirm . ”
57290	57363	57287	57287	he	398	“ I want to take off all your clothes and get you naked underneath me , spread you out on a bed so I can see all that beautiful skin . I want to put my face between your legs and eat your sweet pussy until you ’re hoarse from screaming and limp from coming . Then I want to slide my hard cock deep inside you and fuck you , bella . ”
57396	57422	57391	57391	His	398	“ I want to fuck you until you forget everyone and everything else but me . Until you ’re satisfied . Until you ’re mine . ”
57458	57463	57439	57439	our	1146	“ Wait — wait . ”
57493	57500	57484	57484	I	329	“ You ’re using my designs . ”
57517	57520	57501	57501	He	398	“ What ? ”
57521	57541	57501	57501	He	398	“ My designs . From my sketch pad . You ’re using them in your new collection . Right ? ”
57567	57570	57564	57564	he	398	“ Yes . ”
57598	57609	57610	57610	He	398	“ I do n’t want you to . Do n’t . ”
57622	57627	57616	57616	his	398	“ Are we negotiating ? ”
57644	57668	57637	57637	I	329	“ You know , you have to go to sleep at some point . But you do n’t necessarily have to wake up . ”
57677	57698	57669	57669	He	398	“ Here ’s my offer you did n’t want to hear earlier : a kiss for every page I return . ”
57714	57733	57711	57711	he	398	“ Not a peck on the cheek , either . A kiss like the one we just shared . ”
57777	57808	57774	57774	I	329	“ When I ’m telling my best friend the story of the exact moment I went from disliking you and distrusting you to hating you , this will be it . ”
57838	57904	57834	57834	He	398	“ There are twenty - six designs in that sketch pad . I ’ll give you credit for the kiss we just had , plus the kiss at your father ’s shop . That leaves twenty - four . I ’ll leave it up to you when we start , but we ’ll have to be done by the night before the shows in Milan . ”
57914	57920	57905	57905	I	329	“ That ’s three weeks . ”
57928	57933	57924	57924	his	398	“ Better get started . ”
57958	57981	57945	57945	I	329	“ I ’ll tell everyone . I ’ll make sure everyone knows those designs are mine . I ’ll call the press — ”
57982	57990	57991	57991	His	398	“ Really ? You want more press ? ”
58027	58040	58055	58055	He	398	“ It does n’t matter . I can prove they ’re mine . ”
58041	58052	58055	58055	He	398	“ How ? Your name is nowhere on that pad . ”
58079	58094	58095	58095	He	398	“ And you did n’t sign any of the sketches , so . . . ”
58113	58139	58108	58108	I	329	“ I have copies of everything . In San Francisco . On my computer . I always make copies of what I ’m working on . ”
58156	58174	58149	58149	his	398	“ One of these days you ’ll learn how to lie convincingly . Today is n’t it . ”
58223	58249	58261	58261	His	398	“ I said I ’d pay you back for the ticket , and I meant it . Once the shop is back on its feet — ”
58250	58260	58261	58261	His	398	“ I do n’t want your money , bella . ”
58295	58322	58289	58289	I	329	“ You do n’t need my designs . Your company is the hottest thing going . Your menswear line alone is one of the most profitable — ”
58323	58334	58289	58289	I	329	“ We ’re expanding the ladies ’ evening wear line . ”
58387	58396	58384	58384	I	329	“ My father would hate you for this . ”
58424	58443	58419	58419	he	398	“ No . Your father would be disappointed that you ’re trying to go back on your word . ”
58473	58489	58462	58462	He	398	“ We made a trade . A fair trade . One you agreed to freely . ”
58495	58514	58462	58462	He	398	“ A trade you admitted was the best gift you ’ve ever been given , if you recall . ”
58831	58850	58821	58821	she	1160	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . I do n’t , um . . . no comprende Italiano . ”
58998	59005	58994	58994	she	1161	“ Um . . . Chianti ? ”
59113	59118	59119	59119	Sicurezza	211	“ Stanza di sicurezza . ”
59169	59173	59180	59180	Matteo	398	“ Moshi moshi . ”
59188	59197	59180	59180	Matteo	398	“ I see you ’ve been to Japan . ”
59225	59277	59211	59211	He	398	“ I ’m sorry , Matteo is n’t available at the moment . He ’s busy being a horrible human being . If you want to catch him when he ’s not being a massive asshole , you ’ll have to call back when pigs fly and hell has frozen over . ”
59278	59298	59180	59180	Matteo	398	“ You should try the chair next to the fireplace . It ’s a more appropriate size for you . ”
59313	59318	59299	59299	I	329	“ Where are you ? ”
59319	59333	59211	59211	He	398	“ In the security room . Looking at you on a video screen . ”
59464	59467	59457	59457	I	329	“ What ? ”
59478	59485	59475	59475	he	398	“ I hate seeing you unhappy . ”
59486	59498	59475	59475	he	398	“ Are you bipolar ? Is that the root issue here ? ”
59499	59515	59475	59475	he	398	“ No . I ’m telling you the truth — I hate seeing you unhappy . ”
59516	59554	59475	59475	he	398	“ You can repeat that until the cows come home , but it does n’t change the fact that you ’re perfectly willing to be the source of my unhappiness . One of the sources , anyway . ”
59568	59577	59565	59565	he	398	“ Where do you think that saying originated ? ”
59585	59588	59580	59580	I	329	“ What ? ”
59589	59596	59565	59565	he	398	“ Until the cows come home . ”
59608	59623	59597	59597	I	329	“ Being around you is enough to drive anyone insane , you know that ? ”
59630	59638	59624	59624	His	398	“ I know . I ’m sorry . ”
59639	59642	59643	59643	I	329	“ Seriously ? ”
59653	59659	59643	59643	I	329	“ Stop it , then ! ”
59660	59665	59705	59705	She	1161	“ I ca n’t . ”
59725	59728	59755	59755	she	1161	“ Ecco . ”
59729	59737	59755	59755	she	1161	“ Thank you . Um , grazie . ”
59794	59801	59791	59791	she	1161	“ But he ’s worth it . ”
60163	60169	60160	60160	he	398	“ How do you feel ? ”
60170	60177	60178	60178	He	398	“ Like shit . What happened ? ”
60197	60217	60178	60178	He	398	“ You drank an entire bottle of wine in under thirty minutes , then passed out . Take these . ”
60239	60242	60231	60231	he	398	“ Drink . ”
60272	60275	60276	60276	I	329	“ Bossy , ”
60443	60447	60460	60460	He	398	“ Feel good ? ”
60448	60453	60454	60454	I	329	“ I hate you , ”
60464	60468	60460	60460	He	398	“ I know . ”
60517	60524	60559	60559	he	398	“ How did I get here ? ”
60525	60530	60559	60559	he	398	“ I carried you . ”
60556	60558	60559	60559	he	398	“ carried ”
60561	60564	60559	60559	he	398	“ dragged . ”
60592	60598	60626	60627	my God	1857	“ Is this your bed ? ”
60612	60624	60599	60599	He	398	“ I ’ll say no if it makes you feel better . ”
60720	60726	60727	60727	he	398	“ Do n’t freak out , ”
60736	60773	60727	60727	he	398	“ I do n’t take advantage of incapacitated women . I just need to rest my eyes for a minute . I was up most of the night watching to make sure you were n’t dying . ”
60866	60874	60856	60856	My	329	“ Bella . You think too much . ”
60875	60886	60921	60921	His	398	“ I ’m trying to decide how weird this is . ”
60887	60899	60856	60856	My	329	“ On a scale of one to ten , you mean ? ”
60900	60903	60921	60921	His	398	“ Yeah . ”
60904	60907	60908	60908	he	398	“ Zero , ”
60912	60920	60921	60921	His	398	“ But I ’m mad at you . ”
60943	60958	60921	60921	His	398	“ You ’re not mad . You ’re hurt . There ’s a difference . ”
60959	60970	60921	60921	His	398	“ Believe me , Count Egotistico , I ’m mad . ”
60994	61006	60990	60990	he	398	“ It ’s all going to work out . I promise . ”
61007	61037	60990	60990	he	398	“ Do n’t ever say the P word to me again . The next man who says the P word to me is gon na get a major beatdown . ”
61038	61042	61043	61043	he	398	“ So violent , ”
61055	61066	60990	60990	he	398	“ You should believe me . I ’m super scary . ”
61067	61082	61083	61083	His	398	“ Oh I know . I saw what you did to blondie ’s face . ”
61087	61093	61083	61083	His	398	“ It ’s an improvement . ”
61237	61251	61218	61218	My	329	“ That was a very sad - sounding sigh . Care to share ? ”
61294	61307	61282	61282	I	329	“ So this offer of yours about getting my sketch pad back . ”
61399	61404	61396	61396	he	398	“ What about it ? ”
61441	61464	61436	61436	I	329	“ How do I know you wo n’t use the designs even if I do agree to your . . . terms ? ”
61494	61505	61436	61436	I	329	“ I ’ll give you a page back every time . ”
61525	61535	61512	61512	him	398	“ You could ’ve already made copies of everything . ”
61536	61563	61506	61506	I	329	“ I have n’t . And I wo n’t . And I ’ll destroy any dress we ’ve made when I give you its sketch back . ”
61569	61577	61564	61564	I	329	“ I ’m supposed to believe that ? ”
61578	61592	61564	61564	I	329	“ Short of saying the P word , how can I convince you ? ”
61651	61659	61649	61649	me	329	“ I ’ll tell your mother everything . ”
61662	61671	61679	61679	He	398	“ She might not believe me , but — ”
61672	61678	61679	61679	He	398	“ She ’ll believe you . ”
61770	61781	61767	61767	I	329	“ You ’ve blackmailed other designers before me , hmm ? ”
61782	61797	61767	61767	I	329	“ No . She just does n’t expect me to be anything but disappointing . ”
62021	62027	62048	62048	Matteo	398	“ What are you thinking ? ”
62036	62042	62028	62028	My	329	“ About becoming a lesbian . ”
62051	62059	62048	62048	Matteo	398	“ You ’d make a terrible lesbian . ”
62060	62070	62048	62048	Matteo	398	“ I think I ’d make a great lesbian ! ”
62071	62078	62048	62048	Matteo	398	“ You like dick too much . ”
62085	62100	62079	62079	My	329	“ I do n’t like dick any more or less than the next girl . ”
62117	62133	62110	62110	he	329	“ Yes , you do . You just have n’t ridden the right dick yet . ”
62217	62224	62175	62175	He	329	“ You ’re an awful person . ”
62225	62232	62175	62175	He	329	“ And yet you want me . ”
62233	62260	62175	62175	He	329	“ We ’re back to that line ? Your ego has its own atmosphere , you know that ? God , I wish vanity were painful . ”
62261	62274	62175	62175	He	329	“ I ’m not vain , I ’m merely stating the facts . ”
62275	62290	62175	62175	He	329	“ Please stop talking now . You ’re making me want to commit murder . ”
62303	62323	62291	62291	His	329	“ Remember what I told you about love and hate , bella . Two sides of the same coin . ”
62383	62397	62420	62420	He	329	“ Do n’t you have to go to work ? It ’s Monday . ”
62398	62415	62420	62420	He	329	“ I will . Eventually . Right now I ’ve got more important things to do . ”
62416	62419	62420	62420	He	329	“ Hmpf . ”
62423	62429	62420	62420	He	329	“ Go back to sleep . ”
62430	62435	62420	62420	He	329	“ Like I could . ”
62436	62440	62420	62420	He	329	“ Why not ? ”
62441	62457	62420	62420	He	329	“ Gee , let ’s see . We ’re in your bed , for starters . ”
62458	62469	62470	62470	Pregnant	217	“ Fully clothed . Which is how we ’ll stay . ”
62473	62482	62470	62470	Pregnant	217	“ Unless you ’re planning on undressing me . ”
62483	62487	62420	62420	He	329	“ Shut up . ”
62512	62552	62562	62562	his	329	“ At least let the aspirin get to work . When you feel better , I ’ll drive you home . Then , later on or tomorrow , you can let me know what you decide about my offer . ”
62751	62761	62762	62762	His	329	“ Forget it . You ’re not sneaking off . ”
62778	62787	62771	62771	He	329	“ I have to go to the bathroom . ”
62798	62805	62771	62771	He	329	“ Like . . . bad . ”
62822	62840	62806	62806	He	329	“ If you ’re not back in three minutes , I ’m coming to look for you . ”
62841	62844	62845	62845	I	329	“ Irritating , ”
63159	63164	63166	63166	Matteo	398	“ You ’re staring , ”
63227	63232	63224	63224	I	329	“ Nuh - uh . ”
63237	63243	63244	63244	He	398	“ Oh . My mistake . ”
63354	63368	63343	63343	His	398	“ Not a word , Moretti , unless you want a black eye . ”
63468	63474	63475	63475	I	329	“ I ’ll walk home , ”
63487	63501	63475	63475	I	329	“ It would take hours . And you do n’t know the way . ”
63502	63509	63510	63510	I	329	“ I ’ll call a taxi , ”
63529	63538	63475	63475	I	329	“ Your shoes are next to the bed . ”
63583	63598	63578	63578	He	398	“ How are you going to get a taxi without a phone or money ? ”
63610	63620	63607	63607	he	398	“ You did n’t bring your purse with you . ”
63621	63631	63652	63652	I	329	“ You ’re enjoying yourself , are n’t you ? ”
63632	63644	63607	63607	he	398	“ Just wait there a minute . I ’ll drive you . ”
63732	63736	63737	63737	he	398	“ Those eyes , ”
64404	64407	64399	64399	I	329	“ Hello ? ”
64408	64415	64442	64442	He	120	“ Please do n’t hang up . ”
64430	64441	64421	64421	my	329	“ You have a death wish , do n’t you ? ”
64457	64469	64442	64442	He	120	“ Five million cash plus the deed to the new house . ”
64470	64488	64442	64442	He	120	“ In exchange for my soul and what ’s left of my self - respect ? No . ”
64489	64523	64442	64442	He	120	“ I ’ll throw in the apartment . The lease is up at the end of the month , but I ’ll keep paying it . You could use it as a studio . ”
64524	64542	64442	64442	He	120	“ Or you could buy me a studio on Fillmore in Pacific Heights like I always wanted . ”
64548	64558	64543	64543	His	120	“ Yes ! Totally ! You pick the place ! ”
64567	64575	64559	64559	I	329	“ That was a joke , dumbass . ”
64576	64581	64582	64582	He	120	“ Oh . Okay . ”
64590	64608	64559	64559	I	329	“ Where are you calling me from ? I want to make sure I block the number . ”
64609	64638	64559	64559	I	329	“ I ’m staying at a hotel downtown . And I ’m gon na stay here until I can figure out how to make it up to you . ”
64677	64688	64639	64639	I	329	“ Here ’s an idea : light yourself on fire . ”
64706	64712	64700	64700	I	329	“ That was another joke ! ”
64716	64721	64700	64700	I	329	“ Oh . Okay . ”
64722	64731	64738	64738	he	120	“ What the hell is wrong with you ? ”
64741	64763	64738	64738	he	120	“ I ’m lost without you . I did n’t realize how much you meant to me until you were gone . ”
64777	64793	64764	64764	I	329	“ Boo - frickin’-hoo , dickface ! And by the way , you ’re gay ! ”
64818	64841	64801	64801	Brad	418	“ Yeah . It ’s been really hard hiding it from everyone . I feel a lot better since I told you . ”
64846	64865	64842	64842	My	329	“ I swear to God , dude , I’mma cut a bitch if you keep this shit up . ”
64866	64910	64801	64801	Brad	418	“ It ’s the truth ! I ’ve known since I was like six or something , but you know how my dad ’s always going on about family values and homosexuality being from the devil and , y’know , all that stuff . ”
64929	64931	64918	64919	Senator Wingate	70	“ progressives ”
64934	64936	64998	64998	He	1239	“ backward ”
64952	64997	64998	64998	He	1239	“ There are plenty of people with judgmental assholes for parents who do n’t go to the trouble of ruining an innocent person ’s life because they ’re too scared to stand up to Mommy and Daddy and live the life they really want . ”
65001	65005	64998	64998	He	1239	“ I know . ”
65020	65038	65015	65015	I	329	“ If you really want to make it up to me , come out to your parents . ”
65044	65056	65039	65039	His	1239	“ No . . . no , what I ’m saying — ”
65057	65166	65167	65167	My	329	“ I hear what you ’re saying . You need to hear what I ’m saying : It ’s not gon na happen . I ’m not gon na be your beard . I need love , Brad . Real love . A life to share and a strong shoulder to lean on , someone to build a future with . Have a family with . Grow old with . I wanted all that with you but you robbed me . And the really shitty part , the thing I just ca n’t get over , is that you made me believe you wanted it all , too . ”
65171	65186	65167	65167	My	329	“ You made me believe you loved me as much as I loved you . ”
65187	65193	65194	65194	he	329	“ I do love you , ”
65198	65204	65194	65194	he	329	“ I swear I do . ”
65205	65221	65167	65167	My	329	“ Even if you do , it ’s not the same and you know it . ”
65277	65284	65268	65268	he	329	“ So who ’s the hottie ? ”
65285	65288	65268	65268	he	329	“ What ? ”
65289	65311	65268	65268	he	329	“ The dark - haired guy you were with yesterday with the amazing blue eyes who looks like a supermodel assassin . ”
65363	65399	65352	65352	he	329	“ Give me a break ! You only told me yesterday that you ’re gay ! We ’re not at the point where we ’re going to start talking about how hot other guys are ! ”
65400	65405	65406	65406	He	329	“ Right . Sorry . ”
65417	65423	65406	65406	He	329	“ But who is he ? ”
65430	65446	65352	65352	he	329	“ Not that it ’s any of your business , but he ’s my stepbrother . ”
65447	65452	65352	65352	he	329	“ Is he single ? ”
65453	65468	65352	65352	he	329	“ I ’m gon na pretend I did n’t hear that , you moron . ”
65469	65491	65492	65492	He	329	“ It ’s just that he ’s probably the best - looking man I ’ve ever seen . And so intense . ”
65498	65516	65492	65492	He	329	“ You have no idea how good it feels to be able to say that out loud . ”
65532	65540	65517	65517	I	329	“ Can we please be done sharing ? ”
65541	65551	65352	65352	he	329	“ Hold on — stepbrother ? Your dad remarried ? ”
65552	65576	65517	65517	I	329	“ Oh ho ! Welcome to the conversation ! Jesus , it ’s like you have selective hearing . Yes , he remarried . ”
65577	65585	65352	65352	he	329	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
65586	65634	65517	65517	I	329	“ Because I did n’t know . From what I ’m told , it was all hush - hush because my father did n’t want to take any attention away from our wedding . He was planning on telling me after we got back from the honeymoon . ”
65635	65642	65352	65352	he	329	“ That makes no sense whatsoever . ”
65643	65651	65517	65517	I	329	“ Finally something on which we agree . ”
65684	65692	65352	65352	he	329	“ So what ’s his wife like ? ”
65693	65726	65352	65352	he	329	“ If Nurse Ratched and the iceberg that sank the Titanic had a love child , it would be her . She was the blonde yesterday who said you should be shot . ”
65727	65747	65352	65352	he	329	“ Yikes . I ’m surprised your dad would ’ve married someone like that . He seemed so nice . ”
65789	65803	65787	65787	kaput	227	“ I guess falling in love with terrible people runs in the family . ”
65814	65824	65804	65804	He	310	“ I ’m not terrible ! I ’m just — ”
65825	65834	65787	65787	kaput	227	“ Selfish ? Immature ? Cowardly ? Shallow ? ”
65854	65863	65849	65849	he	310	“ Yeah . I suppose I am terrible . ”
65864	65875	65804	65804	He	310	“ So what ’re you gon na do about it ? ”
65876	65882	65849	65849	he	310	“ I need your help ! ”
65883	65906	65804	65804	He	310	“ Unless it ’s for castration , count me out . You ’re a big boy . Fix your own damn self . ”
65907	65912	65849	65849	he	310	“ How about this — ”
65913	65916	65804	65804	He	310	“ No . ”
65942	66010	65939	65939	he	310	“ I ’m sorry . I know I messed up . I know I hurt you . I just got caught up in the whole thing . The planning , your excitement , my parents ’ excitement . I was so happy that everyone else was happy , but then it felt like I was riding a speeding train and there was no way to get off . ”
66011	66024	66025	66025	I	329	“ You could ’ve jumped and saved everyone a lot of trouble , ”
66032	66054	66025	66025	I	329	“ If I could go back and change it , believe me , I would . I ’d do everything differently . ”
66072	66092	66093	66093	He	1246	“ Please , if there ’s anything I can do for you , I will . I . . . ”
66112	66154	66101	66101	he	1246	“ I do care about you . I do love you , in my way . More than anything in the world , I wanted to be what you wanted . I never thought anyone would ever want me for myself . ”
66226	66273	66211	66211	she	1249	“ Look . If you really want to do something for me , have all my stuff at the apartment packed up and put it into storage . I ’m not gon na be back in time to get that done before the lease is up . ”
66274	66280	66211	66211	she	1249	“ Done . What else ? ”
66281	66288	66211	66211	she	1249	“ Come out to your parents . ”
66300	66305	66289	66289	He	1246	“ I ca n’t ! ”
66306	66357	66211	66211	she	1249	“ So what ’s your plan , then , genius ? Troll some other stupid girl into falling in love with you so you can keep up this charade of being someone you ’re not ? Because if I find out you do that , I ’ll out you myself . ”
66374	66379	66367	66367	he	1246	“ You would n’t . ”
66380	66384	66367	66367	he	1246	“ Try me . ”
66385	66388	66367	66367	he	1246	“ Kimber ! ”
66397	66434	66389	66389	He	1246	“ You ’re lucky I wo n’t do it anyway , you putz . I do n’t believe in revenge , but I wo n’t let you do to anyone else what you did to me . ”
66435	66458	66367	66367	he	1246	“ But if I do n’t marry , my father will cut me off ! Where am I gon na get money ? ”
66459	66470	66389	66389	He	1246	“ Try getting a job like the rest of us ! ”
66471	66491	66367	66367	he	1246	“ Doing what ? You know the only things I ’m good at are working out and planning vacations . ”
66540	66564	66389	66389	He	1246	“ You ’re good at mixing cocktails and chatting up strangers , too . You could get a job on a cruise ship . ”
66565	66568	66389	66389	He	1246	“ Ha . ”
66569	66584	66389	66389	He	1246	“ I have a solution , but you ’re not going to like it . ”
66589	66594	66585	66585	He	329	“ What is it ? ”
66595	66600	66389	66389	He	1246	“ Marry a dude . ”
66604	66607	66601	66601	He	329	“ Please . ”
66608	66663	66389	66389	He	1246	“ I ’m serious . Ask your attorney what that trust actually says . Get a copy of it and read it . I ’ll bet your father did n’t put anything in there that stipulates you have to marry a woman . The thought never would have even occurred to Mr. Family Values . ”
66680	66699	66721	66721	He	329	“ Yeah , marinate on it . And while you ’re marinating , go back to the States . ”
66700	66714	66721	66721	He	329	“ Before you hang up , I have one last thing to say . ”
66715	66720	66721	66721	He	329	“ What is it ? ”
66727	66737	66721	66721	He	329	“ Do you think your stepbrother is into guys ? ”
66751	66779	66741	66741	I	329	“ It ’s a miracle you ’ve made it this far in life without being murdered . You ’re the most clueless person I ’ve ever met . ”
66863	66870	66872	66872	Antonio	100	“ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
66884	66896	66872	66872	Antonio	100	“ You ’ve been pacing like a caged tiger since yesterday ! ”
66936	66945	66929	66929	I’m	229	“ I have a lot on my mind . ”
67024	67030	67006	67006	He	100	“ What ’s her name ? ”
67070	67073	67074	67074	He	100	“ Kimber . ”
67089	67095	67074	67074	He	100	“ As in , ly ? ”
67096	67101	67074	67074	He	100	“ She shortened it . ”
67106	67116	67074	67074	He	100	“ There were five Kimberlys in her kindergarten class . ”
67232	67242	67220	67220	he	100	“ The woman in the bar the other night . ”
67243	67246	67247	67247	He	100	“ Yes . ”
67250	67254	67256	67256	he	100	“ Very beautiful . ”
67308	67315	67296	67296	technicians	1265	“ The new designs are hers . ”
67326	67389	67316	67316	He	100	“ Ah ! Good ! I need to ask her about the feathers on look number twenty . Valentina has ordered the bleached peacock , but there ’s a delicate floating accent on the hem that could either be ostrich or . . . what is this face you ’re making ? You look like you ate a plate of bad clams . ”
67396	67402	67390	67390	I	329	“ The designs are hers . ”
67417	67426	67403	67403	He	100	“ You did n’t buy them from her ? ”
67427	67430	67403	67403	He	100	“ No . ”
67431	67442	67403	67403	He	100	“ She has n’t given you permission to use them ? ”
67443	67446	67403	67403	He	100	“ No . ”
67460	67475	67449	67449	he	100	“ That ’s theft ! She ’ll sue ! She ’ll ruin your name ! ”
67476	67489	67403	67403	He	100	“ Not when I ’m done with her , she wo n’t . ”
67497	67513	67490	67490	He	100	“ You ’re going to put her in a sex coma , is that it ? ”
67516	67536	67575	67575	He	100	“ I ’m going to convince her it ’s better to have me as a friend than an enemy . ”
67566	67574	67575	67575	He	100	“ You ’ve threatened this poor woman ? ”
67612	67624	67642	67642	Antonio	100	“ Of course not ! You know me better than that . ”
67625	67635	67642	67642	Antonio	100	“ Then I do n’t understand what you mean . ”
67636	67641	67642	67642	Antonio	100	“ It ’s complicated . ”
67695	67734	67691	67691	he	100	“ Stealing is n’t the way to compensate for the designs that snake Riccardo destroyed when he left . This is beneath the House of Moretti . This is beneath you . We ’ll scale down the show — ”
67735	67743	67744	67744	I	329	“ There has to be fifty pieces , ”
67752	67760	67744	67744	I	329	“ We always show fifty new looks ! ”
67761	67766	67767	67767	he	329	“ Of our own , ”
67799	67807	67790	67790	I	329	“ Think of it as a collaboration . ”
67808	67816	67817	67817	he	329	“ I ’ll do no such thing ! ”
67822	67830	67817	67817	he	329	“ We do n’t collaborate with anyone ! ”
67831	67841	67790	67790	I	329	“ Interesting that ’s your takeaway on the situation . ”
67851	67893	67842	67842	He	329	“ Eh , my takeaway . My takeaway is that you ’ve lost your mind . I should look for a new job now , before word gets out that I work in a den of thieves and I ’m unemployable . ”
67901	67922	67923	67923	He	329	“ To think of all the years of dedicated service I ’ve given you . My loyalty repaid like this . ”
67944	67953	67923	67923	He	329	“ I ’ll die in disgrace . Ah ! ”
68000	68013	67978	67978	I	329	“ You asked what was wrong with me . I told you . ”
68014	68027	68028	68028	he	329	“ So accusing ! You ’d think I was the thief here ! ”
68035	68052	67978	67978	I	329	“ I never said I stole the designs , you carping old woman . We traded . ”
68065	68068	68053	68053	He	329	“ Traded ? ”
68069	68075	68053	68053	He	329	“ For a plane ticket . ”
68076	68086	68094	68094	he	329	“ Well , why did n’t you say so ? ”
68102	68114	68094	68094	he	329	“ A trade ! This is business ! This is good ! ”
68133	68148	68128	68128	I	329	“ But I promised her I would n’t use her designs in the show . ”
68157	68167	68149	68149	His	329	“ This is bad . This is very bad . ”
68168	68178	68149	68149	His	329	“ What if I said she ’s my stepsister ? ”
68236	68243	68225	68225	He	329	“ Sorry — ex - stepsister . ”
68244	68255	68225	68225	He	329	“ But . . . you ’re attracted to her . ”
68256	68279	68225	68225	He	329	“ Of course I ’m attracted to her . A man would have to be blind not to be attracted to her . ”
68321	68329	68318	68318	he	100	“ It still seems like a sin . ”
68330	68337	68338	68338	I	329	“ It ’s not a sin , ”
68342	68352	68338	68338	I	329	“ Why does everything have to be a sin ? ”
68364	68377	68353	68353	He	100	“ I do n’t make the rules . Talk to the pope . ”
68392	68419	68380	68380	I	329	“ I do n’t need to talk to the pope . It ’s not a sin . It ’s not illegal . It ’s not anything . ”
68420	68434	68353	68353	He	100	“ If it ’s not anything , why are you so worked up ? ”
68463	68469	68445	68445	I	329	“ She ’s ignoring me . ”
68477	68480	68474	68474	Antonio	100	“ Oh . ”
68493	68495	68474	68474	Antonio	100	“ oh ”
68498	68501	68474	68474	Antonio	100	“ oh . ”
68502	68505	68474	68474	Antonio	100	“ What ? ”
68506	68509	68510	68510	He	100	“ Ha ! ”
68520	68533	68510	68510	He	100	“ Ha ha ! I never thought I ’d see the day ! ”
68534	68543	68474	68474	Antonio	100	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
68559	68565	68544	68544	He	100	“ You ’re in love ! ”
68596	68601	68602	68602	I	329	“ Back to work ! ”
68645	68654	68634	68634	Antonio	100	“ He ’s in love with his stepsister ! ”
68679	68682	68683	68683	I	329	“ Ex ! ”
68703	68725	68697	68697	Antonio	100	“ Ex - stepsister ! And I ’m not in love with her ! No one is in love with anyone ! ”
68761	68840	68752	68752	he	100	“ Ah , Matteo . You make a very handsome couple . The children — oh ! They ’ll be beautiful . I ’ve worried so long about you being alone . All you do is work , never taking time to meet a nice woman and settle down . I ’m sure if you write the pope a letter explaining the entire situation , he wo n’t let your souls burn in the eternal lake of fire . ”
68848	68852	68841	68841	I	329	“ Jesus Christ . ”
68856	68859	68853	68853	Antonio	100	“ Exactly . ”
68888	68891	68879	68879	I	329	“ Answer , ”
68895	68898	68879	68879	I	329	“ Pronto ! ”
68899	68910	68920	68920	her	1279	“ Uh . . . pronto yourself . I guess . ”
68939	68942	68932	68932	I	329	“ Kimber . ”
68943	68989	68920	68920	her	1279	“ Matteo . Now that we ’ve confirmed we know each other ’s names , are you ready to talk ? Or do you need a few minutes to finish skinning the cat or whatever you ’re doing that ’s got you so worked up ? ”
68997	69007	68994	68994	I	329	“ I ’m . Not . Worked . Up . ”
69008	69020	68994	68994	I	329	“ Really ? Hmm . ’Cause you sound kinda worked up . ”
69039	69047	69048	69048	I	329	“ Just dealing with some employee problems . ”
69071	69082	69048	69048	I	329	“ Okay . We ’ll do this some other time . ”
69083	69098	69061	69061	He	100	“ Wait ! Do n’t hang up ! I need to talk to you ! ”
69148	69154	69156	69156	Kimber	48	“ What was that noise ? ”
69158	69164	69197	69197	she	48	“ I closed a door . ”
69165	69177	69197	69197	she	48	“ Closed ? Sounded like you put some stank on it . ”
69178	69195	69197	69197	she	48	“ I have no idea what that means . What have you decided about my offer ? ”
69208	69213	69214	69214	she	48	“ Well . . . ”
69224	69243	69221	69221	she	48	“ I suppose I can survive two dozen kisses from you if it means getting my designs back . ”
69278	69298	69244	69244	I	329	“ I have some free time tomorrow . Say , from five o’clock to five - oh - one ? ”
69299	69313	69244	69244	I	329	“ No . Today . And I ’ll need more than one minute . ”
69314	69322	69323	69323	she	48	“ You never said anything about timing , ”
69335	69345	69244	69244	I	329	“ A proper kiss takes more than one minute . ”
69346	69365	69323	69323	she	48	“ That sounds ominous . I think we need to discuss the particulars before we go any further . ”
69382	69384	69413	69413	She	48	“ particular ”
69407	69412	69388	69388	I	329	“ So . Discuss . ”
69428	69439	69425	69425	she	48	“ That tone is pissing me off , Count Egotistico . ”
69456	69464	69450	69450	I	329	“ What does n’t piss you off ? ”
69465	69489	69501	69501	She	48	“ The list is long . It includes all kinds of fun things , like rainbows , puppies , nonassholey men . . . ”
69490	69500	69450	69450	I	329	“ Very funny . I ’m not an asshole . ”
69504	69512	69501	69501	She	48	“ That ’s what they all say . ”
69531	69542	69526	69526	I	329	“ Let ’s get back to the subject at hand . ”
69543	69560	69501	69501	She	48	“ Sure . One minute and not a second longer . That ’s my final offer . ”
69561	69565	69526	69526	I	329	“ Five minutes . ”
69566	69576	69501	69501	She	48	“ What ? Who kisses for five minutes straight ? ”
69580	69599	69577	69577	I	329	“ I ’d like to kiss you for five hours straight , but we have to start somewhere . ”
69612	69618	69609	69609	she	48	“ This is so weird . ”
69619	69643	69652	69652	She	48	“ Do n’t forget you can tattle on me to my mother if I do n’t hold up my end of the bargain . ”
69644	69651	69609	69609	she	48	“ Yeah , there is that . ”
69685	69689	69674	69674	I	329	“ Four minutes . ”
69690	69714	69717	69717	she	48	“ Ugh . I ca n’t even look at your face for four minutes at a time , let alone suck on it . ”
69735	69745	69729	69729	I	329	“ Perhaps you ’d rather look at my chest . ”
69758	69781	69717	69717	she	48	“ You know , every time I think you ’re not a complete dick , you do something to prove me wrong . ”
69787	69796	69782	69782	My	329	“ And we ’re back to my dick . ”
69797	69806	69859	69859	she	62	“ I never said anything about your dick ! ”
69807	69814	69782	69782	My	329	“ You did . Just then . ”
69815	69822	69859	69859	she	62	“ No , I did not ! ”

69932	69950	69918	69918	I	329	“ I accept your offer . I ’ll see you at your shop at five o’clock sharp . ”

72475	72484	72459	72459	He	398	“ Sorry . Two minutes , you said . ”
72485	72491	72459	72459	He	398	“ You started a timer ? ”
72492	72503	72459	72459	He	398	“ Do n’t want to go over , do we ? ”
72507	72514	72504	72504	I	329	“ How are you so irritating ? ”
72523	72530	72515	72515	He	398	“ Just lucky , I guess . ”
72682	72694	72679	72679	he	398	“ I think you needed this as much as I did . ”
72704	72723	72679	72679	he	398	“ I still hate you , but I have time left , so please shut the hell up . ”
73055	73060	73049	73049	He	398	“ Time ’s up . ”
73070	73094	73062	73062	he	398	“ That was mediocre . If you ’re not going to put your heart into it , let ’s forget the whole thing . ”
73530	73536	73537	73537	I	329	“ I wo n’t date , ”
73545	73580	73537	73537	I	329	“ I ’ll become a nun . I ’ll marry Jesus . He wo n’t care that I ’m the laughingstock of San Francisco . He wo n’t care that I ’m damaged goods . ”
73672	73675	73658	73658	He	1344	“ Babe ? ”
73676	73687	73658	73658	He	1344	“ You ’re not allowed to call me that anymore ! ”
73688	73695	73696	73696	He	1344	“ Oh . Uh , sorry . ”
73711	73716	73696	73696	He	1344	“ Are you okay ? ”
73717	73726	73784	73784	He	1344	“ No . Are you still in Italy ? ”
73727	73730	73696	73696	He	1344	“ Yeah . ”
73731	73747	73784	73784	He	1344	“ Good . I ’ve figured out how you can make it up to me . ”
73748	73758	73759	73759	he	1344	“ I ca n’t come out to my parents , ”
73766	73772	73759	73759	he	1344	“ Anything else but that ! ”
73773	73783	73784	73784	He	1344	“ This has nothing to do with your parents . ”
73790	73797	73784	73784	He	1344	“ Okay . What is it ? ”
73798	73811	73812	73812	I	329	“ Come to DiSanto Couture in the morning , eight o’clock sharp . ”
73822	73828	73812	73812	I	329	“ Do n’t be late . ”
73829	73842	73847	73847	he	1344	“ I wo n’t ! I ’ll be there right on time ! ”
73850	73856	73847	73847	he	1344	“ What ’re we doing ? ”
73857	73862	73863	73863	I	329	“ Taking your measurements . ”
74014	74023	73997	73997	he	1344	“ I need you to model for me . ”
74024	74031	73997	73997	he	1344	“ Model ? What , clothes ? ”
74035	74047	74032	74032	I	329	“ No . Taxidermy animals . It ’s my new hobby . ”
74053	74064	74048	74048	He	1344	“ Would I , like , hold them or something ? ”
74065	74079	74048	74048	He	1344	“ Dude . That was a joke . You ’ve heard of those . ”
74080	74090	74048	74048	He	1344	“ Oh right . Ha ha . Good one . ”
74173	74177	74169	74169	Whoever	240	“ love is blind ”
74251	74254	74225	74225	he	1345	“ I do ”
74356	74377	74339	74339	Brad	418	“ The way you ’re looking at me is , um , kinda scary . Did I say something wrong ? ”
74508	74552	74505	74505	I	329	“ I ’m still mad at you for being dishonest . But it ’s not all your fault . I ca n’t hang all the blame on you , because I was busy being an idiot , too , just in different ways . ”
74559	74590	74553	74553	I	329	“ So if you ever decide to come out to your parents , I ’ll go with you . You wo n’t have to handle that conversation alone . Okay ? ”
74633	74636	74630	74630	he	329	“ Okay . ”
74697	74700	74701	74701	he	329	“ Sorry , ”
74714	74736	74701	74701	he	329	“ I ’ve seen you cry more in the last week than I have in the entire time we were together . ”
74740	74749	74737	74737	He	329	“ Tough guys are n’t supposed to cry . ”
74825	74830	74813	74813	Brad	418	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
74831	74845	74846	74846	He	329	“ It ’s inconvenient feeling empathy for someone you previously decided to hate . ”
74859	74869	74846	74846	He	329	“ So that means you do n’t hate me ? ”
74889	74907	74877	74877	I	329	“ How is this my life , God ? Did I do something to personally offend you ? ”
74932	74988	75084	75084	He	329	“ Because I ’d do anything to stay friends with you , even if you do n’t want the money and stuff . I meant it when I said you were the only one I ever felt safe with . You ’re my best friend , and there ’s nothing I would n’t do to — ”
74989	75006	75007	75007	I	329	“ We ’re not breaking out the BFF charm bracelets and matching outfits yet , pal , ”
75011	75034	75007	75007	I	329	“ Let ’s wait until after I get the results from my STD test to see how things are going to go . ”
75035	75040	75084	75084	He	329	“ I ’m clean ! ”
75054	75060	75041	75041	I	329	“ You sound pretty sure . ”
75061	75071	75007	75007	I	329	“ I am . I get tested every month ! ”
75145	75170	75135	75135	I	329	“ If you were ‘ safe , ’ like you said you always were , why would you need to get tested every month ? ”
75178	75194	75171	75171	He	329	“ I ’m afraid if I tell you the truth , you ’ll deck me . ”
75195	75204	75171	75171	He	329	“ I might deck you anyway . Talk . ”
75229	75283	75205	75205	He	329	“ Because nothing is one hundred percent effective there ’s always a chance you can pick up something bad even if you use protection and I was scared I might pass something on to you so I got tested a lot to make sure I was clean so you would n’t catch anything . ”
75312	75324	75284	75284	He	329	“ You ’re telling me you were trying to protect me ? ”
75328	75342	75325	75325	He	329	“ From getting a sexually transmitted disease that you might unknowingly have had ? ”
75359	75394	75355	75355	My	329	“ Because you were sleeping around so much , with so many different partners , that the risk of catching a nasty virus was so high you had to be tested once a month ? ”
75399	75411	75413	75413	he	329	“ Sometimes more often than that , just to be sure . ”
75416	75429	75413	75413	he	329	“ But I ’m totally clean , so we ’re all good ! ”
75490	75498	75478	75479	a man	428	“ I hope I ’m not interrupting . ”
75733	75740	75741	75741	Kimber	48	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
75754	75763	75741	75741	Kimber	48	“ I was on my way to work . ”
75874	75881	75865	75865	Kimber	48	“ So continue on your way . ”
75906	75915	75903	75903	I	329	“ You do n’t need to me stay ? ”
75924	75927	75922	75922	she	48	“ No , ”
75932	75935	75922	75922	she	48	“ Yes . ”
75939	75946	75922	75922	she	48	“ I was n’t asking you ! ”
75987	75995	75984	75984	I	329	“ What the fuck is going on ? ”
76003	76007	76000	76000	Brad	418	“ So intense . ”
76047	76059	76060	76060	She	48	“ Cool your jets , Count , he was just leaving ! ”
76067	76081	76060	76060	She	48	“ I ’ll talk to you later . Go back to your hotel . ”
76127	76130	76146	76146	She	48	“ Matteo . ”
76158	76162	76163	76163	She	48	“ Step aside . ”
76231	76235	76237	76237	Kimber	48	“ Your turn , ”
76272	76282	76258	76258	she	48	“ I ’m not doing this with you now . ”
76283	76287	76288	76288	I	329	“ Doing what ? ”
76292	76299	76300	76300	she	48	“ Do n’t play that game , ”
76335	76343	76322	76322	she	48	“ What do you want from me ? ”
76373	76380	76358	76358	I	329	“ Time to eat the frog . ”
76386	76390	76381	76381	She	48	“ Excuse me ? ”
76391	76435	76457	76457	God	1857	“ It ’s something my father used to say . If eating a frog is the worst thing you have to do in a day , do n’t put it off . Do it first thing and get it out of the way . ”
76444	76456	76436	76436	Her	48	“ You ’re comparing kissing me to eating a fucking frog ? ”
76564	76577	76578	76578	I	329	“ It ’s a metaphor . But I was talking about you , ”
76587	76621	76578	76578	I	329	“ I ’m the frog you have to eat . Might as well get it over with early so you do n’t have to think about it for the rest of your day . ”
76626	76649	76622	76622	Her	48	“ You do n’t get to call all the shots here . You ca n’t just show up unannounced , demanding kisses . ”
76650	76671	76672	76672	She	48	“ Yes I can . I just did . And I ’ll do it again . Give me my kiss . ”
76676	76700	76672	76672	She	48	“ For a guy who said I ’m a mediocre kisser , you ’re awfully eager to shove your tongue down my throat . ”
76739	76754	76711	76711	she	48	“ I ’m sorry . That was stupid . It wo n’t happen again . ”
76777	76786	76772	76772	she	48	“ Why did you say it , then ? ”
76787	76795	76830	76830	she	48	“ I wanted to rile you up . ”
76813	76828	76796	76796	She	48	“ So . . . you do n’t think I ’m a bad kisser ? ”
77005	77030	77002	77002	I	329	“ If I thought you were a bad kisser , I would n’t be trying so hard to kiss you , now would I ? ”
77063	77075	77060	77060	she	48	“ Okay , fine , let ’s get this over with . ”
77206	77215	77201	77201	She	235	“ Clara . Uh . Whuz happenin ’ ? ”
77296	77309	77310	77310	She	235	“ I need your direction on the bodice of the blue gown . ”
77374	77381	77382	77382	I	329	“ Oh . Uh - huh . ”
77389	77393	77382	77382	I	329	“ ’ Kay . ”
77424	77431	77432	77432	I	329	“ Whoa ! Easy , tiger ! ”
77458	77482	77483	77483	I	329	“ Nope . No way . No more . Got ta get to work . Clara needs me . You heard the woman . ”
77497	77503	77483	77483	I	329	“ Back to the trenches ! ”
77514	77531	77504	77504	His	398	“ Are you sure you ’re ready to go back to work ? You seem disoriented . ”
77532	77538	77540	77540	I	329	“ I am totally fine . ”
77595	77598	77599	77599	He	398	“ Fine ? ”
77613	77623	77599	77599	He	398	“ I ’ll have to do better next time . ”
77641	77649	77650	77650	I	329	“ We need to set a schedule , ”
77673	77692	77650	77650	I	329	“ I ca n’t have you showing up like this , interrupting me whenever you feel like it . ”
77710	77734	77693	77693	He	398	“ That ’s reasonable . How about after dinner every night ? Say , eight o’clock ? I ’ll drop by the house . ”
77768	77779	77765	77765	I	329	“ Okay . Good . See you then . Bye . ”
77792	77799	77787	77787	he	398	“ Why was your ex here ? ”
77854	77860	77861	77861	she	242	“ Tell him the truth , ”
77869	77884	77861	77861	she	242	“ Tell him Brad is gay and there ’s nothing going on between you . ”
77895	77904	77905	77905	he	398	“ Drag this smug asshole over the coals , ”
77911	77971	77905	77905	he	398	“ You think you ’re the only broad he ’s makin ’ a run for ? Do n’t be naive . He ’s got tail all over town . You ca n’t be this stupid again . And by the way , dipshit , you ’re supposed to be thinking with your brain , not your vagina , remember ? ”
78004	78011	78040	78040	he	398	“ I asked him to come . ”
78024	78027	78012	78012	Matteo	398	“ Why ? ”
78028	78034	78040	78040	he	398	“ We have unfinished business . ”
78056	78060	78061	78061	he	398	“ Unfinished business , ”
78099	78131	78132	78132	Matteo	398	“ He ’s begged me to forgive him . He ’s apologized , and I believe he ’s truly sorry . And now . . . we ’re working it out . ”
78178	78186	78175	78175	He	398	“ What exactly are you working out ? ”
78204	78217	78175	78175	He	398	“ Give me all my sketches back and I ’ll tell you . ”
78240	78261	78229	78229	I	329	“ You sure are crabby all of a sudden , Count . Are you feeling okay ? You seem disoriented . ”
78301	78335	78294	78294	He	398	“ Not as disoriented as you were a moment ago , bella . I could ’ve pushed you against the wall and taken you standing up , you were so ready for it . ”
78390	78399	78373	78373	His	398	“ Challenge accepted . See you at eight . ”
78525	78534	78513	78513	Matteo	398	“ Do you not know how to drive ? ”
78535	78552	78553	78553	He	398	“ You people drive like psychos . I do n’t want to get into an accident . ”
78571	78591	78553	78553	He	398	“ I ’m happy to drive you to and from work . All you have to do is ask . ”
78592	78611	78553	78553	He	398	“ So you can spy on me and see what new designs I ’m creating ? No thanks . ”
78619	78636	78612	78612	His	398	“ Is that why you think I came by this morning ? To spy on you ? ”
78637	78656	78612	78612	His	398	“ I find it hard to believe you ’d go to all this trouble just to kiss me . ”
78686	78692	78674	78674	he	398	“ It ’s no trouble . ”
78750	78754	78755	78755	I	329	“ All right , ”
78761	78769	78755	78755	I	329	“ Let ’s get this over with . ”
78799	78811	78795	78795	Matteo	398	“ Let ’s go inside . I have n’t eaten yet . ”
78812	78827	78849	78849	he	398	“ I have n’t , either , but this is n’t a dinner date . ”
78852	78859	78849	78849	he	398	“ What is it , then ? ”
78860	78865	78849	78849	he	398	“ A business deal . ”
78908	78918	78919	78919	He	398	“ You want to conduct business in the driveway ? ”
78964	78974	78942	78942	I	329	“ We ca n’t do it inside , either . ”
78987	78991	78975	78975	He	398	“ The garden . ”
79053	79060	79062	79062	Matteo	398	“ It ’s only a kiss , ”
79069	79084	79062	79062	Matteo	398	“ Two minutes . I ’ll time it again so you ’ll be safe . ”
79317	79324	79325	79325	I	329	“ I ca n’t do this , ”
79506	79517	79502	79502	Matteo	398	“ Is it me you do n’t trust or yourself ? ”
79583	79586	79587	79587	I	329	“ Both , ”
79600	79607	79608	79608	he	329	“ Thank you for being honest , ”
79656	79662	79663	79663	I	329	“ Do n’t run away . ”
79666	79682	79663	79663	I	329	“ That you knew I was about to makes it even harder to stay put ! ”
79683	79696	79663	79663	I	329	“ You do n’t like that I know what you ’re feeling . ”
79740	79756	79733	79733	he	329	“ But you know what I ’m feeling , too , so we ’re even . ”
79760	79776	79757	79757	I	329	“ I do n’t know what you ’re feeling . I do n’t know anything . ”
79799	79811	79792	79792	his	329	“ Yes you do . You just do n’t trust it . ”
79812	79833	79777	79777	He	329	“ I ca n’t trust it . Not only do I have questionable taste in men , we ’re enemies . ”
79834	79841	79792	79792	his	329	“ Frenemies . With kissing benefits . ”
79842	79850	79777	79777	He	329	“ That ’s not even a thing . ”
79851	79856	79792	79792	his	329	“ It is now . ”
80083	80091	80068	80068	He	398	“ You ’re thinking . Stop it . ”
80092	80116	80068	80068	He	398	“ I just realized you have n’t given me a sketch yet . For this morning , either . You owe me two . ”
80117	80123	80124	80124	he	398	“ When we ’re done , ”
80339	80357	80331	80331	His	398	“ Whatever ’s happening between you and your ex , remember this : I ’m not him . ”
80480	80488	80489	80489	He	398	“ Tomorrow , then . Eight o’clock . ”
80600	80603	80604	80604	I	329	“ Beans , ”
80868	80877	80878	80878	Brad	418	“ You ’re gon na be totally fine , ”
80885	80894	80878	80878	Brad	418	“ Trust me . It ’s all good . ”
80895	80901	80906	80906	he	1416	“ Trust you ? Really ? ”
80909	80920	80906	80906	he	1416	“ Yeah , that was an unfortunate choice of words . ”
80921	80942	80878	80878	Brad	418	“ Speaking of unfortunate choices , you might want to dial back the swooneration if you ever see Matteo again . ”
80943	80950	80906	80906	he	1416	“ Why , is he homophobic ? ”
80954	80979	80951	80951	I	329	“ Homophobia is such an inaccurate word . It ’s not a phobia . No one ’s afraid . They ’re just an asshole . ”
80983	80994	80980	80980	Brad	418	“ I think Samuel L. Jackson might ’ve said that . ”
80995	81003	80878	80878	Brad	418	“ Probably . He ’s very wise . ”
81004	81010	80980	80980	Brad	418	“ Back to the swooneration . ”
81011	81029	80878	80878	Brad	418	“ Well , from the looks of things , it makes him want to kick your ass . ”
81040	81044	81037	81037	he	1416	“ Two things . ”
81045	81048	81037	81037	he	1416	“ Shoot . ”
81049	81064	81037	81037	he	1416	“ One : You did n’t tell him I was gay , did you ? ”
81065	81068	81037	81037	he	1416	“ Nope . ”
81069	81073	81037	81037	he	1416	“ Why not ? ”
81074	81101	81037	81037	he	1416	“ You have n’t even come out to your parents . It ’s not my place to be spilling your private business all over the world . ”
81113	81131	81102	81102	Brad	418	“ I ca n’t believe you ’d have my back like that , after what I did . ”
81132	81202	81037	81037	he	1416	“ I know . I ’m amazing . You do n’t deserve me . But remember my silence does n’t apply to any female you might want to trick into marrying you by pretending you ’re straight . Where you like to stick your dick is your business until you try to ruin another poor girl ’s life , then all bets are off . What ’s number two ? ”
81203	81211	81102	81102	Brad	418	“ How serious are you about him ? ”
81244	81280	81238	81238	Brad	418	“ We were together for three years , Kimber . I know you think I ’m clueless , but even I can see that you never looked at me the way you look at him . ”
81305	81366	81298	81298	I	329	“ Maybe someday we ’ll look back on this and laugh . Maybe someday , after a few years have passed and I ’ve grown scar tissue over all the holes you tore in my heart , we can be friends again . But right now I have to be honest and say it ’s none of your damn business . ”
81367	81379	81441	81441	He	329	“ It is , though , because I care about you . ”
81380	81391	81392	81392	I	329	“ You ’ve got a funny way of showing it , ”
81395	81404	81441	81441	He	329	“ I looked him up , you know . ”
81405	81413	81441	81441	He	329	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
81414	81423	81441	81441	He	329	“ On the internet . I researched him . ”
81424	81440	81441	81441	He	329	“ Whatever you ’re about to tell me , I do n’t want to know . ”
81450	81453	81441	81441	He	329	“ Liar . ”
81472	81480	81458	81458	I	329	“ He ’s a womanizer , right ? ”
81481	81509	81510	81510	I	329	“ More like a monk . He has n’t been photographed with anyone for years . According to the gossip sites , he ’s obsessed with work . ”
81514	81525	81510	81510	I	329	“ Or he ’s just really good at keeping secrets . ”
81526	81535	81510	81510	I	329	“ Not everyone has skeletons in their closets . ”
81536	81547	81510	81510	I	329	“ Do n’t you dare talk to me about closets . ”
81554	81568	81548	81548	Brad	418	“ Right . Oops . It ’s kinda funny , though , right ? ”
81569	81588	81510	81510	I	329	“ Sure , like an inoperable brain tumor is funny . I ’m hanging up on you now . ”
81589	81606	81548	81548	Brad	418	“ Before you go , tell me when I ’m doing this modeling thing for you . ”
81615	81618	81607	81607	I	329	“ Why ? ”
81619	81633	81510	81510	I	329	“ My mom wants to know if I ’ll send her some pictures . ”
81642	81650	81634	81634	My	329	“ You told your mother about it ? ”
81651	81674	81510	81510	I	329	“ Well , yeah . I mean , my parents know I followed you to Italy to try to get you back . ”
81727	81745	81754	81754	her	1424	“ Tell your mother there will be tons of pictures . She wo n’t miss a thing . ”
81810	81836	81843	81843	idiot	1428	“ Awesome . Thanks , ba — uh , Kimber . And thanks for being so cool about everything . It really means a lot . ”
81962	81965	81966	81966	I	329	“ Great , ”
81972	81992	81966	81966	I	329	“ Why do n’t you just move in ? We ’ll all be one big happy , backstabbing family . ”
82207	82220	82186	82186	I	329	“ Do n’t let me interrupt whatever pernicious scheme you ’re hatching . ”
82224	82234	82221	82221	Matteo	398	“ Pernicious ? Have you been reading the dictionary ? ”
82249	82277	82235	82235	I	329	“ Yes . There are so many interesting words that start with the letter P. Pushy . Peacock . Pecker . Pompous . I could go on . ”
82287	82294	82284	82284	Matteo	398	“ Pact . Pattern . Paper . ”
82322	82333	82319	82319	he	398	“ Bad day , stepsister dearest ? You seem tense . ”
82350	82355	82344	82344	he	398	“ Ex - stepsister . ”
82360	82379	82356	82356	He	398	“ Yes , that ’s right . I know there ’s been some confusion over the fine print . ”
82445	82448	82449	82449	She	574	“ Dog ! ”
82542	82545	82547	82547	Matteo	398	“ Cornelia , ”
82552	82555	82547	82547	Matteo	398	“ Go . ”
82594	82602	82603	82603	I	329	“ It ’s not eight o’clock yet . ”
82645	82660	82642	82642	he	398	“ I love you in that dress . You look like a movie star . ”
82687	82694	82684	82684	He	398	“ The color matches your eyes . ”
82728	82765	82715	82715	I	329	“ It ’s one of my father ’s . A certain tiny satanic ball of fur shredded most of my clothes . I think the taxi driver on my way into work thought I was homeless . ”
82766	82781	82815	82815	I	329	“ I should ’ve warned you about Beans . She has an oral fixation . ”
82782	82790	82791	82791	I	329	“ Thanks for the heads - up , ”
82795	82802	82791	82791	I	329	“ Go back to your dinner . ”
82803	82809	82715	82715	I	329	“ Did you eat yet ? ”
82817	82820	82815	82815	I	329	“ Yes , ”
82852	82858	82845	82845	Matteo	398	“ I ’ll be back . ”
82917	82923	82925	82925	Matteo	398	“ Osso buco alla Milanese , ”
82927	82933	82925	82925	Matteo	398	“ My mother ’s specialty . ”
82934	82939	82940	82940	He	398	“ Your mother cooks ? ”
82947	82973	82940	82940	He	398	“ She ’s an incredible cook . Lorenzo usually does the honors , but on Fridays we always have a family meal she makes herself . ”
83015	83038	83068	83068	he	398	“ Those are arancini . Rice balls stuffed with cheese and ragu , coated with breadcrumbs and fried . They ’re delicious . ”
83104	83107	83101	83101	Matteo	398	“ Good ? ”
83118	83127	83108	83108	I	329	“ Oh my God . So fucking good . ”
83148	83153	83144	83144	he	398	“ So fucking good . ”
83228	83238	83268	83268	he	398	“ I do n’t need you to feed me . ”
83239	83252	83268	83268	he	398	“ You have no idea what you need . Open your mouth . ”
83274	83287	83268	83268	he	398	“ You ’re used to getting your way , are n’t you ? ”
83288	83296	83297	83297	He	398	“ Yes . Now open your mouth . ”
83492	83497	83498	83498	he	398	“ So fucking good , ”
83525	83528	83513	83513	I	329	“ Matteo — ”
83529	83532	83533	83533	He	398	“ Hush . ”
83643	83649	83669	83669	He	398	“ The door ’s open ! ”
83653	83658	83650	83650	He	398	“ Fuck the door , ”
83946	83958	83942	83942	He	329	“ Tell me what you just thought that made you tremble . ”
83959	83974	83942	83942	He	329	“ I want to feel that rough jaw on the inside of my thighs . ”
84368	84373	84374	84374	He	398	“ Spread your legs . ”
84775	84780	84742	84742	He	398	“ Look at you . ”
84781	84785	84742	84742	He	398	“ So sweet . ”
84786	84790	84742	84742	He	398	“ Cosi perfetta . ”
84791	84798	84742	84742	He	398	“ Il mio perfetta dolci amore . ”
84882	84885	84886	84886	He	398	“ Easy . ”
84937	84945	84930	84930	I	329	“ Just breathe , bella . Shh . ”
84946	84951	84966	84966	His	398	“ I ’m okay . ”
84952	84965	84930	84930	I	329	“ You ’re not . And do n’t lie to me again . ”
85041	85057	85027	85027	He	398	“ Running away wo n’t solve anything . Talk to me . What just happened ? ”
85088	85098	85073	85073	I	329	“ I ’m not as tough as I act . ”
85107	85111	85112	85112	he	398	“ I know , ”
85122	85134	85112	85112	he	398	“ It ’s one of the things I adore about you . ”
85176	85187	85202	85202	He	398	“ I do n’t understand why you ’re doing this . ”
85188	85192	85202	85202	He	398	“ Doing what ? ”
85230	85316	85342	85342	His	1458	“ You told me you wanted to buy my father ’s business . You made it clear you do n’t think I have what it takes to make it in fashion here . And this game you ’re playing , the kissing game — what ’s the point ? Are you hoping I ’ll develop feelings for you so I ’ll sell ? Are you trying to make me fall in love with you so you can get what you really want — the business ? ”
85333	85341	85326	85326	His	1458	“ Do you have feelings for me ? ”
85422	85436	85410	85410	I	329	“ What were you and your mother talking about when I came in ? ”
85460	85464	85457	85457	he	1458	“ Nothing important . ”
85465	85482	85457	85457	he	1458	“ If it ’s not important you can share it with me . What was it ? ”
85534	85538	85531	85531	I	329	“ Step back . ”
85562	85580	85590	85590	he	1458	“ Unless you want me to turn your balls into pancakes with my knee , step back . ”
85652	85662	85663	85663	His	1458	“ Tell me if you have feelings for me . ”
85669	85678	85663	85663	His	1458	“ Tell me if you ’re manipulating me . ”
85689	85699	85684	85684	he	1458	“ I told you — I’m not your ex . ”
85700	85733	85663	85663	His	1458	“ Which is exactly what a man trying to manipulate me would say . It would ’ve been easier for you to simply say no . Unless the real answer is yes . ”
85752	85903	85684	85684	he	1458	“ Okay , you want me to talk to you ? Here goes . I ’ll give you my worst - case scenario . Your mother — who , by your own admission , is disappointed in you — needs some insurance on my promise not to kick her out of the house . She got nothing from my father in his will , which must ’ve really stung , but his dopey daughter was recently dumped in the most spectacular way , and she ’s vulnerable . She owns a business that you ’d like to get your hands on and an expensive house your mother would like to legally get her hands on , so the two of you decide that you ’ll work your magic and make the dopey daughter fall in love with you so she ’ll hand over the keys to the kingdom with a smile .
85904	85993	86054	86054	I	329	“ Conveniently , you ’re in possession of a sketch pad the dopey daughter desperately wants back , so you concoct a clever ploy that forces the two of you to spend time with your faces stuck together . What better way to get those hormones wreaking havoc on her brain ? Once you ’ve convinced her to sell you the business and put your mother on the title of the house , you ’ll be back in your mother ’s good graces and everyone lives happily ever after .
85994	86011	86054	86054	I	329	“ Except me . The idiot Kimberella , screwed by another toad masquerading as a prince . ”
86046	86053	86034	86034	his	398	“ That ’s what you think ? ”
86088	86095	86083	86083	His	398	“ Tell me I ’m wrong . ”
86096	86108	86109	86109	he	398	“ That ’s the kind of man you think I am , ”
86112	86142	86109	86109	he	398	“ A lying , scheming , manipulative prick so desperate for his mother ’s approval he ’d fake his attraction to you before he even knew who you were . ”
86151	86204	86148	86148	he	398	“ At the airport , I did n’t know who you were . At the hotel , I still did n’t know who you were . I only found out you were Luca ’s daughter when I walked into the living room of this house and you were sitting on the sofa . ”
86230	86251	86221	86221	he	398	“ Maybe you decided after you discovered who I was that the mutual attraction would make it easier all around . ”
86252	86262	86263	86263	he	398	“ Easier to fuck you over , you mean , ”
86319	86354	86314	86317	the man a Tums	1463	“ Tell me you ’re not . Tell me I ’ve made the whole thing up in my head . Tell me what you and your mother were talking about when I came in . ”
86360	86367	86355	86355	He	1463	“ We were talking about you . ”
86372	86377	86378	86378	I	329	“ What about me ? ”
86389	86406	86385	86385	He	1463	“ You would n’t believe me if I told you , so what ’s the point ? ”
86407	86414	86385	86385	He	1463	“ Maybe you should try me ! ”
86415	86422	86385	86385	He	1463	“ Maybe you should trust me ! ”
86439	86453	86432	86432	I	329	“ Sorry , Count , trust is something I ’m fresh out of . ”
86487	86496	86476	86476	He	1463	“ I ’m . A. Fucking . Marchese . ”
86524	86533	86521	86521	I	329	“ Way to put some stank on it ! ”
86979	86994	86964	86964	she	1931	“ I ca n’t believe you have n’t called me back in two weeks ! ”
86995	87024	86964	86964	she	1931	“ I know . I ’m a terrible friend . But life has decided I ’m great for target practice , and I ’ve been busy dodging bullets . ”
87025	87038	86964	86964	she	1931	“ Your dad . Oh , honey , I ’m so sorry . ”
87039	87044	86964	86964	she	1931	“ Jenner told you ? ”
87045	87098	86964	86964	she	1931	“ He did . Also about your shop , your hot stepbrother , your weird stepmother , and the two dress - wearing dogs who eat at the table . I ’ve been pestering him constantly for updates . Your life has more plot twists than the subtitled Korean melodramas I watch . ”
87099	87123	86964	86964	she	1931	“ If it makes you feel any better , you ’re the first one to hear this : Brad followed me to Italy . ”
87145	87148	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ What ? ”
87149	87156	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ And he ’s still here . ”
87157	87160	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ No ! ”
87161	87164	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ Yep . ”
87165	87172	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ What does that rat want ? ”
87173	87179	87180	87180	I	329	“ Redemption , I suppose . ”
87190	87205	87180	87180	I	329	“ He begged me to forgive him . He still wants to get married . ”
87218	87232	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ That dick . The nerve ! Have you hired the hitman yet ? ”
87233	87249	87180	87180	I	329	“ I do n’t know any hitmen . Not every Italian is in the mafia . ”
87250	87272	87206	87206	Danielle	1931	“ But every Italian probably knows someone in the mafia , right ? Or someone who knows someone who knows someone . ”
87273	87283	87180	87180	I	329	“ You ’ve been watching too many crime shows . ”
87284	87288	87289	87289	she	1931	“ Oh right , ”
87295	87309	87289	87289	she	1931	“ You ca n’t tell me . Plausible deniability . That ’s smart . ”
87310	87318	87180	87180	I	329	“ There ’s no hitman , Danielle . ”
87319	87325	87326	87326	She	1931	“ Sure there is n’t . ”
87334	87343	87326	87326	She	1931	“ Do you think the line is tapped ? ”
87344	87374	87326	87326	She	1931	“ No , but I do think you should take up writing mystery novels . That imagination of yours is being wasted . How are Brian and the kids ? ”
87379	87418	87375	87375	Her	1931	“ Everyone ’s good . The kids are back to school soon , which is lucky because I ’m one mood change away from a meltdown . I do n’t remember us being so dramatic at that age . ”
87464	87479	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ We were too busy being dorky to be dramatic . Remember my hairstyle ? ”
87480	87503	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Sweet Jesus , the perm . You looked like you styled your hair by sticking your finger into an electrical outlet . ”
87504	87512	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Let ’s not forget your headgear . ”
87513	87539	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Four years of wandering around in public looking like I ’d just arrived from outer space . I ’m still not over the trauma . ”
87540	87574	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ At least you got those beautiful straight teeth at the end of it . I ’m still stuck with hair that refuses to hold a curl unless it ’s chemically forced to . ”
87575	87598	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Your hair is gorgeous ! Do you know how many girls with frizzy hair would kill for it to be straight ? ”
87614	87619	87608	87608	I	329	“ I miss you . ”
87620	87647	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ I miss you , too . When are you headed back to San Fran ? I can probably arrange to come out for Labor Day . ”
87648	87666	87608	87608	I	329	“ I ’m not going back to San Francisco . I ’ve decided to stay in Italy . ”
87674	87686	87667	87667	Danielle	1931	“ Does this have anything to do with the hot stepbrother ? ”
87687	87690	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ No . ”
87693	87706	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ It ’s just time for me to make a clean start . ”
87707	87738	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Did you tell Jenner that ? I ca n’t imagine he ’d let you move thousands of miles away that easily . You two are attached at the hip . ”
87739	87771	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Yes , I told him . He does n’t approve . He ’ll be here in a few weeks for the Milan fashion shows . He ’ll browbeat me then . ”
87772	87791	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Good luck . I would n’t want to be on the end of a browbeating from Jenner . ”
87792	87800	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ He ’s more bark than bite . ”
87801	87822	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Are you kidding ? I ’ve seen him reduce people to tears with one look . He ’s terrifying . ”
87823	87836	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ He ’s British . They ’re skilled at frightening the peasants . ”
87856	87875	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Honey , I have to go , but I promise I ’ll call you soon , okay ? ”
87876	87902	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ You better , or I ’ll send my girls to Italy for their next school break and let you deal with the little monsters . ”
87903	87908	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Speaking of terrifying . ”
87909	87915	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Love you , kiddo . ”
87916	87924	87419	87419	Danielle	1931	“ Love you , too . Bye . ”
87988	87993	87978	87978	He	398	“ Oh . Hi . ”
87999	88004	87994	87994	He	398	“ This is yours . ”
88062	88076	88054	88054	My	329	“ Okay . I ’ll bite . Why are you giving it back ? ”
88077	88085	88086	88086	he	398	“ I do n’t want it anymore , ”
88098	88106	88086	88086	he	398	“ It ’s not worth the headache . ”
88134	88138	88139	88139	I	329	“ I see . ”
88166	88170	88148	88148	I	329	“ Thank you . ”
88171	88176	88139	88139	I	329	“ You ’re welcome . ”
88212	88219	88148	88148	I	329	“ So our deal is off ? ”
88220	88235	88236	88236	he	398	“ I ’m not going to use your designs and claim they ’re mine , ”
88293	88303	88290	88290	I	329	“ What brought about this sudden change of heart ? ”
88304	88318	88319	88319	His	398	“ As if you do n’t know . It does n’t matter anyway . ”
88323	88326	88319	88319	His	398	“ Right ? ”
88403	88408	88391	88391	I	329	“ It might matter . ”
88409	88416	88417	88417	he	398	“ Might does n’t cut it , ”
88430	88436	88426	88426	his	398	“ Do n’t do that . ”
88466	88471	88472	88472	I	329	“ It does matter , ”
88475	88485	88472	88472	I	329	“ I ’m just not sure what that means . ”
88496	88531	88493	88493	he	398	“ I understand . You have a lot to deal with right now . I ’m making your life more complicated . The last thing I want is to be a problem for you . ”
88549	88563	88564	88564	He	398	“ I do n’t want to be a problem for you , either . ”
88567	88591	88564	88564	He	398	“ You ’re not a problem . You ’re the best thing that ’s happened to me since I was ten years old . ”
88615	88618	88619	88619	I	329	“ Oh , ”
88628	88640	88619	88619	I	329	“ Um . What happened when you were ten years old ? ”
88641	88713	88714	88714	His	1483	“ My mother finally bought me the puppy I ’d been begging for . A Great Dane , like Cornelia . I named her Maria , after my favorite opera singer . I loved her with all my heart . She slept in my bed every night , even when she grew too big for it . I ’d scoot all the way to the edge so she ’d have room . ”
88790	88802	88826	88827	Dear God	1857	“ You had a favorite opera singer when you were little ? ”
88803	88822	88826	88827	Dear God	1857	“ Opera was all I was allowed to listen to . My parents wanted me to be cultured . ”
88847	88856	88858	88859	Matteo forlornly	398	“ Maria got cancer and died , though , ”
88873	88878	88826	88827	Dear God	1857	“ That ’s awful . ”
88879	88980	88981	88981	His	398	“ Yes . She was my best friend . I was outside playing with her when my father died . My mother sent the nanny to get me , but I would n’t come in . I did n’t want to be inside his room , where it smelled like sickness and was dark all the time . So I refused to come in , and my father died , and my mother never forgave me . She sent me away to boarding school after that , but from then on she always had a Great Dane in the house . ”
88986	89001	88981	88981	His	398	“ It was her way of making sure I never forgot what I did . ”
89142	89148	89149	89149	I	329	“ I had a hamster , ”
89152	89181	89149	89149	I	329	“ Named Bugs . After my favorite cartoon character , Bugs Bunny . He lived a really long time , though . Way past the normal life expectancy . ”
89202	89205	89199	89199	He	398	“ Oh . ”
89251	89265	89266	89266	I	329	“ It ’s just that I ’m terrified you ’ll break my heart . ”
89318	89467	89309	89309	Matteo	398	“ You challenge me . It ’s never easy with you . And I like that . I think I need it . I feel more alive when I ’m around you , even though mostly I ’d like to smack you for being so annoying . I spend most of my time bitching at you when we ’re together , and all of my time thinking about you when we ’re not . I met you at the absolute worst time of my life , when everything I cared about was suddenly taken from me . And now I ’m off balance . I ca n’t trust my own judgment . I ca n’t decide if you ’re a fantasy or a nightmare . A prince or a villain . The best thing that ’s ever happened to me , or the worst . So . . . ”
89476	89497	89468	89468	I	329	“ I ’m scared . I ’m scared , but I ’ve never wanted anything more than I want you . ”
89508	89532	89504	89504	Matteo	398	“ I ’m not a prince , bella . How many times do I have to tell you ? I ’m a marchese . ”
89599	89604	89596	89596	him	329	“ I adore you , ”
89606	89613	89582	89582	he	329	“ You ’re safe with me , ”
89615	89621	89596	89596	him	329	“ That was so brave , ”
89623	89635	89582	89582	he	329	“ How soon can we get you out of this dress ? ”
89636	89646	89647	89647	I	329	“ Promise me you ’ll never lie to me , ”
89660	89671	89655	89655	he	329	“ You warned me never to say the P word . ”
89675	89683	89672	89672	I	329	“ Promise me or lose your testicles ! ”
89693	89701	89690	89690	he	329	“ In that case , I promise . ”
89834	89841	89842	89842	she	235	“ We ’ve finished look six , ”
89867	89874	89875	89875	My	329	“ Okay . Be right in . ”
89911	89918	89920	89920	Matteo	398	“ She does n’t like me , ”
89925	89938	89901	89901	She	235	“ She does n’t like people with penises . Kiss me again . ”
89954	89971	89939	89939	He	398	“ Holy hell , your mouth is a drug factory . Do you gargle with heroin ? ”
89980	89993	89977	89977	he	398	“ Wait till you see what I can do with my hands . ”
90055	90061	90052	90052	he	398	“ Should I show you ? ”
90088	90092	90052	90052	he	398	“ You betcha . ”
90195	90198	90189	90189	he	398	“ Sorry . ”
90199	90203	90189	90189	he	398	“ For what ? ”
90204	90209	90189	90189	he	398	“ I bit you . ”
90210	90218	90189	90189	he	398	“ I know . Do it again . ”
90266	90276	90277	90277	he	398	“ You like it when I bite your mouth , ”
90284	90294	90277	90277	he	398	“ Let ’s see where else you like it . ”
90398	90406	90395	90395	he	398	“ Fuck , I ’ve wanted this . ”
90555	90562	90563	90563	he	398	“ You like that , too , ”
90570	90575	90576	90576	I	329	“ No more talking . ”
90596	90601	90602	90602	he	398	“ Yes , ma’am , ”
90802	90814	90798	90798	He	398	“ Fuck my mouth , bella . Come in my mouth . ”
91218	91224	91225	91225	He	398	“ You ’re so delicious . ”
91246	91261	91225	91225	He	398	“ So beautiful . So perfect . I could eat you for every meal . ”
91282	91291	91262	91262	I	329	“ Oh stop . Stop it some more . ”
91322	91331	91332	91332	He	398	“ Here . You can even touch it . ”
91378	91387	91389	91389	Matteo	398	“ Oh , she ’s laughing at me , ”
91399	91405	91394	91394	He	398	“ That wo n’t do . ”
91476	91480	91481	91481	Matteo	398	“ Those eyes , ”
91555	91569	91570	91570	I	329	“ I see this big boy has as much patience as you do , ”
91646	91656	91634	91634	His	398	“ All right , pal , hold your horses . ”
91820	91824	91825	91825	he	398	“ Strawberry mouth , ”
91831	91838	91825	91825	he	398	“ I love that soft red — ”
91978	91982	91983	91983	he	398	“ Touch yourself , ”
92057	92061	92062	92062	he	398	“ Not yet , ”
92072	92080	92062	92062	he	398	“ Fuck . Kimber . Not yet . ”
92159	92164	92175	92175	He	398	“ Do you have — ”
92165	92170	92175	92175	He	398	“ Yes , here — ”
92171	92174	92175	92175	He	398	“ Hurry . ”
92533	92541	92542	92542	he	398	“ Ever since I saw first you , ”
92574	92577	92578	92578	I	329	“ What ? ”
92598	92604	92595	92595	he	398	“ I ’ve been yours , ”
92728	92742	92725	92725	I	329	“ If you tell me that was mediocre , I ’ll neuter you . ”
92751	92767	92743	92743	He	398	“ All these threats against my poor testicles . You should be nicer to them . ”
92778	92783	92743	92743	He	398	“ They like you . ”
92784	92790	92792	92792	he	398	“ Oh , lucky me . ”
92802	92809	92792	92792	he	398	“ I like them , too . ”
92815	92823	92810	92810	Matteo	398	“ And some of your other parts . ”
92846	92857	92835	92835	I	329	“ And the guy all the parts are attached to . ”
92858	92862	92863	92863	he	398	“ How romantic , ”
92866	92873	92863	92863	he	398	“ Stop or I ’ll blush . ”
92874	92904	92835	92835	I	329	“ Listen , you just banged me senseless in a dressing room . I ’m in no shape for witty repartee . Can I have my leg back now ? ”
92910	92919	92905	92905	He	398	“ Are you always like this after sex ? ”
92920	92932	92933	92933	I	329	“ Amazingly adorable ? Why , yes . Yes I am . ”
92946	92956	92940	92940	He	398	“ I think I ’m rubbing off on you . ”
92967	92990	92957	92957	I	329	“ I think the rubbing has already been done , sir . Now give me back my leg . I ’m cramping . ”
93035	93044	93032	93032	He	398	“ I could stand here like this forever . ”
93204	93208	93209	93209	Matteo	398	“ Allow me . ”
93254	93260	93261	93261	I	329	“ That was almost professional , ”
93324	93330	93350	93350	his	398	“ You ’re thinking again . ”
93376	93431	93462	93462	Boom	257	“ I was thinking that you ’re incredible , and this was incredible , and I hope we ’ll keep doing this as often as possible , and also that we should take it one day at a time because I need to be smart and not fall in love with you too fast . ”
93447	93461	93432	93432	He	398	“ That ’s unfortunate , considering I ’m already in love with you . ”
93475	93484	93462	93462	Boom	257	“ Wha . . . wha . . . ”
93509	93517	93518	93518	he	398	“ I ’m in love with you , ”
93530	93649	93518	93518	he	398	“ I know it ’s ridiculous , and I know it ’s too soon , and I know I ’m in love with you . I did n’t plan on it . I did n’t even want to admit it to myself until I figured out why I have n’t been able to sleep or eat or think straight since I met you . It ’s either love or it ’s insanity , and I do n’t care which because either way it ’s irreversible . It ’s fatal . No other woman has ever moved me the way you do , and if you decide you do n’t want me , it will be the end of me .
93650	93705	93806	93806	He	398	“ So whatever happens from now on , you ca n’t say you did n’t know . You ca n’t say I did n’t tell you . I ’m telling you straight out : I ’m in love with you , Kimber DiSanto . Even if the pope does think it ’s a sin . ”
93723	93727	93728	93728	I	329	“ The pope ? ”
93732	93744	93728	93728	I	329	“ It ’s a long story . Are you all right ? ”
93750	93769	93745	93745	My	329	“ Oh sure . Of course . Beautiful men tell me every day how much they adore me — ”
93770	93774	93775	93775	Matteo	398	“ Love you , ”
93785	93795	93782	93782	he	398	“ Why are you looking at me like that ? ”
93796	93805	93745	93745	My	329	“ I ’m trying not to pass out . ”
93811	93819	93806	93806	He	398	“ You ’re going to be fine . ”
93820	93828	93782	93782	he	398	“ But what if I pass out ? ”
93829	93843	93806	93806	He	398	“ I ’ll make sure you do n’t hit your head on anything . ”
93853	93872	93844	93844	I	329	“ Okay , I need to say something now , and I hope you wo n’t get mad . ”
93880	93894	93873	93873	He	398	“ I ’ll try not to , but that does n’t sound good . ”
93902	93912	93895	93895	I	329	“ Does this have anything to do with Brad ? ”
93918	93924	93913	93913	He	398	“ What do you mean ? ”
93946	93970	93938	93938	I	329	“ I mean you came in here the other day , saw us hugging , acted weirded out about it , then left . ”
93971	93974	93925	93925	He	398	“ And ? ”
93975	93998	93938	93938	I	329	“ And we have n’t talked about it since . Which means you have no idea what ’s going on between us . ”
94006	94050	93999	93999	He	398	“ That ’s true . I do n’t . But I do know that there ’s no way in hell you would ’ve come anywhere near this dressing room with me if there was any chance you and he were getting back together . ”
94051	94055	93925	93925	He	398	“ Why not ? ”
94065	94086	94056	94056	He	398	“ You ’re a one - man woman . You ’re too good to play that game . Too loyal . ”
94130	94139	94177	94177	He	398	“ You ’ve got that funny look again . ”
94148	94170	94140	94140	I	329	“ I ’m finding it very , very hard not to fall madly in love with you . Like , now . ”
94181	94185	94177	94177	He	398	“ Challenge accepted , ”
94252	94262	94263	94263	Matteo	398	“ Keep your friends close and your enemies closer , ”
94284	94334	94283	94283	MATTEO	398	“ If you ’re going to do this right , Matteo , you have to tell her , and you have to tell her in a way that ca n’t be misunderstood . Forget about being the strong , silent type . Women need to hear the actual words . ”
94363	94370	94354	94373	A man ca n’t simply charge in with an “ I ’m in love with you ” out of nowhere	1516	“ I ’m in love with you ”
94446	94452	94461	94461	She	1516	“ Are you all right ? ”
94453	94456	94457	94457	she	1516	“ Yes , ”
94468	94500	94461	94461	She	1516	“ Then I ’ll assume you ’re so pale because I ’ve just given you the most earth - shattering orgasms of your life . Anything else will crush my ego . ”
94501	94512	94461	94461	She	1516	“ I seriously doubt your ego could even be dented . ”
94568	94577	94597	94597	She	1516	“ I should probably get back to work . ”
94591	94596	94597	94597	She	1516	“ Look at me . ”
94657	94689	94654	94654	I	329	“ I did n’t plan to declare myself like that . It just came out . I ’m sorry it made you uncomfortable . I wo n’t bring it up again . ”
94713	94719	94720	94720	she	1516	“ Do n’t be sorry , ”
94730	94735	94736	94736	She	1516	“ It was beautiful . ”
94790	94793	94795	94795	Kimber	48	“ Shit , ”
94799	94804	94795	94795	Kimber	48	“ Someone ’s here ! ”
94805	94808	94809	94810	a man	428	“ Hello ? ”
94887	94890	94894	94894	Dominic	2615	“ Hello ? ”
94909	94919	94894	94894	Dominic	2615	“ Stay here until I get rid of him . ”
94920	94927	94928	94928	I	329	“ What ? You ’re joking ! ”
94968	94975	94949	94949	she	1516	“ I ’m here ! Hello ! ”
95024	95046	95005	95005	She	1516	“ How are you , tesoro ? I ’ve been so worried about you , living up there with the barracuda . ”
95117	95129	95113	95113	Kimber	48	“ You do n’t have to worry . Things are okay . ”
95130	95133	95134	95134	Dominic	2615	“ Really ? ”
95151	95173	95138	95138	Kimber	48	“ Well , one of her dogs destroyed my entire wardrobe , but that ’s been the only skirmish so far . ”
95174	95206	95207	95207	His	2615	“ You need to be careful , Kimber . I did n’t want to speak of it earlier . Things were already so upsetting with your father ’s passing . . . ”
95211	95256	95207	95207	His	2615	“ But you ca n’t trust that woman for a moment . The son , either . They ’re a pair of real slick operators , those two . You should get rid of her before she figures out how to get the house . ”
95331	95338	95324	95324	she	48	“ Why do you say that ? ”
95353	95445	95350	95350	Dominic	2615	“ Because I know them ! He ’s vicious , and she ’s money hungry . The only reason she married your father is because she thought he had wealth . The house , the business — that ’s what she fell in love with . Not your father . Believe me , I saw how she bled him . And once she found out there was n’t much money to be had , she started pestering him to sell the business . Of course she had a buyer in mind . ”
95450	95456	95446	95446	Kimber	48	“ Of course she did . ”
95504	95514	95496	95496	she	48	“ How do you know about any of that ? ”
95515	95521	95496	95496	she	48	“ Your father told me . ”
95564	95588	95549	95549	her	48	“ But . . . in the hospital . . . he told me he loved her . He said he was happy — ”
95589	95596	95597	95597	Dominic	2615	“ Your father was a romantic , ”
95601	95638	95597	95597	Dominic	2615	“ You know that . A romantic who only saw the best in people . He looked at life through rose - colored glasses . He was a lamb , no match for the Moretti lions . ”
95805	95813	95814	95814	I	329	“ That ’s really upsetting to hear , ”
95822	95831	95814	95814	I	329	“ I do n’t want to believe it . ”
95845	95919	95920	95920	He	2615	“ I know . You have a good heart , like your father . It ’s hard to hear such awful things about people . Believe me , tesoro , I hate to have to tell you . But you ’re like a daughter to me , and now that your father ’s gone , it ’s my job to look after you , yes ? So . This is what you do . ”
95931	95944	95920	95920	He	2615	“ First thing , you turn the marchesa out of the house . ”
95945	95948	95920	95920	He	2615	“ No . ”
95993	96022	95920	95920	He	2615	“ My father specified in his will that she stays in the house until she dies . I have to honor that . It ’s what he wanted . ”
96026	96034	96023	96023	Dominic	2615	“ But she can not be trusted ! ”
96035	96040	96041	96041	I	329	“ He loved her , ”
96045	96076	96041	96041	I	329	“ He was alone for almost thirty years after my mother died , and for whatever reason , the marchesa made him happy . I wo n’t throw her out . ”
96262	96283	96284	96284	Dominic	2615	“ The longer she lives there , the better her case to make a claim of ownership on the property . ”
96307	96322	96371	96371	God	1857	“ And the more she ’ll try to win you over with her wiles ! ”
96323	96336	96371	96371	God	1857	“ Trust me , she ’s not trying to win me over . ”
96337	96359	96371	96371	God	1857	“ No ? She has n’t given you any gifts ? Done anything special for you to make you like her ? ”
96399	96431	96379	96379	I	329	“ Matteo ’s rich . He lives in a castle , for God ’s sake . Their family owns a castle . They ca n’t be that hard up for money ! ”
96445	96481	96432	96432	Dominic	2615	“ Castello di Moretti is owned by the family only in name . The government has a lien on the property . Back taxes , my dear . The upkeep on the place is astronomical . ”
96514	96553	96501	96501	I	329	“ Lorenzo has such a high opinion of her . He seems like such a smart guy , and he ’s been with her for so long , how could he not see what she ’s really like ? ”
96554	96560	96561	96561	Dominic	2615	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
96565	96573	96561	96561	Dominic	2615	“ He ’s in love with her . ”
96606	96609	96610	96610	I	329	“ Right , ”
96725	96738	96716	96716	him	398	“ Sit , sit , you ’re as pale as a ghost ! ”
96827	96832	96821	96821	Dominic	2615	“ Are you sick ? ”
96848	96859	96840	96840	men	740	“ I think I ate some bad fish at lunch , ”
96930	96943	96910	96910	God	1857	“ Let me take you home , Kimber . You should rest . ”
96944	96949	96950	96950	I	329	“ I ’m fine . ”
97011	97017	97018	97018	he	2615	“ You ’re not fine , ”
97021	97032	97018	97018	he	2615	“ You vomited . That ’s the opposite of fine . ”
97129	97134	97121	97121	He	2615	“ You believe him . ”
97174	97181	97182	97182	I	329	“ I do n’t want to . ”
97207	97212	97182	97182	I	329	“ But you do . ”
97246	97263	97235	97235	we	1564	“ Put yourself in my shoes . How would you feel ? What would you think ? ”
97264	97276	97316	97316	I	329	“ Dominic has hated my mother for a very long time . ”
97277	97280	97235	97235	we	1564	“ Why ? ”
97281	97287	97316	97316	I	329	“ She married another man . ”
97296	97301	97290	97290	me	329	“ They were together ? ”
97302	97315	97235	97235	we	1564	“ When they were very young . Before she met my father . ”
97417	97421	97409	97409	he	1262	“ What happened ? ”
97428	97463	97422	97422	He	1262	“ Honestly , I do n’t know the details . The only reason I know at all is because I overheard a discussion between her and your father , shortly before they were married . ”
97475	97483	97464	97464	I	329	“ And ? What did they say ? ”
97520	97664	97489	97489	He	398	“ Your father wanted to lend Dominic money . Apparently it was a regular thing , but my mother insisted he ’d been generous enough and should say no . When he asked why she did n’t like Dominic , she said it was n’t that she did n’t like him , but that she knew his character . After your father pressed her , she admitted they had a brief ‘ entanglement , ’ as she called it , before she married my father . My grandfather did n’t approve of Dominic , so he intervened and separated them . Dominic never believed that it was her father . He blamed her . From then on he made it his mission to discredit her name whenever he could . He spread awful rumors . He never forgave her for breaking his heart . ”
97698	97703	97704	97704	I	329	“ Dominic never married , ”
97714	97737	97704	97704	I	329	“ I remember he used to tell my father he found the only woman in Italy who did n’t care about money . ”
97738	97741	97743	97743	Matteo	398	“ Yes , ”
97746	97838	97743	97743	Matteo	398	“ Dominic always makes a big deal about money . Who has it , who does n’t , why he does n’t have enough . Personally , I think the man never had feelings for my mother . I think he saw a paycheck . I think my grandfather realized it , too . My mother was his only child , and the light of his life . If he thought Dominic was a good man , he never would ’ve separated them , no matter how small Dominic ’s fortune . ”
97855	97872	97839	97839	I	329	“ What about Castello di Moretti ? Does the government really have a lien on it ? ”
97885	97888	97873	97873	Matteo	398	“ No . ”
97930	97934	97935	97935	Clara	235	“ Miss Kimber . ”
97945	97950	97935	97935	Clara	235	“ Yes , Clara ? ”
97951	97956	97958	97958	Matteo	398	“ If you have a moment”—she
97961	97968	97969	97969	She	235	glance—“we need you on look six . ”
97996	98002	97993	97993	he	398	“ Well . I tried . ”
98035	98051	98025	98025	He	398	“ I meant everything I said in the dressing room . At least believe that . ”
98142	98150	98139	98139	I	329	“ My life is a Shakespearean drama ! ”
98158	98205	98155	98155	Clara	235	“ Hopefully not the kind where everyone dies at the end . Are you coming , or should we all go home ? We ’re getting old back here . My husband wants stromboli for dinner tonight , and it ’s not going to make itself . ”
98213	98225	98206	98206	I	329	“ You know my father ’s friend , Dominic , right ? ”
98226	98229	98155	98155	Clara	235	“ Yes . ”
98230	98238	98206	98206	I	329	“ What do you think of him ? ”
98242	98301	98302	98302	She	235	“ He ’s a man . What ’s there to think ? They ’re nothing but overgrown babies . If they do n’t have a woman around to cook for them and coo at them and tell them what to do , they ’re lost . But I do n’t think it ’s Dominic you need advice about . ”
98327	98357	98358	98358	Her	235	“ You ’re a smart girl , and your love life is none of my business . So I ’ll say this , then I ’ll say no more . ”
98371	98405	98367	98367	She	235	“ The egg does not swim to the sperm . Never chase a man . It goes against nature . If you want him , let him chase you until you catch him . ”
98424	98444	98406	98406	She	235	“ And no more sex in the dressing rooms . Who do you think has to clean in there ? ”
98456	98478	98445	98445	She	235	“ If you want to meet a good man , read a book ! Now let ’s get back to work ! ”
98558	98563	98564	98564	I	329	“ The plot thickens , ”
98839	98844	98845	98845	I	329	“ It ’s stealing , ”
98962	98972	99011	99011	Dominic	2615	“ Hello , tesoro . How are you feeling ? ”
98986	99005	98980	98980	I	329	“ I have to ask you something , and I need you to be completely honest with me . ”
99014	99020	99011	99011	Dominic	2615	“ Of course . Anything . ”
99021	99031	99011	99011	Dominic	2615	“ How much money did my father lend you ? ”
99074	99098	99011	99011	Dominic	2615	“ Your father never lent me money ! Where did you get such an idea ? Did that horrible woman tell you that ? ”
99148	99157	99174	99174	I	329	“ I found a ledger my father kept . ”
99194	99203	99191	99191	he	2615	“ I do n’t know anything about that . ”
99231	99252	99223	99223	me	329	“ That ’s very interesting because there ’s a lot of information here about dates , loan amounts . . . ”
99309	99327	99289	99289	his	1440	“ There might have been a few times I needed help here and there over the years . ”
99328	99333	99334	99334	I	329	“ How many times ? ”
99342	99351	99334	99334	I	329	“ How much money did he give you ? ”
99352	99359	99360	99360	he	1440	“ Does n’t your ledger say ? ”
99369	99377	99365	99365	I	329	“ I want you to tell me . ”
99414	99446	99410	99410	He	1440	“ This was between your father and me , Kimberly . It ’s no business of yours . And it ’s disrespectful of you to ask me . Your poor father — ”
99447	99479	99410	99410	He	1440	“ Do n’t you dare talk to me about my ‘ poor ’ father , or about disrespect ! Not even two minutes ago you lied about never getting any money ! ”
99483	99492	99480	99480	He	1440	“ It ’s beneath me to speak of . ”
99537	99549	99493	99493	I	329	“ The Cast - off Couturier Goes on a Murder Spree ! ”
99550	99573	99493	99493	I	329	“ You ’re stonewalling me now ? Then I guess you wo n’t want to talk about your relationship with the marchesa . ”
99581	99589	99493	99493	I	329	“ She has poisoned you against me . ”
99590	99596	99493	99493	I	329	“ Are you denying it ? ”
99597	99606	99493	99493	I	329	“ Whatever she told you is a lie . ”
99607	99623	99493	99493	I	329	“ Okay , then answer me this : Why did you say Matteo was vicious ? ”
99644	99681	99637	99637	he	1610	“ He would n’t allow me to attend the wedding . I tried to go , but he blocked me at the door . He threatened to rip off my head . He ’s an animal . ”
99718	99754	99711	99711	I	329	“ At the hospital , you told me you were n’t invited to the wedding . That no one attended . That it was done in secret . This sounds like a much different story . ”
99773	99884	99711	99711	I	329	“ Your father and I were friends for fifty years ! I was the only one who came to the hospital when he was sick ! I was the only one who stood by him after your mother died and he fell into the bottom of a bottle for so long you had to be sent away to live with your aunt in the States ! I was the one who cared for him during his depression and made sure he ate , and showered , and his business did n’t go under ! Me ! If anything , I deserved the money he gave me ! I earned it ! ”
99945	99948	99916	99916	I	329	“ Pronto ? ”
99949	99953	99956	99956	Mary	55	“ Lady Moretti . ”
99970	99983	99956	99956	Mary	55	“ It ’s Kimber . I hope I ’m not disturbing you . ”
99984	100000	100001	100001	Her	55	“ Kimber ? Is everything all right ? Is it Matteo ? What ’s happened ? ”
100033	100053	100054	100054	I	329	“ Everything ’s okay . Matteo ’s fine . It ’s not about him . I wondered . . . ”
100067	100087	100054	100054	I	329	“ I wondered if I could speak to you for a minute . If we could have a chat . ”
100105	100117	100124	100124	she	55	“ Of course . I ’m happy to talk to you . ”
100127	100134	100124	100124	she	55	“ I ’m glad you called . ”
100175	100199	100170	100170	I	329	“ I think we got off on the wrong foot . Strike that — I know we got off on the wrong foot . ”
100200	100208	100209	100209	Her	55	“ Yes . I believe we did . ”
100256	100266	100231	100231	she	55	“ You ’re sure I ’m not disturbing you ? ”
100267	100292	100237	100237	she	55	“ I ’ve just finished supper , and Lorenzo left a few minutes ago to walk the dogs . This is a good time . ”
100300	100306	100295	100295	we	1615	“ Where does Lorenzo sleep ? ”
100328	100334	100231	100231	she	55	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
100347	100355	100344	100344	they	1616	“ Are you and Lorenzo a couple ? ”
100361	100377	100356	100356	Her	55	“ If we were , his wife would certainly have something to say about it ! ”
100382	100388	100378	100378	I	329	“ Wife ? What wife ? ”
100389	100479	100356	100356	Her	55	“ His quite lovely wife of almost forty years , Barbara . She ’s a darling woman , but if she believed for one moment I had designs on her husband , I ’d be missing my teeth . She ’s German . You should see her arms . The woman could pass for a professional wrestler . They live close to Il Sogno — it ’s the white cottage with the blue door at the bottom of the hill next to the bakery . You ’ve seen it ? ”
100497	100559	100632	100632	her	1617	“ Barbara works the night shift , which is why Lorenzo often stays late . Or comes early , depending how you look at it . And to answer your question directly : no . Lorenzo and I are not romantically involved . He is one of my truest friends , however . He ’s seen me through many difficult times . ”
100571	100624	100560	100560	She	1617	“ Barbara arrives tomorrow on the train . It ’s our annual tradition , a little holiday for all of us . I can get on quite well with the service in the hotel , and Lorenzo and Barbara take in the sights . Milan is so beautiful this time of year . ”
100678	100711	100725	100725	she	1617	“ I hope I get to meet her soon . I ’m sorry I had to ask you that . I do n’t mean to be disrespectful , it ’s just that — ”
100712	100724	100725	100725	she	1617	“ It ’s just that Dominic has been in your ear , ”
100733	100736	100737	100737	I	329	“ Yes . ”
100767	100797	100760	100760	she	1617	“ I wondered how long it would take him . Is there anything else you ’d like to ask me ? Since we ’re having such a nice chat . ”
100821	100836	100813	100813	She	1617	“ Now that you mention it , I do have a few more questions . ”
100837	100842	100813	100813	She	1617	“ I ’m listening . ”
100875	100890	100860	100860	I	329	“ Why did n’t you come to the hospital when my father was sick ? ”
100891	100894	100895	100895	she	1617	“ Oh , ”
100899	100909	100895	100895	she	1617	“ I see you ’ve brought the big guns . ”
100910	100918	100860	100860	I	329	“ I ’m terrible with small talk . ”
100919	100922	100923	100923	She	1617	“ Evidently . ”
100929	101011	100923	100923	She	1617	“ My first husband suffered for more than two years before the cancer finally killed him . We were constantly in and out of the hospital . Everything in our lives revolved around him being sick . I ’m not complaining , you understand , just explaining that was our reality . Waiting for him to die . Watching him get weaker and sicker . The helplessness I felt at not being able to do anything to stop it . . . ”
101044	101118	101037	101037	she	1617	“ When I married your father , he vowed I ’d never go through anything like that with him . He extracted a promise from me that if he were ever to fall sick and have to be hospitalized , I would stay away . I refused at first , but when he said it would be easier on him , not having to watch me watch him waste away , I agreed . ”
101127	101171	101119	101119	Her	1617	“ Since we ’re being so open , I have to tell you it was the hardest thing I ’ve ever done . It nearly killed me to stay away , but that ’s what he wanted . So I honored my promise . ”
101172	101181	101182	101182	I	329	“ And I yelled at you for it , ”
101195	101206	101190	101190	Her	1617	“ Oh , my dear . You did n’t know . ”
101207	101214	101215	101215	I	329	“ I nicknamed you the WS , ”
101225	101230	101215	101215	I	329	“ For Wicked Stepmother . ”
101234	101251	101231	101231	She	1617	“ That ’s rather clever , is n’t it ? I do enjoy a good nickname . ”
101258	101279	101255	101255	She	1617	“ You ’ll be wanting to know about Matteo , of course . He ’s dreadfully in love with you . ”
101297	101300	101290	101290	I	329	“ Uh — ”
101301	101332	101333	101333	She	1617	“ It ’s been giving me such delight watching him try to manage it . He does n’t wear his heart on his sleeve , as you no doubt know . ”
101337	101348	101333	101333	She	1617	“ That runs in the family , I ’m afraid . ”
101370	101423	101424	101424	She	1617	“ When you came in the other night at dinner , he was asking my advice on how to court you . Is n’t that sweet ? So old - fashioned . You would n’t think it to look at him , but he really does n’t have much luck with women . ”
101427	101464	101424	101424	She	1617	“ Always trying to be so macho . He ’s like his father that way . Ca n’t stand to be seen as weak . The ego ! Ha ! It ’s their Achilles ’ heel . ”
101521	101548	101549	101549	She	707	“ Speaking of ego , he ’s also terribly vain . Terribly . His morning routine takes a lifetime . The hair products alone . . . ”
101564	101606	101549	101549	She	707	“ He told me about Maria . About how you always had to have a Great Dane in the house so he would never forget how he refused to come in and see his father on his sickbed before he died . ”
101631	101667	101549	101549	She	707	“ That ’s what he thinks ? That I was punishing him ? I thought it would comfort him to have the same breed as Maria around . He and that dog were so close . ”
101671	101675	101668	101668	I	329	“ Oh crap . ”
101676	101679	101681	101682	the marchesa	62	“ Indeed , ”
101684	101697	101681	101682	the marchesa	62	“ It seems all of us have been operating under false assumptions . ”
101710	101715	101698	101698	I	329	“ One last question . ”
101716	101719	101766	101766	She	62	“ Yes ? ”
101720	101734	101698	101698	I	329	“ Do you know why my father did n’t tell me about you ? ”
101735	101749	101766	101766	She	62	“ I asked him to wait until we could meet face to face . ”
101758	101765	101755	101755	I	329	“ Why would you do that ? ”
101770	101850	101766	101766	She	62	“ Because you ’d never had a mother , and I ’d never had a daughter . I thought . . . it ’s silly , I know , but I thought we could both get what we ’d always been missing at the same time . You ’d arrive after your honeymoon and we ’d meet , and we ’d all be one big happy family . I had a big party planned . Like a surprise party . ”
101856	101868	101766	101766	She	62	“ I ’m sorry , it all seems so stupid now . ”
101910	101932	101766	101766	She	62	“ It ’s not stupid . It ’s lovely . I ’m sorry it did n’t work out like you wanted . ”
101940	101957	101933	101933	Her	62	“ That ’s life , I ’m afraid . It keeps interrupting all our wonderful plans . ”
101958	101968	101933	101933	Her	62	“ I think I owe Matteo a big apology . ”
101969	101978	101933	101933	Her	62	“ Why ? Did you insult his hair ? ”
101979	101990	101933	101933	Her	62	“ It ’s worse than that , I ’m afraid . ”
101995	102019	101991	101991	She	62	“ Just compliment his hair . It goes a long way , believe me . Anything else can be solved with a kiss . ”
102117	102120	102114	102114	Matteo	398	“ Kimber . ”
102141	102148	102151	102151	I	329	“ Yes , it ’s me . ”
102183	102188	102177	102177	I	329	“ Matteo ? Hello ? ”
102419	102422	102449	102449	He	1628	“ Hi . ”
102423	102426	102427	102427	He	1628	“ Buonasera . ”
102436	102448	102449	102449	He	1628	“ Um . . . can we go inside and talk ? ”
102486	102497	102474	102474	he	1628	“ I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . ”
102517	102533	102503	102503	My	329	“ I just wanted to tell you that I ’m sorry . I was confused — ”
102534	102546	102474	102474	he	1628	“ It ’s understandable . Your life is chaotic right now . ”
102547	102553	102503	102503	My	329	“ I spoke to Dominic — ”
102554	102562	102474	102474	he	1628	“ You do n’t have to explain . ”
102563	102575	102503	102503	My	329	“ Clearly I do have to explain because you ’re not — ”
102576	102583	102584	102584	He	1628	“ I ca n’t do this . ”
102630	102633	102621	102621	he	1628	“ Fuck . ”
102649	102672	102643	102643	I	329	“ You ’re breaking up with me . Is that what this is ? You do n’t want to see me anymore ? ”
102691	102698	102673	102673	He	1628	“ Matteo , talk to me . ”
102724	102765	102803	102803	He	1628	“ You need time . Time to grieve your father . Time to grieve your ex . In six months , you ’ll probably feel very differently about everything . Right now , as you said , you ’re confused . ”
102766	102770	102771	102771	I	329	“ Was confused , ”
102776	102779	102771	102771	I	329	“ Was . ”
102791	102802	102780	102780	He	1628	“ I forced this on you . All of it . ”
102839	102852	102853	102853	I	329	“ Hey ! You did n’t force anything on me , pal ! ”
102857	102909	102853	102853	I	329	“ Do n’t paint yourself as the bad guy ! And do n’t paint me as some damsel in distress without any choice in the matter ! What happened in the dressing room happened because we both wanted it . And all those kisses happened because we both wanted them to . ”
102910	102916	102917	102917	he	1628	“ I was blackmailing you , ”
102923	102963	102853	102853	I	329	“ Yeah , you were ! Newsflash — I loved every second of it ! If I did n’t , you ’d have two black eyes and an empty hole between your legs where your dick used to be ! ”
102974	103002	102964	102964	He	1628	“ Do n’t you dare chicken out on me now , Moretti . I will be so mad at you if you chicken out on me now . ”
103003	103014	103015	103015	he	1628	“ Calling me poultry is n’t going to help anything , ”
103021	103034	102964	102964	He	1628	“ I ’ll call you a goddamn wet noodle if I want ! ”
103042	103046	103039	103039	He	1628	“ That mouth , ”
103131	103134	103123	103123	he	1628	“ Fuck ! ”
103146	103160	103135	103135	He	1628	“ I ’ll call you a taxi . Go wait by the gate . ”
103226	103229	103404	103404	I	329	“ Hello ? ”
103230	103237	103213	103213	I	329	“ Hey , it ’s me . ”
103238	103248	103249	103249	I	329	“ Now is n’t a good time , Brad . ”
103275	103284	103213	103213	I	329	“ What ’s wrong ? You sound weird . ”
103285	103323	103213	103213	I	329	“ It ’s nothing much . Just an existential crisis that will undoubtedly leave some major scars on my heart , my psyche , and my ability to successfully interact with the rest of the human race . ”
103324	103339	103213	103213	I	329	“ Good luck with that . What ’re you eating ? It sounds good . ”
103340	103350	103351	103351	I	329	“ You ’re as empathetic as a dirt clod , ”
103356	103366	103213	103213	I	329	“ Sorry . Do you wanna talk about it ? ”
103367	103381	103429	103429	Brad	418	“ I ’d rather have my eyeteeth pulled . What do you want ? ”
103382	103403	103213	103213	I	329	“ I wanted to find out when exactly this modeling thing I ’m doing for you is going to happen . ”
103415	103421	103404	103404	I	329	“ It ’s not happening . ”
103422	103428	103429	103429	Brad	418	“ What ? Why not ? ”
103442	103464	103429	103429	Brad	418	“ Because the reason I wanted to do it in the first place no longer exists . Why do you care ? ”
103476	103508	103473	103473	he	1635	“ Because . . . it ’s how I ’m supposed to be making it up to you . About the ditching - you - at - the - altar thing . ”
103509	103525	103526	103526	I	329	“ I ’m aware of why you ’re supposed to be making amends to me , ”
103530	103538	103526	103526	I	329	“ Now tell me the real reason . ”
103550	103561	103539	103539	He	1635	“ Fine . I had someone I wanted to invite . ”
103565	103592	103562	103562	I	329	“ Your mother was going to fly all the way to Italy to watch you in a fashion show ? I thought she only wanted pictures . ”
103593	103599	103539	103539	He	1635	“ It ’s someone else . ”
103620	103625	103600	103600	I	329	“ Really ? Who ? ”
103626	103629	103562	103562	I	329	“ Giancarlo . ”
103630	103639	103600	103600	I	329	“ Giancarlo ? Who the hell is Giancarlo ? ”
103651	103663	103641	103641	Brad	418	“ Oh my God . You have a boyfriend ? Already ? ”
103664	103684	103562	103562	I	329	“ Do n’t act so scandalized ! I ’m not the only one with a new boyfriend , girlfriend ! ”
103692	103711	103689	103689	I	329	“ Good point . And if you ever call me girlfriend again , I ’ll rebreak your nose . ”
103727	103738	103724	103724	Brad	418	“ You let Jenner call you girlfriend all the time . ”
103739	103753	103754	103754	My	329	“ Dig that hole any deeper and I ’ll bury you in it . ”
103760	103780	103754	103754	My	329	“ And I do n’t have a boyfriend . Matteo and I . . . it ’s not happening . ”
103781	103791	103792	103792	Brad	418	“ Why not ? Did you have a fight ? ”
103808	103826	103797	103797	I	329	“ We were never together in the first place . But now we ’re really not together . ”
103827	103842	103792	103792	Brad	418	“ Oh , well , that makes perfect sense . Thanks for the explanation . ”
103851	103868	103843	103843	He	1636	“ Not that I owe you an explanation , but . . . it ’s complicated . ”
103872	103882	103869	103869	Brad	418	“ You farted in bed , did n’t you ? ”
103883	103889	103890	103890	I	329	“ That happened one time ! ”
103893	103905	103890	103890	I	329	“ And you promised you ’d never bring it up again ! ”
103909	103958	103906	103906	He	1636	“ You know you should n’t eat beans , Kimber . You ca n’t digest them . If I were a weaker man , I ’d be dead right now . That fart was , like , killer . It took months for my nose hair to regrow . ”
103959	103965	103966	103966	I	329	“ This is n’t happening . ”
103976	104015	103966	103966	I	329	“ I ’m not having this conversation right now . I ’m somewhere in a locked room with padded walls , wearing a nice comfy straitjacket , having a respectable mental breakdown . This is not my life . ”
104016	104031	104043	104043	Giancarlo	268	“ I ’m gon na call you right back . Do n’t go anywhere . ”
104087	104103	104080	104080	Brad	418	“ I ’ve got Jenner and Danielle on the line . I conferenced them in . ”
104104	104112	104080	104080	Brad	418	“ You did what ? What the — ”
104113	104116	104118	104118	Danielle	1931	“ Honey , ”
104123	104131	104118	104118	Danielle	1931	“ Brad said you ’re in trouble — ”
104132	104135	104137	104137	Jenner	418	“ Poppins ? ”
104139	104150	104137	104137	Jenner	418	“ What ’s all this about ? Are you okay ? ”
104203	104216	104200	104200	Jenner	418	“ I do n’t understand why you ’re calling us , though . ”
104220	104234	104217	104217	Brad	418	“ She ’s my best friend . I want her to be happy . ”
104249	104281	104246	104246	I	329	“ I think there ’s a small piece of information the rest of the group is missing , Brad . Up to you if you want to share it or not . ”
104282	104289	104346	104346	Brad	418	“ You did n’t tell them ? ”
104302	104312	104290	104290	He	418	“ Not my place . Already told you that . ”
104313	104318	104319	104319	he	418	“ Not even Jenner ? ”
104326	104330	104332	104332	Jenner	418	“ Excuse me , ”
104335	104345	104332	104332	Jenner	418	“ but what the bloody hell is going on ? ”
104349	104358	104359	104359	He	418	“ Um . I , um . . . ”
104369	104374	104359	104359	He	418	“ You tell them . ”
104392	104411	104412	104412	Danielle	1931	“ So , do you guys remember where Brad and I were going to go on our honeymoon ? ”
104415	104420	104412	104412	Danielle	1931	“ The dude ranch ? ”
104424	104429	104421	104421	Jenner	418	“ What about it ? ”
104430	104457	104421	104421	Jenner	418	“ Two things . The first is that it ’s where Brad wanted to go . The second is that it ’s a. Dude . Ranch . ”
104473	104476	104469	104469	Jenner	418	“ No . ”
104484	104487	104480	104480	Brad	418	“ Yeah . ”
104495	104500	104492	104492	Danielle	1931	“ What ’s happening ? ”
104509	104526	104501	104501	Jenner	418	“ If I ’m not mistaken , what ’s happening is that Brad just came out . ”
104527	104534	104492	104492	Danielle	1931	“ Came out ? Of where ? ”
104535	104549	104551	104551	Jenner	418	“ For God ’s sake , what has Ohio done to your brain ? ”
104555	104566	104568	104571	an equally exasperated Danielle	1643	“ Excuse me for not being able to read minds , ”
104573	104587	104568	104571	an equally exasperated Danielle	1643	“ And I ’ll have you know , Ohio is a wonderful place ! ”
104588	104603	104605	104605	Brad	418	“ I do n’t know , I might be with Jenner on this one , ”
104610	104630	104605	104605	Brad	418	“ I went to Cleveland once and almost got mugged outside a church at ten o’clock in the morning . ”
104647	104654	104642	104642	I	329	“ Brad is gay , Danielle . ”
104672	104693	104655	104655	She	1643	“ It ’s true . I ’m gay . That ’s why I could n’t go through with the wedding . ”
104703	104711	104694	104694	Danielle	1931	“ Gay ? I do n’t understand . ”
104712	104721	104722	104722	I	329	“ That was my exact reaction , too . ”
104736	104746	104748	104748	Jenner	418	“ I ’m surprised I did n’t see it , ”
104750	104768	104748	104748	Jenner	418	“ but I ’m glad you pulled the plug on the wedding , for both your sakes . ”
104773	104786	104748	104748	Jenner	418	“ We ’ll talk about how you should ’ve handled that later . ”
104787	104803	104804	104804	I	329	“ I appreciate the support , but I ’ve already put him through the wringer . ”
104824	104833	104820	104820	Nebbiolo	269	“ Besides , what ’s done is done . ”
104834	104837	104839	104839	Brad	418	“ Right ! ”
104844	104861	104839	104839	Brad	418	“ What we need to concentrate on now is getting her back together with her stepbrother ! ”
104865	104875	104862	104862	Danielle	1931	“ This is the strangest phone call in history . ”
104876	104894	104896	104896	Jenner	418	“ We ’re going to need the full backstory if you want us to be any help , ”
104945	104949	104950	104950	Brad	418	“ Hold on , ”
104953	104976	104950	104950	Brad	418	“ You were gon na make me wear a dress ? When were you gon na get around to telling me that ? ”
104977	104994	104995	104995	I	329	“ At about the same time you got around to telling me the wedding was off , ”
104999	105038	104995	104995	I	329	“ Because there ’s nothing quite like being humiliated in front of hundreds of people while wearing a couture gown handmade for the occasion . You did say you ’d do anything to make it up to me . ”
105044	105070	105039	105039	That	270	“ Let ’s cut to the chase , shall we ? How do you feel about him ? Are you in love with this man ? ”
105078	105110	105071	105071	Jenner	418	“ It would be ridiculous , would n’t it ? So soon after meeting him ? So soon after my relationship with Brad ending ? So soon . . . period ? ”
105111	105118	105173	105173	Brad	418	“ That ’s not an answer . ”
105119	105128	105130	105130	Danielle	1931	“ It would be romantic , not ridiculous , ”
105132	105160	105130	105130	Danielle	1931	“ I knew as soon as I met Brian that he was the one . Took one look — boom . And your kids would be gorgeous . ”
105161	105172	105173	105173	Brad	418	“ Whoa ! No one ’s talking about having kids . ”
105176	105187	105173	105173	Brad	418	“ She ’s right . Your kids would be gorgeous . ”
105194	105199	105188	105188	Jenner	418	“ Ugh . Breeders . ”
105200	105221	105188	105188	Jenner	418	“ Can we move on from the kid talk and the love talk ? What am I supposed to do ? ”
105222	105253	105188	105188	Jenner	418	“ Get your head straight and figure out how you feel . It ’s not right to pursue him because you ’re lonely , or because Satan bruised your ego . ”
105254	105257	105259	105259	Brad	418	“ Hey , ”
105263	105270	105259	105259	Brad	418	“ Did you nickname me Satan ? ”
105271	105285	105287	105287	Danielle	1931	“ Yes , and it ’s an insult to the lord of darkness , ”
105289	105293	105295	105295	Jenner	418	“ I think , ”
105300	105358	105295	105295	Jenner	418	“ you should do exactly as Matteo suggested and take some time . You ’ve endured some of the most traumatic things that can happen to a person , all within the space of a month . You ended a significant relationship . Your father died . You moved to another country . Your business burned down — ”
105359	105365	105367	105367	Brad	418	“ Your business burned down ? ”
105385	105391	105392	105393	thunders Jenner	418	“ As I was saying , ”
105395	105436	105392	105393	thunders Jenner	418	“ Even if it were possible for you to know without a doubt how you feel right now , it ’s impossible to begin a relationship that has any chance of lasting during such a chaotic time in your life . ”
105575	105584	105663	105663	he	1651	“ I have to dig in my heels . ”
105588	105591	105585	105585	Everyone	1878	“ What ? ”
105592	105637	105585	105585	Everyone	1878	“ It ’s a long story . Listen — I love you guys . Thank you so much for worrying about me , and thank you for being my friends . But I think I know what I need to do . And Brad ? ”
105638	105641	105585	105585	Everyone	1878	“ Yeah ? ”
105642	105661	105585	105585	Everyone	1878	“ You ’re not totally off the hook , but making this phone call goes a long way . ”
105666	105669	105670	105670	he	1651	“ Thanks , ”
105674	105680	105585	105585	Everyone	1878	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
105681	105695	105734	105734	her	1652	“ Um . . . I sorta liked the idea of the dress . ”
105773	105776	105766	105766	I	329	“ Answer . ”
105777	105782	105766	105766	I	329	“ It ’s you . ”
105783	105794	105766	105766	I	329	“ It ’s me . Please do n’t hang up . ”
105795	105802	105766	105766	I	329	“ I was n’t going to . ”
105803	105821	105766	105766	I	329	“ Good . Because I need to say important things , and I need you to listen . ”
105851	105857	105831	105831	I	329	“ Have you been drinking ? ”
105858	105861	105862	105862	She	1652	“ Yes ! ”
105871	105888	105862	105862	She	1652	“ But not because I needed liquid courage to call you . Because I was depressed . ”
105917	105923	105862	105862	She	1652	“ Are you still there ? ”
105924	105929	105930	105930	I	329	“ I ’m here . ”
105935	105948	105930	105930	I	329	“ And I do n’t like the idea of you drinking alone . ”
105949	106059	105862	105862	She	1652	“ Cut me some slack , Count . It ’s not every day I get dumped by the man of my dreams . And before you ask , no , I did n’t get drunk after Brad left me at the altar , and no , he was n’t the man of my dreams . He was a fantasy I made up in my head who ticked off a bunch of boxes that did n’t matter because they were n’t real . You ’re real . You ’re what I was looking for all along , only I was too busy dealing with all my disasters to realize it . ”
106066	106096	106060	106060	She	1656	“ Though I have to admit that you ’re incredibly irritating when you want to be . I ’ve never met anyone who can do smug better than you . ”
106145	106154	106138	106138	I	329	“ I ’ve had a lot of practice . ”
106168	106182	106155	106155	She	1656	“ You get a gold star for effort , that ’s for sure . ”
106255	106295	106317	106317	She	1656	“ M’kay , you ’re doing your silent smoldering thing , so I ’m just gon na go ahead and talk , and you can be over there all broody and non - sharey to your heart ’s content . ”
106296	106305	106306	106306	I	329	“ Exactly how much alcohol did you drink ? ”
106311	106316	106317	106317	She	1656	“ I want you . ”
106362	106399	106317	106317	She	1656	“ I want you because you ’re smart , and you ’re funny , and you ’re talented , and you respect your mother , and you make me feel capable of murder , and flight . ”
106400	106403	106317	106317	She	1656	“ Flight ? ”
106404	106432	106317	106317	She	1656	“ When you kiss me , I feel like I grow wings . It ’s a cliché , but it ’s true , so bear with me . ”
106440	106482	106317	106317	She	1656	“ I want you because I ’ve never met anyone who challenges me like you do . Who looks at me like you do . Who makes my heart stop beating the way you do when you walk into a room . ”
106524	106532	106521	106521	she	62	“ Also , your hair is incredible . ”
106541	106550	106534	106534	I	329	“ You ’ve been talking to my mother . ”
106551	106557	106521	106521	she	62	“ I really like her . ”
106558	106563	106534	106534	I	329	“ You sound surprised . ”
106564	106569	106521	106521	she	62	“ I am surprised . ”
106573	106584	106570	106570	I	329	“ She ’s an acquired taste . But worth it . ”
106585	106591	106592	106592	She	62	“ Totally . Moving on . ”
106595	106611	106592	106592	She	62	“ I have many more compliments for you if you ’d like to hear them . ”
106622	106644	106612	106612	God	1857	“ I ’d like to hear you drink a large glass of water , take aspirin , and go to bed . ”
106649	106662	106645	106645	Her	62	“ Why do n’t you come over and put me to bed ? ”
106676	106687	106645	106645	Her	62	“ Was that a yes groan or a no groan ? ”
106688	106696	106645	106645	Her	62	“ It was a groan of frustration . ”
106697	106716	106717	106717	She	62	“ Drive over here and be frustrated . We can be frustrated together . Until we ’re not . ”
106720	106728	106729	106729	I	329	“ I ca n’t be a rebound , ”
106736	106763	106729	106729	I	329	“ I ca n’t be a placeholder or a crutch until you get your life together . I meant what I said : you need time — ”
106764	106785	106786	106786	she	62	“ What I need is for you to stop telling me what I need and get your ass over here , ”
106790	106817	106786	106786	she	62	“ What I need is to kiss you and apologize and tell you all about how I was plotting to crash your show at Fashion Week . ”
106829	106836	106837	106837	she	62	“ Yeah , it was dumb , ”
106847	106915	106837	106837	she	62	“ I was gon na make Brad wear a really pretty dress I ’ve been working on — hopefully Jenner and some of his model friends , too , but he was n’t on board yet — and get up on the catwalk with a sign around his neck that read Moretti Sucks Balls . Or something like that . I had n’t exactly figured it out yet .
106916	106961	106837	106837	she	62	“ But you broke up with me , and I realized it was a stupid plan and it was n’t revenge I wanted , it was you . And the way to get you probably did n’t involve making a scene at your show . ”
106969	106987	106962	106962	She	62	“ Who is Jenner , and why the hell would your ex agree to wear a dress ? ”
106988	107030	107060	107060	she	62	“ Jenner ’s my best friend from San Francisco . You ’ll meet him , he ’s great . He ’s coming to Italy for Fashion Week . And Brad ’s still trying to make amends for the whole wedding debacle . ”
107082	107086	107076	107076	she	62	“ unfinished business . ”
107135	107138	107139	107139	she	62	“ Hello ? ”
107145	107149	107139	107139	she	62	“ Still here . ”
107150	107157	107139	107139	she	62	“ Are you mad at me ? ”
107158	107163	107164	107164	I	329	“ No , bella , ”
107177	107198	107164	107164	I	329	“ But you ’ve been drinking , and I already told you I do n’t take advantage of incapacitated women . ”
107199	107205	107206	107206	she	62	“ I am very capacitated , ”
107336	107343	107344	107344	I	329	“ Go to sleep , bella , ”
107353	107361	107362	107362	She	62	“ You ’re blowing me off again ? ”
107392	107401	107408	107408	I	329	“ No , I ’m saying good night . ”
107416	107427	107428	107428	she	62	“ I ca n’t believe my groveling did n’t work , ”
107433	107442	107428	107428	she	62	“ That was some A - plus groveling . ”
107443	107451	107486	107486	She	62	“ It was . Go to sleep . ”
107455	107485	107452	107452	She	62	“ Fine . But if I die of alcohol poisoning , you ca n’t say I did n’t try to convince you to come over here and save me . ”
107636	107640	107646	107646	me	329	“ You snore , ”
107658	107665	107655	107655	He	1668	“ No , I do n’t . ”
107666	107670	107671	107671	Matteo	398	“ Like this . ”
107682	107691	107655	107655	He	1668	“ You ’re lying ! I do not ! ”
107718	107726	107695	107695	him	272	“ I ’ll record it next time . ”
107759	107768	107727	107727	I	329	“ You ’re under the covers with me . ”
107769	107773	107803	107803	his	272	“ I am . ”
107774	107783	107727	107727	I	329	“ And you have all your clothes on . ”
107784	107794	107803	107803	his	272	“ You have a gift for stating the obvious . ”
107837	107850	107834	107834	I	329	“ I did n’t die from alcohol poisoning . Wanna know why ? ”
107861	107869	107851	107851	His	272	“ Because you came and saved me . ”
107870	107876	107851	107851	His	272	“ You ’re deeply strange . ”
107877	107883	107851	107851	His	272	“ C’m on . Play . ”
107921	107949	107918	107918	He	272	“ Yes . I rode in on my stallion and saved you from a wine overdose . I ’m a true hero . I deserve a parade . ”
107950	107956	107957	107957	I	329	“ At least a plaque , ”
107962	107968	107918	107918	He	272	“ Or a commemorative mug . ”
107969	107976	107977	107977	he	272	“ I ’m angry with you , ”
107994	108002	107988	107988	My	329	“ Because of what happened with Dominic ? ”
108003	108027	107977	107977	he	272	“ Because this is the second time I ’ve been awake all night worried about you choking to death on your own vomit . ”
108036	108039	108028	108028	I	329	“ Ew . ”
108040	108051	107988	107988	My	329	“ Precisely . Do we need to talk about this ? ”
108073	108105	108052	108052	I	329	“ Before I met you , I ’d only had one other hangover in my life . It was the first and last time I drank gin . I was sixteen . ”
108106	108118	108167	108167	His	272	“ So you ’re telling me it ’s not a habit . ”
108119	108130	108052	108052	I	329	“ I ’m telling you it ’s not a habit . ”
108153	108166	108150	108150	I	329	“ You ’re very protective for someone who ’s giving me space . ”
108175	108191	108167	108167	His	272	“ Have you ever heard the expression , ‘ Do n’t poke the bear ’ ? ”
108192	108197	108167	108167	His	272	“ Yes . Why ? ”
108198	108206	108167	108167	His	272	“ Because you are poking the bear . ”
108207	108212	108213	108213	I	329	“ I ’m sorry . ”
108222	108281	108213	108213	I	329	“ But I ’m crazy about the bear , and I do n’t like it when he does n’t want to be around me , so I have to chase after him with a stick and poke him until he pays attention to me again . Even though the egg is n’t supposed to chase after the sperm . ”
108297	108306	108282	108282	Matteo	398	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
108332	108339	108325	108326	this man	329	“ Do you even have pores ? ”
108343	108349	108340	108340	He	329	“ You ’re still drunk . ”
108350	108366	108340	108340	He	329	“ No , I ’m sober . It ’s just that you ’re incredibly handsome . ”
108371	108380	108367	108367	His	329	“ You ’re trying to butter me up . ”
108381	108386	108340	108340	He	329	“ Is it working ? ”
108387	108397	108367	108367	His	329	“ No . I ’m still angry with you . ”
108398	108405	108340	108340	He	329	“ I thought we made up ! ”
108413	108417	108406	108406	He	329	“ Did we ? ”
108424	108441	108419	108419	he	329	“ Even if we did , I ’m still angry . And you still need time . ”
108442	108476	108419	108419	he	329	“ There you go , telling me what I need again . I think you should listen to someone else who ’s telling you what I need . His ideas are much better . ”
108510	108513	108496	108496	Matteo	398	“ Stop . ”
108514	108536	108496	108496	Matteo	398	“ You ’re in bed with me with a raging hard - on . You do n’t want me to stop . ”
108588	108606	108607	108607	he	398	“ I ’m in bed with you because you hung up on me after threatening to die , ”
108636	108650	108631	108631	He	398	“ Do n’t . Look . At . Me . Like . That . ”
108651	108657	108612	108612	he	398	“ Make love to me . ”
108668	108686	108658	108658	He	398	“ You want to kill me , is that it ? You ’re hoping to murder me ? ”
108687	108697	108698	108698	I	329	“ I can think of worse ways to go . ”
108728	108737	108710	108710	He	398	“ What is this thing you ’re wearing ? ”
108738	108757	108710	108710	He	398	“ A nightie . I put it on hoping you ’d come over . Do you like it ? ”
108758	108775	108776	108776	He	398	“ It ’s not a nightie , it ’s a torture device . I hate it . ”
108805	108810	108811	108811	I	329	“ Let me go , ”
108859	108862	108863	108863	he	398	“ No , ”
108872	108880	108863	108863	he	398	“ I do n’t think I will . ”
108943	108946	108935	108935	His	398	“ Matteo — ”
108947	108950	108935	108935	His	398	“ Quiet . ”
109045	109053	109033	109033	He	398	“ Hey ! Where are you going ? ”
109054	109057	109058	109058	he	398	“ Aspirin , ”
109064	109067	109058	109058	he	398	“ Water . ”
109094	109109	109058	109058	he	398	“ What was that noise ? Do we have two bears in the room ? ”
109110	109122	109123	109123	I	329	“ You ’re so lucky I ’m tied up right now , ”
109140	109175	109123	109123	I	329	“ If I was n’t tied up , I ’d kick your butt . I ’d do such a gnarly karate chop on your head , it would fly clean off . I ’d — ”
109176	109186	109187	109187	He	398	“ Good thing you are tied up , then . ”
109224	109232	109221	109221	he	398	“ Is this punishment for believing Dominic ? ”
109233	109258	109259	109259	He	398	“ No . This is punishment for making me worry and shaving years off my life with that mouth of yours . Take these . ”
109314	109327	109298	109298	He	398	“ But you know I wo n’t let you suffer too long . ”
109368	109380	109365	109365	he	398	“ Or maybe I will . I have n’t decided yet . ”
109410	109415	109416	109416	He	398	“ Mmm . Lace . ”
109469	109475	109476	109476	he	398	“ So pink and hard , ”
109486	109502	109476	109476	he	398	“ Wet from my tongue . Where else are you pink and wet , bella ? ”
109642	109646	109647	109647	he	398	“ No panties , ”
109740	109746	109747	109747	he	398	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
109769	109777	109747	109747	he	398	“ God , you turn me on . ”
109778	109792	109793	109793	I	329	“ Right back atcha , hot stuff . I need to touch you . ”
109871	109879	109861	109861	I	329	“ Please . Oh God , please . ”

109889	109895	109861	109861	I	329	“ Please make me come . ”
109896	109903	109854	109854	His	398	“ How ? Mouth or cock ? ”
109923	109928	109854	109854	His	398	“ Certo . Both . ”
109963	109968	109956	109956	he	398	“ Ohh . . . ”
110236	110241	110242	110242	he	398	“ Beautiful . Beautiful , ”
110277	110296	110272	110272	I	329	“ Sweetheart , oh sweetheart , oh God , did I hurt you ? What ’s the matter ? ”
110342	110367	110334	110334	He	398	“ I ’m so sorry ! I thought you liked it , I thought it felt good for you , I should have asked — ”
110368	110384	110385	110385	He	398	“ Do n’t be sorry . That was the most incredible orgasm of my life . ”
110394	110397	110385	110385	He	398	“ Really ? ”
110403	110414	110398	110398	I	329	“ Yes , really . I think I saw God . ”
110433	110436	110426	110426	he	398	“ Jesus . ”
110437	110448	110415	110415	He	398	“ Him too . There might have also been cherubs . ”
110461	110471	110449	110449	Matteo	398	“ What am I going to do with you ? ”
110472	110480	110481	110481	He	398	“ More of the same , please . ”
110557	110560	110561	110561	He	398	“ Oh . ”
110566	110571	110561	110561	He	398	“ What is it ? ”
110572	110580	110561	110561	He	398	“ I did n’t bring a condom . ”
110592	110615	110581	110581	I	329	“ Like when a woman does n’t shave her legs before a date so she wo n’t be tempted to have sex . ”
110616	110619	110561	110561	He	398	“ Exactly . ”
110629	110643	110620	110620	I	329	“ I ’m clean . I was just tested . So . . . ”
110655	110667	110644	110644	His	398	“ So . . . bare is what you ’re saying . ”
110675	110685	110668	110668	I	329	“ As long as you ’re clean , too . ”
110686	110690	110691	110691	he	398	“ I am , ”
110695	110712	110691	110691	he	398	“ I have the papers at the house if you want me to go get them . ”
110729	110741	110742	110742	He	398	“ Okay . Now that that ’s out of the way . ”
110779	110788	110771	110771	I	329	“ Wow . Just . . . wow . ”
110789	110796	110771	110771	I	329	“ Thank you . I think . ”
110797	110807	110771	110771	I	329	“ Get your ass in this bed this instant . ”
110859	110864	110855	110855	he	398	“ You ’re soaked . ”
110865	110869	110870	110870	I	329	“ Your fault . ”
110879	110896	110870	110870	I	329	“ Oh God , this is all your fault if you stop I will kill you . ”
110897	110902	110903	110903	he	398	“ And so hot , ”
110909	110925	110903	110903	he	398	“ You feel so amazing . You feel like heaven , bella , fucking heaven . ”
111070	111080	111067	111067	I	329	“ I have an IUD . Come inside me . ”
111081	111084	111085	111085	he	398	“ God , ”
111092	111100	111085	111085	he	398	“ Could you be any more perfect ? ”
111389	111394	111395	111395	His	398	“ You ’re thinking . ”
111425	111431	111395	111395	His	398	“ How could you tell ? ”
111432	111438	111404	111404	He	398	“ I smell something burning . ”
111439	111442	111395	111395	His	398	“ Ha . ”
111497	111501	111483	111483	His	398	“ Tell me . ”
111519	111538	111502	111502	I	329	“ This might be easier for me to deal with if you were poor and looked like Shrek . ”
111539	111553	111554	111554	he	398	“ I ’ll sell the castle and give all the money to charity , ”
111558	111570	111554	111554	he	398	“ I ’ll gain two hundred pounds and paint myself green . ”
111571	111574	111575	111575	I	329	“ Good . ”
111605	111631	111647	111647	He	398	“ If it makes you feel any better , from now on I ’ll only tell you all the things I find irritating about you . ”
111642	111646	111632	111632	I	329	“ Like what ? ”
111657	111673	111647	111647	He	398	“ Your calm , even temper , for instance . Your sweet , loving tongue . ”
111678	111694	111674	111674	I	329	“ You thought my tongue was pretty sweet when it was wrapped around your dick . ”
111702	111709	111699	111699	He	398	“ My kingdom for that mouth . ”
111722	111732	111719	111719	I	329	“ You do n’t have a kingdom , Count . ”
111733	111740	111719	111719	I	329	“ The hell I do n’t . ”
111753	111779	111741	111741	I	329	“ Okay . Sure . You ’re the king of the fashion world . The ruler of ready to wear . The liege of lederhosen — ”
111780	111789	111790	111790	he	398	“ You know I do n’t make lederhosen , ”
111805	111816	111817	111817	He	398	“ And call me Count one more time . . . ”
111826	111829	111817	111817	He	398	“ Ow ! ”
111853	111859	111844	111844	I	329	“ You bit my boob ! ”
111878	111884	111875	111875	he	398	“ You fucking loved it . ”
111922	111934	111902	111902	he	398	“ And you love me , too . Do n’t you ? ”
111956	111970	111902	111902	he	398	“ I thought . . . you wanted me . . . space . ”
112009	112022	112023	112023	he	398	“ I want you to tell me how you feel about me , ”
112032	112107	112023	112023	he	398	“ I want you to be brave and put it all out there . To my face this time . We can take it slow . It does n’t have to change anything . But if you do n’t think this is going anywhere , I need to know . I meant what I said yesterday . I ca n’t be a rebound . For anyone else , yes , but not for you . ”
112117	112134	112108	112108	I	329	“ I already told you I ’ve never wanted anything as much as I want you . ”
112144	112156	112135	112135	He	398	“ And that I ’m terrified you ’ll break my heart . ”
112174	112178	112179	112179	he	398	“ What else ? ”
112182	112188	112179	112179	he	398	“ That ’s not enough ? ”
112189	112193	112157	112157	He	398	“ Indulge me . ”
112209	112219	112194	112194	I	329	“ I do n’t think you ’re a rebound . ”
112220	112226	112179	112179	he	398	“ You do n’t think ? ”
112235	112243	112245	112245	he	398	“ I mean I ’m pretty sure . ”
112252	112261	112245	112245	he	398	“ I ’m almost a hundred percent sure ! ”
112359	112368	112356	112356	I	329	“ Please do n’t be angry with me . ”
112377	112388	112369	112369	He	398	“ I ’m not . I ’m angry with myself . ”
112405	112419	112369	112369	He	398	“ Matteo , please do n’t go . Let ’s talk about this . ”
112420	112428	112369	112369	He	398	“ Why ? Will it change anything ? ”
112429	112438	112369	112369	He	398	“ Please , I want you to understand — ”
112439	112444	112445	112445	he	398	“ I understand perfectly , ”
112454	112502	112445	112445	he	398	“ This is what I was trying to avoid . This is why I told you to take your time . Then you got drunk and told me I was what you were looking for . You paid me wonderful compliments . You even complimented my hair . ”
112518	112558	112559	112559	His	398	“ You gave me everything I wanted . You gave me all of you . You let go . Only you did n’t , because when I asked you if you loved me , you would n’t say yes . ”
112564	112581	112559	112559	His	398	“ Not because you could n’t , because I think you do . You would n’t . ”
112582	112595	112619	112619	he	398	“ You ’re the one who keeps telling me I need time ! ”
112596	112600	112601	112601	he	398	“ You do ! ”
112604	112613	112601	112601	he	398	“ And you ’re going to get it ! ”
112662	112669	112670	112670	I	329	“ Do n’t you dare cry , ”
112685	112691	112670	112670	I	329	“ Do n’t you dare . ”
112875	112885	112923	112923	She	235	“ You chased the sperm , did n’t you ? ”
112886	112898	112923	112923	She	235	“ Relationships are more complicated than eggs and sperm , Clara ! ”
112899	112922	112923	112923	She	235	“ You want a complicated relationship , get a cat . Men are as complex as ferns . Do n’t overthink it . ”
112954	112957	112923	112923	She	235	“ Hello ? ”
112958	112963	112923	112923	She	235	“ Hey , Kimber . ”
112976	112988	112964	112964	I	329	“ Hi , Brad . Will you do me a favor ? ”
112989	112996	112923	112923	She	235	“ Sure ! What is it ? ”
112997	113019	112964	112964	I	329	“ The next time I develop feelings for someone , just shoot me in the heart and Super Glue my vagina . ”
113027	113038	112923	112923	She	235	“ I take it the Matteo situation is n’t improving . ”
113039	113042	112923	112923	She	235	“ Correct . ”
113043	113053	112923	112923	She	235	“ Do you want me to talk to him ? ”
113063	113073	113054	113054	My	329	“ Of course not ! Was that a joke ? ”
113074	113093	113110	113110	He	329	“ I ’m just saying , it might help . I can explain to him about your personality . ”
113094	113100	113101	113101	I	329	“ What about my personality ? ”
113126	113161	113110	113110	He	329	“ The stubbornness . The temper . The way you always have to win . I wo n’t tell him about the gas , though . He ’s on his own in that department . ”
113174	113181	113162	113162	I	329	“ How is this my life ? ”
113182	113189	113190	113190	He	329	“ In other news . . . ”
113196	113202	113190	113190	He	329	“ I ’m moving here . ”
113203	113214	113162	113162	I	329	“ Here ? Where here ? I ’m very confused . ”
113219	113228	113215	113215	Brad	418	“ To Florence ! Is n’t that awesome ? ”
113229	113239	113240	113240	I	329	“ I can think of a few other words , ”
113246	113261	113240	113240	I	329	“ Why are you moving here ? Your whole life is in San Francisco ! ”
113262	113272	113300	113300	he	329	“ No it ’s not . You ’re here . ”
113304	113310	113300	113300	he	329	“ And so is Gio . ”
113311	113314	113300	113300	he	329	“ Gio ? ”
113315	113324	113300	113300	he	329	“ Giancarlo . I told you about him . ”
113338	113349	113334	113334	I	329	“ You ’re that serious about this guy ? Already ? ”
113350	113356	113357	113357	he	329	“ Oh hellooo , pot , ”
113361	113377	113357	113357	he	329	“ Kettle here . Let ’s have lunch and talk about the definition of irony . ”
113408	113414	113406	113406	him	329	“ What about your parents ? ”
113420	113432	113415	113415	His	329	“ They still think I ’m trying to get you back . ”
113433	113447	113415	113415	His	329	“ Have you thought about what you ’re going to do about that ? ”
113448	113464	113415	113415	His	329	“ Nope . Have you thought about what you ’re going to do about Matteo ? ”
113465	113494	113415	113415	His	329	“ He ’s giving me space to make sure he ’s not a rebound . There ’s nothing to do except make sure he ’s not a rebound . ”
113495	113500	113502	113502	Brad	418	“ He ’s not , ”
113514	113545	113502	113502	Brad	418	“ I know you , and I know you have real feelings for him . It might be bad timing , but that ’s not the end of the world . ”
113546	113567	113655	113655	He	329	“ Thank you , Dr. Phil . I wish you would ’ve been this clear - sighted about our wedding . ”
113568	113606	113502	113502	Brad	418	“ Me too . Sorry again , by the way . If we ’re not doing the modeling thing , you ’ll have to think of some other way for me to make it up to you . ”
113636	113645	113632	113632	I	329	“ Just be happy . That ’s enough . ”
113646	113654	113655	113655	He	329	“ You want me to be happy ? ”
113688	113726	113680	113680	I	329	“ I ’d hate to think we went through all that trauma and neither of us was better for it in the end . So yes . I want you to be happy . You deserve it . ”
113738	113751	113680	113680	I	329	“ For God ’s sake , are you taking hormones or something ? ”
113755	113766	113752	113752	He	329	“ Do n’t shout at me ! I ’m emotional ! ”
113767	113775	113776	113776	I	329	“ Really ? I had n’t noticed . ”
113811	113823	113776	113776	I	329	“ I have to go now . My straitjacket is calling . ”
113824	113827	113828	113828	He	329	“ Fine . ”
113837	113851	113828	113828	He	329	“ But if you need to talk about Matteo , I ’m here . ”
113936	113942	113929	113929	I	329	“ We have n’t talked . ”
114045	114054	114055	114055	I	329	“ Kimberella got her invitation to the ball , ”
114340	114350	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ The sequined powder blue with the ostrich cuffs , ”
114365	114369	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ Too dramatic . ”
114370	114381	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ The leather and satin with buckles on the waist . ”
114382	114386	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ Too edgy . ”
114387	114396	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ The red silk with the plunging neckline . ”
114397	114401	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ Too sexy . ”
114402	114414	114352	114352	Clara	235	“ The sleeveless purple with the sheer overlay on the skirt . ”
114540	114552	114531	114531	I	329	“ That ’s it ! Clara , you ’re a genius . ”
114553	114557	114558	114558	she	235	“ I know , ”
114561	114572	114558	114558	she	235	“ Now what are we going to do about lunch ? ”
114682	114686	114674	114674	he	1879	“ Moshi moshi . ”
114687	114700	114674	114674	he	1879	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re inside the Japanese guy again . ”
114705	114716	114701	114701	He	1879	“ Alas , lovely Hiro and I have parted ways . ”
114717	114731	114732	114732	I	329	“ But you ’ll forever honor his memory when you answer the phone , ”
114737	114760	114674	114674	he	1879	“ I ’m sentimental that way . How are you , darling ? You sound better than the last time we spoke . ”
114761	114774	114701	114701	He	1879	“ I ’m a little better , mainly because of the invitation . ”
114789	114792	114775	114775	I	329	“ Invitation ? ”
114793	114803	114674	114674	he	1879	“ To Matteo ’s show at the Royal Palace . ”
114804	114817	114775	114775	I	329	“ So you wo n’t have to crash the gig after all ! ”
114818	114826	114674	114674	he	1879	“ We , I think you meant . ”
114830	114849	114827	114827	He	1879	“ I deny all knowledge of your ludicrous scheme and would happily tell that to any concerned authorities . ”
114850	114863	114775	114775	I	329	“ Puh . You know I would ’ve talked you into it . ”
114864	114868	114869	114869	he	1879	“ Of course , ”
114873	114907	114869	114869	he	1879	“ But only because I ’m frightened you ’ll clobber me . I was there when you rearranged Satan ’s nose , if you recall . How is he , by the way ? ”
114908	114920	114775	114775	I	329	“ Still gay . And in love with someone named Giancarlo . ”
114921	114924	114926	114926	Jenner	418	“ Giancarlo , ”
114928	114960	114926	114926	Jenner	418	“ How delicious . I think I ’m in love with him , too . Pity I ’ll never meet him . I could avenge your honor by breaking them up . ”
114961	115026	114775	114775	I	329	“ Oh , you ’ll probably meet him . Brad has decided he ’s moving to Florence to be with the new boy toy . And he ’s hanging on to me like a bad head cold . I ’m sure if I told him I was going to Milan for the show , he and Gio would be on the next train out . ”
115034	115046	115031	115031	Jenner	418	“ Well , no one can say your life is boring . ”
115069	115086	115130	115130	He	418	“ I could do with a little boring right about now , let me tell you . ”
115087	115100	115130	115130	He	418	“ What ’s new with the wicked stepmother and your doggie stepsisters ? ”
115101	115129	115130	115130	He	418	“ It turns out she is n’t so wicked . God , I have a lot to catch you up on . When can I see you ? ”
115286	115290	115276	115276	him	418	“ Stop fidgeting . ”
115291	115300	115276	115276	him	418	“ Hurry up ! I ’ll be late ! ”
115337	115356	115332	115332	He	418	“ Half - up , half - down . Sophisticated but sexy . Congratulations , you ’re perfect . ”
115357	115368	115369	115369	I	329	“ I ’m also sweating through this friggin ’ dress , ”
115457	115466	115450	115450	Jenner	418	“ Just breathe , darling . Like so . ”
115483	115490	115467	115467	He	418	“ I know how to breathe . ”
115491	115501	115502	115502	He	418	“ Clearly you do n’t . You ’re hyperventilating . ”
115522	115527	115528	115528	I	329	“ Ugh . Fine . ”
115538	115541	115528	115528	I	329	“ Oh , ”
115549	115554	115542	115542	I	329	“ That actually works . ”
115558	115567	115555	115555	He	418	“ Now we ’re going to practice walking . ”
115568	115579	115555	115555	He	418	“ Walking ? I already know how to do that ! ”
115587	115607	115608	115608	He	418	“ When wearing couture , one does n’t simply stomp around as if mashing grapes underfoot . One glides . ”
115636	115673	115580	115580	He	418	“ I ’ll never be able to copy that , catwalk boy . And thanks for that ego - boosting description of how I move . It was just the shot in the arm I needed . ”
115685	115707	115680	115680	he	418	“ Oh , Poppins . I tease . Your walk is lovely . I ’m only trying to loosen you up . ”
115708	115731	115680	115680	he	418	“ Please , no more loosening . It ’s having the opposite effect . I ’m wound so tight I might snap . ”
115732	115736	115737	115737	he	418	“ I know , ”
115751	115788	115737	115737	he	418	“ It all feels a bit déjà vu , does n’t it ? The last time we were in a room together prepping you for a big event , it did n’t end quite as planned . ”
115789	115800	115801	115801	I	329	“ Hopefully this time will be different . Knock wood . ”
115813	115826	115737	115737	he	418	“ Very funny . At least you ’re not carrying calla lilies . ”
115827	115837	115737	115737	he	418	“ That reminds me . Where ’s my clutch ? ”
115838	115841	115842	115842	He	418	“ Here . ”
115857	115866	115842	115842	He	418	“ What ’s in this thing ? Rocks ? ”
115867	115895	115737	115737	he	418	“ Lip gloss , my phone , and a giant stack of business cards . If all goes well I ’ll be handing them out like candy . ”
115899	115915	115896	115896	He	418	“ I love it that you ’re going into this with such an entrepreneurial spirit . ”
115936	115968	115916	115916	I	329	“ It would be smarter if I were going into it with a belly full of Xanax . God , this is worse than the wedding . My nerves are shot ! ”
115984	115996	115981	115981	Jenner	418	“ You really have feelings for him , do n’t you ? ”
116001	116024	115981	115981	Jenner	418	“ Turns out that old adage ‘ Absence makes the heart grow fonder ’ is true . I just wish . . . ”
116035	116038	116032	116032	Jenner	418	“ What ? ”
116049	116057	116039	116039	I	329	“ I wish it could be easier . ”
116058	116061	116039	116039	I	329	“ It ? ”
116062	116079	116039	116039	I	329	“ Love . Relationships . Why does it all have to be so confusing and convoluted ? ”
116090	116161	116080	116080	He	418	“ Because real life is n’t a fairy tale , darling , and making a relationship last is hard . Love involves a lot of forgiveness . People are n’t perfect . Falling in love is easy , but staying in love is a choice . You have to decide if the ups and downs are worth sticking out because there will be plenty of them . There will be pain .
116162	116267	116348	116348	I	329	“ That ’s where we all go wrong , expecting love to be a Hallmark commercial where you run through a field of clover into each other ’s arms and live happily ever after with no regrets . True love is when you can look at someone and say , ‘ I know you will hurt me and disappoint me and fail me in a thousand different ways , and I accept that because you make me a better person . Because with you I become whole . Because I ’d rather die than live a single day without you , come what may . ”
116284	116302	116277	116277	I	329	“ Honestly , you ’re the last person in the world I would ’ve expected that from . ”
116321	116347	116311	116311	he	329	“ Not all of us are brave enough to risk our hearts being broken more than once . Not all of us could survive it . ”
116401	116411	116397	116397	I	329	“ Are you gon na tell me about it ? ”
116427	116458	116412	116412	He	329	“ Not right before you hop into your carriage to head off to the ball . Come on , let ’s get going . I have a surprise for you . ”
116459	116462	116412	116412	He	329	“ Xanax ? ”
116463	116491	116412	116412	He	329	“ Better . A limo . And you do n’t have to worry about it turning into a pumpkin at midnight . I paid extra for that . ”
116676	116681	116682	116682	he	1723	“ Buongiorno , bellissima , ”
117029	117035	117046	117046	She	2517	“ Mi scusi , signorina . ”
117172	117175	117158	117158	I	329	“ Yes ? ”
117190	117201	117176	117177	The woman	2517	“ I ’m sorry , I do n’t speak Italian . ”
117206	117216	117202	117203	Anna Wintour	291	“ She wants to know who you ’re wearing . ”
117217	117227	117228	117228	I	329	“ Oh ! Me ! I ’m wearing me ! ”
117250	117256	117243	117243	Anna	291	“ You ’re a designer ? ”
117285	117293	117265	117265	she	2517	“ Yes . Here ’s my card . ”
117326	117329	117330	117331	The two	1740	“ Grazie . ”
118717	118720	118721	118721	I	329	“ Okay , ”
118728	118731	118721	118721	I	329	“ Okay . ”
118986	119000	118963	118963	she	49	“ Matteo ! We have to start ! What are you waiting for ! ”
119533	119540	119519	119519	I	329	“ Poppins ! You ’re awake ! ”
119608	119626	119605	119605	Jenner	418	“ Oh God . Nurse ! Nurse ! She ’s awake ! She ’s making strange noises ! ”
119655	119658	119659	119659	I	329	“ Mrpf ! ”
119664	119673	119675	119676	the nurse	1980	“ How are you feeling , Miss DiSanto ? ”
119696	119700	119701	119701	I	329	“ Everything hurts . ”
119734	119744	119701	119701	I	329	“ Good ! That ’s a very good girl . ”
119762	119766	119753	119753	I	329	“ What happened ? ”
119767	119779	119746	119747	this guy	418	“ You ’ve had a bad spill , I ’m afraid . ”
119780	119784	119785	119785	I	329	“ How bad ? ”
119819	119825	119826	119826	My	329	“ How bad is it ? ”
119841	119850	119852	119852	Jenner	418	“ You ’re going to be just fine , ”
119866	119908	119852	119852	Jenner	418	“ I ’m fucked , are n’t I ? I ’m paralyzed ! I ’m a quadriplegic ! Oh God , just tell me the truth ! I ’ll be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life , right ? ”
119924	119940	119919	119919	Jenner	418	“ If you knew what she ’s been through lately , you ’d get it . ”
119941	119950	119952	119953	the nurse	1980	“ You ’re not paralyzed , Miss DiSanto , ”
119956	119962	119963	119963	I	329	“ How do you know ? ”
119972	119984	119968	119968	He	418	“ Because of the death grip you have on my arm . ”
120004	120010	120011	120011	I	329	“ What about my legs ? ”
120018	120027	120011	120011	I	329	“ Why ca n’t I move my legs ? ”
120032	120038	120028	120028	Jenner	418	“ Could be the casts . ”
120039	120051	120028	120028	Jenner	418	“ Casts ? Plural ? I have casts on my legs ? ”
120052	120072	120073	120073	He	418	“ And on your left arm . Apparently your bones are as brittle as a sardine ’s , love . ”
120077	120087	120073	120073	He	418	“ At least you did n’t snap your neck ! ”
120088	120094	120095	120095	I	329	“ What about my brain ? ”
120111	120150	120095	120095	I	329	“ Do I have brain damage ? Swelling ? Posttraumatic whatever ? Am I going to need help feeding myself and forget everyone ’s names and get lost when I go for a drive in my own neighborhood ? ”
120164	120187	120151	120151	I	329	“ You have no brain damage . The scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage or swelling , and the EEG was normal . ”
120226	120249	120306	120307	The nurse	1980	“ Just relax , miss . I ’ll have the doctor come in and go over everything with you , all right ? ”
120285	120288	120289	120289	I	329	“ Okay , ”
120297	120305	120289	120289	I	329	“ Tell him to bring good drugs . ”
120310	120318	120306	120307	The nurse	1980	“ I can help you with that . ”
120383	120387	120388	120388	I	329	“ Oh boy . ”
120393	120401	120388	120388	I	329	“ Those are good drugs . Lord . ”
120402	120414	120415	120415	He	1980	“ If you need another dose , just push the button . ”
120440	120447	120388	120388	I	329	“ How did I get here ? ”
120461	120466	120448	120448	Jenner	418	“ In an ambulance . ”
120467	120473	120448	120448	Jenner	418	“ How are you here ? ”
120474	120482	120448	120448	Jenner	418	“ Believe it or not , Brad . ”
120521	120528	120517	120517	I	329	“ I do n’t get it . ”
120529	120546	120583	120583	Duh	296	“ The paramedics found your phone in your handbag . Brad was under your emergency contacts . ”
120563	120573	120556	120556	I	329	“ How ’d they get past the lock screen ? ”
120574	120578	120579	120579	He	329	“ Your thumb . ”
120585	120597	120598	120598	I	329	“ So they called Brad . Who was in . . . ”
120610	120613	120598	120598	I	329	“ Florence . ”
120614	120629	120583	120583	Duh	296	“ Yes . He called me , and I got here before he did — ”
120630	120637	120638	120638	I	329	“ Wait , he ’s here ? ”
120656	120661	120638	120638	I	329	“ Ta - da ! ”
120662	120668	120671	120671	Jenner	418	“ He was . Earlier . ”
120711	120718	120746	120746	Matteo	398	“ How long’ve I been out ? ”
120719	120728	120746	120746	Matteo	398	“ Since they brought you in last night . ”
120761	120764	120746	120746	Matteo	398	“ Poppins ? ”
120768	120779	120765	120765	I	329	“ Matteo . He used my designs in his show . ”
120786	120790	120783	120783	Jenner	418	“ I know . ”
120800	120806	120791	120791	I	329	“ You do ? How ? ”
120900	120905	120907	120907	Brad	418	“ You ’re awake ! ”
120916	120926	120927	120927	Brad	418	“ Do n’t remind me . Who ’s this ? ”
120948	120953	120927	120927	Brad	418	“ This is Gio . ”
120977	120982	120967	120967	I	329	“ Hello , Gio . ”
120983	120986	120987	120987	he	1804	“ Buongiorno , ”
121039	121048	121024	121024	he	1804	“ So , Kimber , let ’s talk . ”
121049	121068	121024	121024	he	1804	“ Why do you sound like an attorney all of a sudden ? Is this about your trust ? ”
121076	121104	121069	121069	He	1804	“ The trust ? No , this is about you . I wanna talk about how you ’re doing . What ’s going through your mind today ? ”
121157	121181	121153	121153	I	329	“ Cut the crap , Wingate . I ’m lying here in pieces . What do you think is going through my mind ? ”
121182	121219	121138	121138	I	329	“ I do n’t know , that ’s why I ’m asking . Last I heard , you and Matteo had separated because he was giving you time to make sure he was n’t a rebound . ”
121248	121257	121258	121258	I	329	“ Maybe we can talk about this later , ”
121298	121317	121295	121295	Brad	418	“ Jenner told us you went to Matteo ’s show at the palace . So . . . ? ”
121354	121366	121351	121351	I	329	“ I did . And then I fell down the stairs . ”
121372	121389	121367	121367	Brad	418	“ Back up . What happened in between the arriving and the falling down the stairs ? ”
121390	121396	121351	121351	I	329	“ Why are you shouting ? ”
121404	121422	121397	121397	He	121	“ C’m on . Talk . You ’ll feel better if you get it off your chest . ”
121428	121476	121423	121423	I	329	“ You know , he was never this kumbaya , touchy - feely , let’s - sit - in - a - circle - and - share - our - deepest - darkest when he was with me . You ’ve been a good influence on him . ”
121485	121488	121477	121477	Gio	281	“ Grazie . ”
121489	121498	121499	121499	I	329	“ Watch out for the gambling , though , ”
121502	121541	121499	121499	I	329	“ And he can never figure out what he wants to eat at a restaurant . It ’s the worst . You ’ll be there all night . You ’ll age years before he decides on an appetizer . ”
121549	121560	121542	121542	Brad	418	“ Enough about me , we ’re talking about you ! ”
121574	121667	121561	121561	I	329	“ Oh , me ? Let ’s see . Where to start ? I was dumped at the altar by my fiancé . Well , you know that part . My father died . I inherited everything . My dress shop burned down . I moved to Italy and took over my father ’s business . I hated my new stepmother , but then I did n’t . My fiancé came out of the closet — oh , you know that , too . Then I fell in love with my stepbrother — ”
121668	121674	121675	121675	I	329	“ What did you say ? ”
121685	121690	121691	121691	he	329	“ That last part , ”
121694	121699	121691	121691	he	329	“ About your stepbrother . ”
121710	121719	121700	121700	I	329	“ Oh right . My ex - stepbrother . ”
121733	121742	121720	121720	Brad	418	“ What about him ? The other part ! ”
121743	121752	121753	121753	I	329	“ The falling - in - love part ? ”
121770	121773	121765	121765	Jenner	418	“ Yes ! ”
121777	121800	121774	121774	I	329	“ Geez , guys , dial it down a notch . Man down over here , in case you had n’t noticed . ”
121825	121865	121866	121866	I	329	“ Yes . I ’m in love with him . I did n’t want to fall in love with him , but how could I not ? He ’s very . . . he ’s just so . . . ”
121874	121887	121866	121866	I	329	“ Wonderful . He ’s the most wonderful man in the world . ”
121912	121920	121898	121898	He	1810	“ So he was n’t a rebound . ”
121921	121949	122014	122015	Poor Gio	281	“ No . Oh . Are you looking for some credit for dumping me so I could find someone better ? Is that what ’s happening here ? ”
121955	121970	121950	121950	Brad	418	“ Better ? I mean , he ’s a great guy , but better ? ”
121975	121985	121971	121971	Jenner	418	“ Let ’s not get off track , Satan . ”
121986	122000	121971	121971	Jenner	418	“ You know I do n’t like it when you call me that ! ”
122001	122013	121971	121971	Jenner	418	“ Fine . I ’ll demote you to Beelzebub . Happy ? ”
122025	122043	121971	121971	Jenner	418	“ Even if he did use all my designs in his show , I still love him . ”
122101	122207	122092	122092	I	329	“ I know . You do n’t have to tell me . It ’s silly . But it ’s the truth . Even if he ’s been lying to me , and using me , and planned it all from the beginning , he still has my heart . It ’s like that thing you said , Jenner , what was it ? Oh yes . ‘ Because I ’d rather die than live a single day without him , come what may . ’ It ’s not the dresses that are important , or my pride , or anything else . It ’s him . ”
122215	122323	122208	122208	I	329	“ I accidentally walked in on his backstage area when I was looking for the bathroom . I saw all my dresses on his models . . . and I was so angry , and shocked , but most of all hurt . I was devastated . I ran away . Then I got to the top of the stairs and could n’t take another step . I wanted to hear him out . I wanted him to explain because even though I saw it with my own eyes , I did n’t believe he ’d betray me . My heart would n’t let me believe it . ”
122328	122356	122324	122324	My	329	“ Then I tripped on the hem of my dress and went ass over teakettle , and that ’s the end of that sad story right there . ”
122363	122369	122370	122370	he	398	“ Only it ’s not , ”
122381	122388	122370	122370	he	398	“ It ’s just the beginning . ”
122485	122541	122473	122473	he	398	“ I was n’t lying to you . The only thing I planned was to make sure your talent got all the accolades it deserves . Because I love you , too . More than I want my next breath . More than anything . More than life itself , bella , I love you . ”
122542	122545	122546	122546	I	329	“ Oh , ”
122558	122567	122546	122546	I	329	“ That sounds like a win - win . ”
122626	122636	122637	122637	he	398	“ I thought you ’d gone back to Brad , ”
122641	122653	122637	122637	he	398	“ I thought you ’d decided you did n’t want me . ”
122654	122661	122662	122662	I	329	“ Oh , Brad ’s gay , ”
122684	122704	122681	122681	He	398	“ Yes , I got that . You enjoyed watching me get jealous over him , did n’t you ? ”
122705	122735	122681	122681	He	398	“ Yes ! Boy , that was fun . Your show was gorgeous . The roses , God . Must ’ve cost a fortune . Was it a success ? ”
122750	122774	122741	122741	He	398	“ The press is calling it my best show yet . Everyone is raving about my collaboration with the electrifying new American designer . ”
122797	122804	122815	122815	He	398	“ Did you guess the theme ? ”
122805	122814	122815	122815	He	398	“ Um . . . roses are red ? ”
122823	122827	122828	122828	he	398	“ True romance , ”
122841	122845	122828	122828	he	398	“ After us . ”
122846	122867	122828	122828	he	398	“ I do n’t know , we ’ve had a pretty busted - up love story so far , Count . ”
122882	122905	122868	122868	He	398	“ I ’d spank you for calling me Count , but given your current condition , I ’ll take a rain check . ”
122906	122909	122910	122910	I	329	“ Spanking . ”
122914	122927	122828	122828	he	398	“ You ’re as high as a kite , are n’t you ? ”
122928	122947	122828	122828	he	398	“ Yes . How come you told me you would n’t use my designs but then you did ? ”
122948	123024	123025	123025	His	329	“ I said I would n’t use them and not give you credit . That ’s very different . Your name was on the program , in all the promotional materials , everything . I was going to make this whole speech at the end about how love inspired the new collection and the collaboration , but there was an empty seat in the front row , and I was so depressed I dropped it . ”
123030	123037	123025	123025	His	329	“ Are you angry with me ? ”
123042	123069	123038	123038	I	329	“ Normally I do n’t like surprises , but this one seems pretty good . Maybe you should tell me everything , starting from the beginning . ”
123183	123191	123192	123192	I	329	“ I ca n’t believe it worked , ”
123199	123205	123192	123192	I	329	“ I am so predictable . ”
123209	123225	123206	123206	He	329	“ Not exactly . More than once I thought you were going to castrate me . ”
123226	123238	123206	123206	He	329	“ How did you find out I was here ? Jenner ? ”
123244	123295	123239	123239	He	329	“ Brad called me and told me what happened . He told me you were in love with me but were too scared to admit it because of what he ’d done . Then he told me he was gay , and a lot of other things suddenly made sense . ”
123296	123317	123239	123239	He	329	“ Whose idea was it to hide you behind the curtain so you could hear my teary confession of love ? ”
123338	123362	123318	123318	Matteo	398	“ You have him to thank for that , too . He ’s more clever than I would ’ve given him credit for . ”
123390	123393	123394	123394	I	329	“ Honey , ”
123407	123417	123394	123394	I	329	“ I think you sat on my drug button . ”
123425	123429	123418	123418	Matteo	398	“ Oh shit . ”
123430	123433	123434	123434	I	329	“ Yeah , ”
123448	123459	123434	123434	I	329	“ You should probably kiss me before I pass out . ”
123479	123490	123476	123476	He	398	“ Ti amo , bella . Ti amerò per sempre . ”
123491	123506	123476	123476	He	398	“ Right back atcha , hot stuff . I love you forever , too . ”
123681	123688	123689	123689	I	329	“ Winston Churchill ’s hairy balls ! ”
123718	123727	123711	123711	Jenner	418	“ You ’re always stealing my best lines . ”
123728	123745	123711	123711	Jenner	418	“ I ’ve been saving that one for a special occasion . Today seemed particularly apropos . ”
123754	123761	123746	123746	He	418	“ Come give us a hug . ”
123812	123818	123819	123819	he	418	“ Is n’t it strange ? ”
123836	123839	123819	123819	he	418	“ What ? ”
123854	123926	123846	123846	I	329	“ Life . I never would ’ve thought in a million years I ’d be here , now , getting ready to walk down the aisle toward the man of my dreams to take vows that are n’t recognized by the legal system of this country . If you ’d told me a year ago any of it would be happening , I ’d have laughed you out of the room . ”
123927	123948	123949	123949	He	418	“ You would have scorned me out of the room , with withering disdain that would ’ve left permanent scars . ”
123962	123974	123949	123949	He	418	“ Yes , I would have . But here we are . ”
123975	123980	123981	123981	I	329	“ Here we are . ”
123990	124005	123981	123981	I	329	“ Who knew you had a real heart hidden away under all that tin ? ”
124006	124009	124010	124010	he	418	“ Tundra , ”
124014	124031	124010	124010	he	418	“ And do n’t get cheeky with me , darling . It ’s my wedding day . ”
124032	124072	123981	123981	I	329	“ I ’ll get as cheeky as I want , my friend , considering if I ’d never broken three - quarters of the bones in my limbs , you ’d never have met the man of your dreams . ”
124073	124076	124077	124077	He	418	“ True . ”
124082	124095	124077	124077	He	418	“ But a nurse . I could n’t even land a doctor ? ”
124096	124104	124105	124105	I	329	“ The heart wants what it wants , ”
124112	124117	124118	124118	He	418	“ Indeed it does . ”
124125	124139	124140	124140	He	418	“ Oh , Poppins . This is the happiest day of my life . ”
124150	124170	124140	124140	He	418	“ If Toni stops the ceremony to announce he ’s straight , I expect you to break his nose ! ”
124250	124255	124256	124256	I	329	“ Are you ready ? ”
124259	124264	124243	124243	I	329	“ I ’m ready . ”
124265	124275	124243	124243	I	329	“ Chin up . Back straight . Tits out . ”
124276	124288	124289	124289	he	418	“ God , you ’ve got a memory like an elephant , ”
124421	124425	124419	124419	Pachelbel	66	“ Canon in D. ”
124449	124465	124446	124446	Jenner	418	“ That ghastly song . We can never get away from it , can we ? ”
124466	124485	124486	124486	Jenner	418	“ If I ever get married again , I ’ll strangle the musician who dares to play it . ”
124828	124840	124825	124825	he	398	“ How soon can we get you out of this dress ? ”
124844	124853	124841	124841	I	329	“ Weddings make you horny , do they ? ”
124854	124860	124861	124861	He	398	“ You make me horny . ”
124886	124888	124878	124878	I	329	“ lick ”
124890	124892	124878	124878	I	329	“ forever ”
124955	124999	124948	124948	He	111	“ You ’ll have to keep it in your pants until after the toasts , hot stuff . I ’ve got the best man speech to give . Maybe we can have a quickie in the bathroom between that and the first dance . ”
125000	125009	125010	125010	he	398	“ You know I do n’t do quickies , ”
125036	125048	125018	125018	I	329	“ Hey , lovebirds , are you coming inside or what ? ”
125111	125118	125093	125093	I	329	“ Yes , we ’re coming . ”
125207	125217	125219	125219	Matteo	398	“ You ’re a better person than I am , ”
125227	125241	125219	125219	Matteo	398	“ I never would ’ve forgiven him for taking money from your father . ”
125256	125305	125249	125249	he	2615	“ Though it ’s my personal specialty , grudges are n’t something Papa believed in . I know he would ’ve wanted me to work it out . And Dominic did apologize and offer to pay the money back , so he got credit for making an effort . ”
125310	125334	125306	125306	Matteo	398	“ Until he apologizes to my mother for the way he ’s treated her , he ’ll always be on my shit list . ”
125343	125354	125335	125335	I	329	“ Why do you think I invited him , Count ? ”
125362	125372	125355	125355	He	1912	“ What is it you have against my title ? ”
125388	125407	125378	125378	I	329	“ Nothing at all . I just love how much it annoys you when I call you Count . ”
125408	125424	125426	125426	his	1912	“ So it ’s not that you ’d rather be a countess than Marchesa Moretti . ”
125455	125466	125446	125446	I	329	“ I think someone already has dibs on that title . ”
125467	125482	125483	125483	he	1912	“ And I think it ’s time we had another marchesa in the family , ”
125516	125527	125507	125507	he	1912	“ Uh . . . I , uh . . . ”
125528	125535	125536	125536	he	1912	“ You ‘ uh ’ what ? ”
125546	125560	125536	125536	he	1912	“ You ‘ uh ’ want to see the ring before you decide ? ”
125561	125565	125566	125566	I	329	“ The ring ? ”
125597	125614	125615	125615	He	1912	“ Unless you ’d rather not . I know you ’re not that keen about matrimony . ”
125618	125628	125615	125615	He	1912	“ It ’s pretty nice , though . Big . ”
125670	125674	125664	125664	I	329	“ How big ? ”
125675	125678	125679	125679	He	1912	“ Massive . ”
125685	125726	125679	125679	He	1912	“ Now that I think about it , it ’s completely gaudy . You would n’t want to wear it anyway . Diamonds that large only attract the wrong kind of attention . People will think you ’re showing off . ”
125733	125819	125727	125727	He	1912	“ You ’d probably be a target for muggers . You would n’t be able to wear it in public , that ’s for sure . Just around the house . No , maybe not even there — the servants would talk , someone would plan a theft . I suppose you ’d have to keep the thing locked up in a safe where the light of all those flawless carats can shine without the threat of being stolen . Hey , should we dance ? ”
125820	125829	125830	125830	I	329	“ Where is this horrible , gaudy ring ? ”
125845	125857	125830	125830	I	329	“ Show it to me now or I ’ll kill you ! ”
125880	125889	125858	125858	He	1912	“ It ’s in my pocket , bella . ”
125897	125913	125890	125890	I	329	“ And here I thought all this time you were just happy to see me . ”
125976	125979	125980	125980	I	329	“ Jesus , ”
125990	126022	125980	125980	I	329	“ That is gaudy . Tell me it ’s cubic zirconia , I do n’t want to think you had to put the castle in hock to buy that awful thing . ”
126023	126028	126029	126029	he	398	“ I love you , ”
126039	126045	126029	126029	he	398	“ Will you marry me ? ”
126055	126071	126029	126029	he	398	“ I can hardly say no after you bought me the world ’s biggest diamond . ”
126072	126077	126078	126078	he	398	“ My plan exactly , ”
126083	126092	126078	126078	he	398	“ But that was n’t officially a yes . ”
126122	126125	126126	126126	I	329	“ Yes , ”
126133	126146	126126	126126	I	329	“ Officially , yes . I love you with all my heart . ”
126147	126157	126195	126195	he	398	“ It ’s the hair , is n’t it ? ”
126158	126165	126126	126126	I	329	“ Shut up and kiss me . ”
126166	126173	126195	126195	he	398	“ God , you ’re bossy . ”
126174	126188	126126	126126	I	329	“ No , I ’m just really good at digging in my heels . ”
