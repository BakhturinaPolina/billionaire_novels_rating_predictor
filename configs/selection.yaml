# Model selection configuration (Pareto efficiency)

# Outlier filtering (applied before constraints)
# Filters models with too few topics that may have artificially high scores
outlier_filtering:
  max_diversity: 0.9  # Maximum diversity threshold (filters extreme values, likely few topics)
  use_iqr: true  # Use IQR method for outlier detection
  iqr_multiplier: 1.5  # IQR multiplier (1.5 = standard, higher = more lenient)

# Constraints
constraints:
  min_nr_topics: null  # Minimum number of topics required (null = no limit)
  max_nr_topics: null  # Maximum (null = no limit)
  min_coherence: null  # Minimum coherence score (null = no limit)
  min_diversity: null  # Minimum diversity score (null = no limit)

# Pareto optimization
pareto:
  objectives:
    - "coherence"  # Maximize coherence
    - "diversity"  # Maximize diversity
  direction: "maximize"  # maximize both objectives
  
# Selection criteria
selection:
  top_k: 10  # Number of top models to select
  tie_breaker: "coherence"  # If tied, prefer higher coherence

# Output
